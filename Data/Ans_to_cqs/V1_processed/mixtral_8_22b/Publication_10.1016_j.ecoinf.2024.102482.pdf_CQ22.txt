The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score. Accuracy is calculated as the sum of true positives (TP) and true negatives (TN) divided by the total number of instances (TP + TN + false positives (FP) + false negatives (FN)). Recall is computed as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives (TP / (TP + FN)), while precision is determined as the proportion of true positives among all positive predictions (TP / (TP + FP)). Lastly, the F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, which provides a single measure of overall performance. All these metrics have their own strengths and weaknesses, and they should be chosen according to the specific requirements and goals of the task at hand. For instance, if minimizing false negatives is crucial, then recall might be more important than other metrics.
