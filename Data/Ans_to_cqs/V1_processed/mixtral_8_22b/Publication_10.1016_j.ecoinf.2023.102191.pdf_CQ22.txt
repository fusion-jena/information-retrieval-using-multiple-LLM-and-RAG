The text does not provide information about the evaluation metrics used for the deep learning model. However, common metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of total predictions made. Precision is the ratio of true positive predictions to the sum of true positives and false positives. Recall is the ratio of true positive predictions to the sum of true positives and false negatives. F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. AUROC is a measure of how well a binary classifier separates positive and negative classes.
