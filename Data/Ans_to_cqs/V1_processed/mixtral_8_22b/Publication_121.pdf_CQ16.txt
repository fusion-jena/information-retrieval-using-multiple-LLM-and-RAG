The text does not explicitly state the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it can be inferred that the models were trained for a fixed number of epochs, ranging from 10 to 100. Additionally, the performance of the models was evaluated by calculating accuracies and losses of training samples in each epoch. This suggests that the authors might have monitored the training and validation accuracy and loss during the training process to decide when to stop training. A common practice is to stop training when the validation loss stops decreasing or starts increasing, indicating overfitting. However, without explicit information about the stopping criterion, this remains speculative.
