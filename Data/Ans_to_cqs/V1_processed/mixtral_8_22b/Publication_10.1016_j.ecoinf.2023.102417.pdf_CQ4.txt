The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Data augmentation techniques mentioned in general include flipping, rotating, scaling, changing brightness, contrast, and resolution. However, these techniques are not explicitly stated as being used in the described methodology. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, I cannot give a definitive list of data augmentation techniques applied in their deep learning pipeline.
