The proposed framework utilizes an Attention-Based One Dimensional Encoder Gated Recurrent Unit (AODEGRU) model, which is a variant of the recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture. Specifically, it employs gated recurrent units (GRUs) with one-dimensional encoding and integrates an attention mechanism to improve the model's ability to focus on relevant features when making predictions. This approach addresses some of the challenges faced by traditional deep learning models in the context of water pollution analysis in aquaculture, such as data variability, interpretability, and performance.
