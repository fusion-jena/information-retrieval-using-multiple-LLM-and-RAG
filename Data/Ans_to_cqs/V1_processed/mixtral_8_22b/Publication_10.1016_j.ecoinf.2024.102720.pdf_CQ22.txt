Based on the given context, it appears that the text discusses the use of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) for analyzing the drivers of per capita carbon emissions factors (CEFs). However, there is no information about the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model such as accuracy, precision, or recall. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to the query based on the given context.
