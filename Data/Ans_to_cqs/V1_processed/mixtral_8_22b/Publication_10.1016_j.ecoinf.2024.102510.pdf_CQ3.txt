The text does not provide explicit information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that some studies follow the Fine-Grained Image Classification (FGIC) methods and use the Mask Convolutional Neural Network (M-CNN) and attention guided data augmentation to categorize birds at a detailed level using bounding boxes and part annotations. This suggests that bounding box annotation and possibly instance segmentation might be among the data annotation techniques used in those studies. Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangles around objects of interest in images, while instance segmentation is a technique where each pixel in an image is assigned a label corresponding to an object or background category. These techniques help train deep learning models to recognize and localize objects accurately.
