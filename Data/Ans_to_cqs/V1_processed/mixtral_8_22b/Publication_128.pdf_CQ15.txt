The text does not explicitly mention any specific optimization technique such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, RMSprop, etc. However, there are some optimization strategies mentioned in the given context.

Firstly, the use of batch normalization before training helps in reducing internal covariance shift, leading to faster convergence and improved performance. Secondly, the application of Leaky ReLU as an activation function can help prevent the dying neuron problem, where certain neurons stop responding to variations in error during backpropagation. Lastly, the adjustment of learning rates and dropout rates to 0.001 could also be considered as part of optimization strategy, helping to control the step size while navigating through the loss landscape and preventing overfitting, respectively.

However, without explicit mention of optimization algorithms like SGD, Adam, or others, we cannot definitively state what optimization techniques are being used in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
