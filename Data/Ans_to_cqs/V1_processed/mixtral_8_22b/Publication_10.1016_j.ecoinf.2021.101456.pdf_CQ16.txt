Based on the provided context, there isn't explicit information regarding the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the dynamic β-VAE model. However, some insights can be derived from the description of the model's behavior during training.

One possible criterion could be related to the stabilization of the β parameter, which controls the balance between the reconstruction and regularization losses. As mentioned in the context, the value of β increases until around epoch 700, where it plateaus and eventually decreases before stabilizing at epoch 2000. This suggests that the model might consider training complete once the β parameter reaches a stable state.

Moreover, the context describes how the changes in β correlate with changes in the reconstruction and regularization losses, estimated according to Eqs. (5)-(8). Therefore, another potential criterion for determining the completion of training could involve monitoring the convergence or stabilization of these losses.

However, it should be noted that these interpretations are speculative, as the context does not explicitly mention any specific criteria for deciding when training is complete. To obtain a definitive answer, additional information would be required.
