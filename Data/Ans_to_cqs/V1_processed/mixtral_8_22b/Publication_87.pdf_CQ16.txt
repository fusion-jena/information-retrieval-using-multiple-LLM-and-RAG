The code snippets provided do not explicitly show the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, based on common practices in deep learning, some possible criteria include reaching a certain number of epochs or iterations, achieving a desired level of performance on the validation set (such as minimizing validation loss), or observing no further improvement in validation accuracy over several epochs (also known as early stopping). In this case, the code shows that the model was trained for 2 epochs using fit\_one\_cycle function from fastai library, which suggests that the criterion used might be simply completing a fixed number of epochs.
