Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention any specific dataset such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, the context provides several references related to satellite imagery and remote sensing data, which suggests that these types of datasets might be utilized in the deep learning pipeline. For instance, there is a reference to Sentinel-2 data, which is a European Space Agency mission providing high-resolution optical imagery for various applications including land cover mapping and agriculture monitoring. Additionally, there are mentions of using Landsat-8 OLI data, UAV visible light images, and other sources of remote sensing data. Therefore, while the exact datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not specified, it can be inferred that they likely involve some form of satellite or remote sensing data.
