The given context does not provide information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. It only mentions that the 'neuralnet' package of R 4.1.2 software was considered for developing a Backpropagation Artificial Neural Network (BP-ANN) model. However, without further details regarding the computational environment or system configuration, we cannot determine which hardware resources were utilized for training the deep learning model.
