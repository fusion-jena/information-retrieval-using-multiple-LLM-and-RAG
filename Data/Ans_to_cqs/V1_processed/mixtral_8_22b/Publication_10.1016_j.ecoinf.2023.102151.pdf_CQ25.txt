Based on the given context, it appears there are several papers discussing different aspects of soil science, including digital soil mapping, visualization of subsurface soil properties, river analysis and mapping, and soil moisture estimation using machine learning methods. However, none of them explicitly mention the use of a deep learning model or its specific purpose. Therefore, it would not be possible to determine the exact purpose of any potential deep learning models used in these studies without further information.

That being said, generally speaking, deep learning models can serve various purposes depending on the problem they aim to solve. These include but are not limited to image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, natural language processing tasks like sentiment analysis or translation, speech recognition, etc. In the context of soil science, deep learning could potentially be applied to classify soil types, detect anomalies in soil samples, segment images of soil profiles, predict soil properties from remote sensing data, among other applications.
