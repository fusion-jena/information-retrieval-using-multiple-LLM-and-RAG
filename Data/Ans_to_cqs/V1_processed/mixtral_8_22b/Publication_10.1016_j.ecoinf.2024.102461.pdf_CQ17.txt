Regularization methods are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, resulting in poor generalization performance on unseen data. Two popular regularization methods are Dropout and L2 Regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent complex co-adaptations on training data. This forces the network to distribute its weights more evenly, reducing overfitting. During testing, all neurons are included but their outputs are scaled down proportionately to the number of dropped out neurons during training.

L2 Regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. This encourages smaller weights, making the model simpler and less likely to overfit. It can be implemented by adding a factor multiplied by the sum of squares of all weights to the cost function.

Other regularization methods include L1 Regularization, Early Stopping, and Data Augmentation. L1 Regularization adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute value of the weights, encouraging sparse solutions. Early Stopping stops training once validation error starts increasing, preventing overfitting due to excessive training. Data Augmentation generates additional training samples by applying transformations like rotation or scaling, helping the model generalize better.
