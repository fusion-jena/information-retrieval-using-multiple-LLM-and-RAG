The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves setting aside a portion of the dataset for validation purposes. Specifically, 80% of the 4000 images for each category are used for training, while the remaining 20% are reserved for validation. This allows for continuous monitoring of the model's performance throughout the training process. Additionally, the evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F-measure are likely being tracked to assess the model's effectiveness. Furthermore, the use of IoU (Intersection over Union) as a threshold for determining positive or negative detections indicates that the model's ability to accurately localize objects within the image is also being monitored.
