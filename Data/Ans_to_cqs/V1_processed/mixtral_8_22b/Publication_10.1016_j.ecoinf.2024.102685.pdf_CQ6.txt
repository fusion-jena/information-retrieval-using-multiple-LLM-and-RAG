Based on the given context, it does not provide specific information regarding the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does mention some preprocessing steps related to the data used for setting up Random Forest (RF) models. These include removing points not falling within the region of interest (ROI) and removing mixed points where the co-occurrence of multiple species was recorded. Additionally, the context mentions that every decision tree in the implemented RF algorithm is trained with a bootstrapped sample of the training data. Therefore, based on this context, we can infer that preprocessing steps may involve filtering out irrelevant or redundant data and preparing the dataset for training purposes. However, these steps might differ depending on the type of data and the specific requirements of the deep learning model being used.
