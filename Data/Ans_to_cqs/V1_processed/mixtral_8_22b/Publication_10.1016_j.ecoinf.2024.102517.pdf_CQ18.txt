The text does not provide explicit information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it can be inferred that the authors might have been using some form of validation or testing data to evaluate the performance of their model during training. This is a common practice in machine learning where a portion of the available data is held out as validation or testing data to measure how well the model generalizes to unseen data. In this case, the authors mention having a clean bird sound test set containing 68 randomly selected segments, which could potentially serve as the validation or testing data for monitoring the model performance during training. Additionally, they discuss updating the phase of the model according to the backpropagation of the loss value, indicating that they likely tracked the loss function over epochs to ensure the model was improving and not overfitting.
