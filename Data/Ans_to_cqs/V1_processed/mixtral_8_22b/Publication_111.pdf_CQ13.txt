The text does not provide specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model such as learning rate or optimizer. However, it mentions that the optimal model hyperparameters were found using the Tree Parzen Estimator (TPE) method in the Hyperopt package. Additionally, it states that the GRU-DNN model was trained with lag features using K previous observations, where K is considered a hyperparameter that needs to be optimized. A grid search method was employed to find the optimal K value. Therefore, while the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are not specified, it is clear that hyperparameter optimization played a significant role in developing the model.
