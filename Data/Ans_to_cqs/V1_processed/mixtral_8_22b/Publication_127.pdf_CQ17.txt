Regularization methods are techniques used to prevent overfitting in deep learning models. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the noise or random fluctuations in the training data instead of the underlying patterns, leading to poor generalization to new data. Two common regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline are dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to prevent complex co-adaptations between neurons. By ignoring some neurons, the model becomes less sensitive to any single input feature and thus reduces overfitting. Dropout is typically applied to fully connected layers but can also be used in convolutional and recurrent layers.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function based on the sum of squared weights. This encourages smaller weights, making the model simpler and reducing its capacity to fit noise in the training data. L2 regularization is often used in combination with other regularization techniques such as early stopping and data augmentation.

Other regularization methods include L1 regularization, which penalizes the absolute value of the weights, and max norm constraints, which limit the maximum size of the weights. Additionally, batch normalization, which standardizes the inputs to each layer, can help reduce overfitting by improving the stability of the optimization process.

In summary, regularization methods such as dropout and L2 regularization are essential tools for preventing overfitting in deep learning pipelines. These techniques help to improve the generalization of models to new data by limiting their complexity and sensitivity to individual input features.
