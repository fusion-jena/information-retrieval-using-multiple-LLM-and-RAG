Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be applied to the input data to ensure better performance and faster convergence. These may include:

1. Normalization: Scaling pixel values between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1 helps maintain consistent scales across different features and accelerates optimization algorithms like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). In this case, the authors mention setting the input image size to 512 x 512, which could also be considered part of the preprocessing step.

2. Cleaning: Removing noise, irrelevant data points, or outliers from the dataset improves the overall quality of the input data and prevents overfitting. Although it isn't explicitly mentioned in the given text, cleaning might have been performed while preparing the dataset.

3. Augmentation: Techniques like scaling, panning, rotation, color transformation, and mosaic are used to increase the number of training samples and enhance the model's generalization abilities. The authors specifically state employing these data augmentation techniques to achieve this goal.

4. Splitting datasets: Dividing the available data into separate subsets for training, validation, and testing purposes allows for accurate assessment of the model's performance. Here, the authors split their dataset into 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing.
