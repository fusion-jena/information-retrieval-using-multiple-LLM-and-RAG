The text does not provide explicit information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, we can infer from the given context that the model was likely serialized after training due to its use in subsequent stages. This is evident from the mention of the model weights file size being significantly reduced, which suggests that the model was saved or serialized post-training. As for platform selection, no specific details were mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the exact process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
