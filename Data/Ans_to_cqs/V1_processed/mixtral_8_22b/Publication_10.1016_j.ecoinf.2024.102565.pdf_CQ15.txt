The given context does not provide information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which optimization techniques were applied, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). Please refer to additional sources or consult the original research paper for more detailed information regarding the optimization techniques used in their deep learning pipeline.
