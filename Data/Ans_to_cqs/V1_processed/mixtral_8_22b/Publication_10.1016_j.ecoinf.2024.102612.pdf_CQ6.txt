The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, based on general practices in machine learning and deep learning, common preprocessing techniques include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and augmenting the data. Normalization scales numeric columns to a standard scale without distorting differences in the ranges of values or losing information. Scaling rescales the values into a certain range, often between zero and one. Cleaning involves handling missing values, outliers, and errors in the dataset. Data augmentation generates new instances of data by applying transformations like rotations, translations, flips, etc., to increase the size of the dataset and improve the robustness of the model. These preprocessing steps help in improving the quality of the data, reducing computational complexity, and enhancing the overall performance of the deep learning model.
