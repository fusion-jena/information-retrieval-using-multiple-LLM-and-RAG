The given context does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in any deep learning model. However, it discusses the use of various machine learning algorithms such as LightGBM, RF, AdaBoost, and XGBoost in generating prediction results. These algorithms have their own set of parameters or hyperparameters that can be tuned to achieve better performance. For instance, LightGBM has hyperparameters like 'num_leaves', 'learning_rate', 'n_estimators', etc. Similarly, Random Forest (RF) has hyperparameters like 'n_estimators','max_depth','min_samples_split', etc. However, without explicit mention of these hyperparameters in the given context, we cannot determine which ones were specifically used in this study.
