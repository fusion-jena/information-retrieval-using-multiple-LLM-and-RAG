The convolutional neural network (CNN) is built using the Keras and TensorFlow software packages implemented in Python. These frameworks provide tools for building and training deep learning models, including CNNs. In addition, computation was performed using CUDA version 9.1 and CuDNN with Nvidia P100 accelerator cards with 12 GB of GPU memory. This setup allows for efficient processing of large datasets and complex computations required for deep learning tasks.
