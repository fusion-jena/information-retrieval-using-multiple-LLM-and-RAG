During the training process, the authors used a technique called cross-validation to evaluate the performance of their model. Cross-validation involves splitting the data into multiple sets, where one set is used for testing while the others are used for training. This allows the authors to assess how well their model generalizes to new data. Additionally, the authors monitored the loss function during training to ensure that the model was improving. They also used techniques like early stopping to prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data. Overall, the authors took several steps to ensure that their model was performing well during training and would be able to accurately detect and classify insect pests in real-world scenarios.
