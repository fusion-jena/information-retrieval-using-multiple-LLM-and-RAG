Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it can be inferred that the authors have used a publicly available dataset named Animal2-v1 from Roboflow (Roboflow Dataset, n.d.). Therefore, one could potentially access this dataset through the Roboflow platform. It should be noted that the specific version or link to the dataset was not mentioned in the provided context. Additionally, the authors did not explicitly state whether they made their own dataset available in any public repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Thus, without further clarification or additional information, it cannot be definitively stated where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
