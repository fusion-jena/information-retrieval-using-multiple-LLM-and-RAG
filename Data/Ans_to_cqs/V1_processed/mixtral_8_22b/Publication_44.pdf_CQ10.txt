Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide the exact code repository link of the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context. It would require additional resources or direct access to the project documentation to find out the specific code repository link. However, it is common practice to share open source projects on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I recommend searching these platforms using relevant keywords such as 'herbarium', 'deep learning','semantic segmentation', or 'Deeplabv3+' along with the authors' names if known.
