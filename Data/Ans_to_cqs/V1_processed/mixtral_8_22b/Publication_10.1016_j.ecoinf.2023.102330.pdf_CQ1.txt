The method utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is through the deployment of autonomous recording units (ARUs) in the field. These devices are capable of continuously recording audio data, which can later be processed and analyzed using various techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Additionally, there are platforms available, such as OpenSoundscape, that allow users to develop their own custom CNNs for species detection and identification from their field-collected acoustic data. Other methods mentioned include human observer point counts, but these have been noted to have high labor costs and limit the amount of data that can be collected.
