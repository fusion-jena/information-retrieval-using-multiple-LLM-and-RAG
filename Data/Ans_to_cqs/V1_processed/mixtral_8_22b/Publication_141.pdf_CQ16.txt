The text does not provide explicit information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, it can be inferred from the context that the accuracy of the model on both the training and validation sets is a significant factor in determining the completion of training. In particular, the high accuracy rates achieved during the first phase of training, where only the fully connected layer was trained, suggest that the model's performance on the validation set played a crucial role in deciding whether to proceed to the next phase of training or not. Additionally, the fact that the results further improved when fine-tuning was applied in the second training phase indicates that the model's ability to generalize to new data was also considered when evaluating its readiness for deployment. Therefore, while the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete may vary depending on the specific application and requirements, it is clear that factors such as accuracy, generalization performance, and the ability to learn task-specific features are essential considerations.
