After the model training, there are several postprocessing steps that can be taken depending on the specific requirements of the project. Some common postprocessing steps include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, and creating confusion matrices.

In this case, the text provides information about two postprocessing steps: clustering the freshness data and evaluating the clustering results. These steps occur after the model has been trained to predict the freshness of different species of fish.

Firstly, the data is clustered using a clustering method to determine the freshness class based on the dataset. This step involves partitioning the data into groups based on inherent characteristics, without requiring any external information or labels. The goal is to create groups that align naturally with the data conditions and the clustering algorithm.

Secondly, the clustering results are evaluated internally using Silhouette and Calinski-Harabasz methods. High evaluation scores on both methods indicate that the clustering results obtained by the clustering method are the best possible outcome. Additionally, the elbow method is used to experiment with the number and range of freshness classes using a clustering approach. This helps to minimize subjectivity and enhance the objectivity of the findings.

Overall, these postprocessing steps help to ensure that the model predictions are accurate and reliable, providing valuable insights into the freshness of different species of fish.
