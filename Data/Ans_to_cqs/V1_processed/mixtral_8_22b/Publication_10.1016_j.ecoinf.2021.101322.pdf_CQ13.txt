Unfortunately, the table containing the hyperparameter configurations for the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models mentioned in the text is not included in the provided information. However, I can tell you that during training, they used mini-batch gradient descent. Additionally, the implementation of the CNN was done using the Keras and TensorFlow software packages in Python, utilizing CUDA version 9.1 and CuDNN with Nvidia P100 accelerator cards with 12GB of GPU memory. They also employed a Keras implementation of EfficientNet-B4 known as EfficientNet V1.1.0 for their work. Pre-trained weights for transfer learning were accessible via the provided API.
