Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it can be inferred that the overall accuracy, producer's accuracy, and user's accuracy might play a role in evaluating the performance of the model during training. These metrics are mentioned in Table 3, but no threshold or target values are specified.

In general, common criteria used to determine when training is complete include reaching a certain number of epochs, achieving a desired level of accuracy, observing a plateau in validation loss, or meeting other predefined stopping conditions. Without more specific details regarding the training process, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer based solely on the given context.
