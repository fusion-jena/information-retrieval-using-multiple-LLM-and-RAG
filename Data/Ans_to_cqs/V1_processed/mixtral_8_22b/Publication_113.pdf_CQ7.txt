The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it is common practice in machine learning to divide the dataset into three subsets: training set, validation set, and testing set. Typically, the training set is used to fit the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final performance of the model. The proportion of each subset varies depending on the size of the dataset and the specific requirements of the task. Common splits include 70/15/15%, 80/10/10%, or even 90/5/5%. It is important to note that the splitting should be done randomly to ensure that the distribution of classes remains balanced across all subsets.
