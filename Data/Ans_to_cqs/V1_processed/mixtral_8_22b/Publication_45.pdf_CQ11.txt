The context does not explicitly mention the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline used for predicting bark beetle outbreaks. However, it mentions that the dataset used in this study is available online (Seidl et al., 2015). To find the specific data repository link, one would need to refer to the cited paper by Seidl et al. (2015) or contact the authors directly for more information.
