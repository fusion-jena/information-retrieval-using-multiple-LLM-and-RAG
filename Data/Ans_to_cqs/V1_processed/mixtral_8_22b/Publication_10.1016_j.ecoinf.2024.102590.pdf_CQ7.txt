In this case, the authors did not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to split their dataset for training, testing, or validation purposes. However, they mentioned that they used the vegetation types described by Gertenbach (1983) to guide the placement of their sampling plots, from which they collected training and validation points. They also stated that they divided their training point features into two cover classes: 'non-woody' (LC property = 1) and 'woody' (LC property = 2). Therefore, it can be inferred that the authors likely used these vegetation types and cover classes as criteria to split their dataset for training and validation purposes. Additionally, since they used a supervised learning approach, it is reasonable to assume that they reserved some portion of their dataset for testing purposes as well. However, without more explicit information about the exact proportions or methods used to split the dataset, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer.
