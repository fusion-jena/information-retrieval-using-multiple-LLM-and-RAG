Based on the given context, it appears that the study focuses on addressing challenges related to the processing of high-resolution remote sensing data, including issues with data redundancy and the impact of training sample size on classification accuracy. However, the context does not explicitly mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing in this particular study.
