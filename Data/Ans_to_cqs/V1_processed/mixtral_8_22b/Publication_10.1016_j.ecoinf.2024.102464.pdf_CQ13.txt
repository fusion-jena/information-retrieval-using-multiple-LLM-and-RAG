The given context does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. However, some common hyperparameters used in deep learning include learning rate, optimizer, batch size, number of epochs, and regularization parameters such as L1 or L2 regularization coefficients. These hyperparameters need to be tuned based on the problem and dataset being considered. In general, the learning rate controls how much the weights are updated during backpropagation, the optimizer determines the optimization algorithm used for updating the weights, the batch size specifies the number of samples processed before the model updates its internal parameters, the number of epochs defines the total number of iterations through the entire dataset, and regularization helps prevent overfitting by adding penalties to the loss function. Without further details about the specific deep learning model used in the study, it is impossible to determine which hyperparameters were used and what their respective values were.
