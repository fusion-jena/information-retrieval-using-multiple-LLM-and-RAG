The authors built their own dataset instead of using existing ones like Fish4Knowledge. They used three independent fish images datasets from the Mayotte Island (Western Indian Ocean) to train and test their Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and their post-processing method. These datasets consisted of fish images extracted from 175 underwater high-definition videos, lasting between 5 and 21 minutes for a total of 83 hours. The videos were recorded in 1920 x 1080 pixels with GoPro Hero 3+ Black and Hero 4+ Black cameras. The videos were recorded between 2 and 30 meters deep, with varying luminosity, transparency, and benthic environment conditions on fringing and barrier reefs.
