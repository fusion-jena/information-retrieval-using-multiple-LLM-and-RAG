The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, two types of CNN models are mentioned - VGG19 and ResNet50. These models are used for image classification tasks, where they take in multi-spectral satellite imagery and output land cover classes. The use of these models is evident in various parts of the text, such as the discussion about the performance of different datasets on these models and the description of the overall study process.
