The text does not provide explicit information about specific preprocessing steps used before training a deep learning model. However, common practices often involve several preprocessing techniques depending on the nature of the dataset. Normalization can be applied to scale pixel values between 0 and 1 or use mean subtraction and division by standard deviation to ensure consistent input ranges. Scaling may include resizing images to fit network architecture requirements. Cleaning could refer to removing noise, irrelevant objects, or artifacts from images. Data augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, zooming, or cropping might also be employed to increase the size and variety of the training dataset. It should be noted that these preprocessing steps are not mentioned explicitly in the given context, so they cannot be confirmed without further information.
