The given context does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, based on general knowledge about machine learning pipelines, these techniques can be applied during the preprocessing stage of the pipeline. Data annotation is crucial for training supervised machine learning models, including those using deep learning algorithms. Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangles around objects within images to identify their location, while instance segmentation goes further by outlining each object individually. Other common data annotation techniques include semantic segmentation, landmark annotation, and polygon annotation. These methods help create labeled datasets that enable machine learning models to learn patterns and make accurate predictions.
