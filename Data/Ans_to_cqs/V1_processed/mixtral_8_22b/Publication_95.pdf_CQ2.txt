Based on the given context, the data format used in this deep learning pipeline is images. This is evident from several mentions throughout the text, such as references to image resolutions, image channels, and cropping images. Additionally, the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), specifically ResNet50-v2 and MobileNet-v2, which are popular architectures for image classification tasks, further supports this conclusion. There is no mention of any other data formats like audio, video, or CSV files in the provided context.
