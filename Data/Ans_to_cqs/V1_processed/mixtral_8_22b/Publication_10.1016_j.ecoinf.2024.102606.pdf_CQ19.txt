The text does not explicitly mention which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model. However, it mentions two different versions of Faster R-CNN, which is a popular deep learning model for object detection. Faster R-CNN is typically implemented using deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, it can be inferred that one of these libraries might have been used to implement the Faster R-CNN models mentioned in the text.
