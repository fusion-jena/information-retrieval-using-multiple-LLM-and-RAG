The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is for classification tasks. Specifically, the model is designed to identify and classify different types of leaves. This is evident from several parts of the text, such as when it mentions adding a "top classifier softmax layer" for predicting the class for an input image, which indicates that the model is intended for classification purposes. Additionally, the mention of dividing the dataset into a training set and a test set further supports this conclusion, as this is a common practice in supervised machine learning tasks like classification.
