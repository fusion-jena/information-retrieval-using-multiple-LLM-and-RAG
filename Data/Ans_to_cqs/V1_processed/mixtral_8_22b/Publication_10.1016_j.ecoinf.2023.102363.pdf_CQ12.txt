The deep learning model used in the pipeline is based on the EfficientNet B0 network, which is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture developed by Tan and Le (2019). This network was originally trained for generic image classification but was adapted for the specific task of classifying Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) data frames into specified sound source classes. The EfficientNet B0 network uses transfer learning, where the feature extraction layers are frozen, and only the weights of the final dense classification layers are updated during training. The audio data is input to the network in a novel spectrogram representation, and the networks pre-trained on image data have been shown to perform well on classification tasks using spectrograms as image input.
