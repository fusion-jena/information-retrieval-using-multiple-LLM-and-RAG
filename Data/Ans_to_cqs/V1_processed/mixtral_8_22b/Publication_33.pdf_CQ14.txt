The text does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, such as through methods like grid search or random search. However, there is mention of a two-phase process involving building a classification model by training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on a given database T0, followed by tuning a risk threshold Ï„i specific to each class using a second and independent database T1. This suggests that some form of optimization was performed during these phases, but the exact method remains unspecified based on the available information.
