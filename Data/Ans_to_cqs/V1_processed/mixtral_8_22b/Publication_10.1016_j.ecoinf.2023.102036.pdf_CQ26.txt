The provided context does not explicitly mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it does indicate that the authors use existing deep learning techniques in combination with statistical fundamentals to overcome limitations in dataset size. While this may suggest some form of addressing data imbalance, it does not directly refer to any of the mentioned techniques. Therefore, without further information, it cannot be definitively stated what techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline in this case.
