The given context does not provide information about the use of any specific deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers in the pipeline. Instead, it discusses the application of various machine learning algorithms like Random Forest (RF), Adaboost, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), LightGBM, and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) for generating predictions and classifications. These methods do not belong to the category of deep learning models but rather fall under traditional machine learning techniques. Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot determine which type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline.
