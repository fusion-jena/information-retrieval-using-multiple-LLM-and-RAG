The text does not provide information about which specific hardware resources were used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. However, it mentions that an Intel® Core™ i7-1165G7 CPU and 32 GB of RAM were used for computations. This suggests that the computational tasks might have been performed using CPUs rather than specialized hardware like GPUs or TPUs.
