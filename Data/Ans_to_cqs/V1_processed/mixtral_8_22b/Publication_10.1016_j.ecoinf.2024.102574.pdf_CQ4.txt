The papers mentioned do not provide specific information about the data augmentation techniques used in their respective deep learning pipelines. However, common data augmentation techniques applied in deep learning include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, translation, and noise injection. These techniques help improve model generalization and prevent overfitting by increasing the diversity of training data without collecting new samples. It is important to note that the choice of data augmentation technique depends on the nature of the problem and the dataset being used.
