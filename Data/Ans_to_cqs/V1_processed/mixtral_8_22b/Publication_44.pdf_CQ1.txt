The given context does not provide explicit details about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general practices in machine learning and computer vision, some common ways to collect raw data include using sensors, conducting surveys or experiments, utilizing publicly available datasets, scraping websites, or even generating synthetic data through simulations. For instance, in the field of remote sensing, satellite imagery or drone footage could serve as raw data sources. In this case, we can infer that the input data might consist of images since the text discusses semantic segmentation, a technique often applied to visual data. Nevertheless, without more precise information, it would be speculative to pinpoint the exact method employed for gathering raw data in this particular scenario.
