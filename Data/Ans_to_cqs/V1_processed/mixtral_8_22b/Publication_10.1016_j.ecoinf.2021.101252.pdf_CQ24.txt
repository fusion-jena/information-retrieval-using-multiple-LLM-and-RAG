The text does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it mentions the use of AutoML procedures, which could potentially address some aspects of randomness. AutoML generates a set of candidate models with architectures and hyperparameters chosen randomly within a predefined range. After training each candidate model on a small subset of data, their performances are evaluated using a separate validation dataset. The best-performing model is then selected and trained further on the entire training dataset. While this process involves some level of randomness, it aims to find the most suitable architecture and hyperparameters for a given task through systematic exploration rather than relying solely on chance. Nevertheless, the management of random seeds specifically is not discussed in the provided context.
