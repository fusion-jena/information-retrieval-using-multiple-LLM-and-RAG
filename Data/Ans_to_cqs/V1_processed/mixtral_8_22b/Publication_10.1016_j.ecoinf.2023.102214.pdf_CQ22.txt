The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics such as precision, recall, and average precision (AP). Precision-Recall performance curves are calculated on a held-out test set to measure the model's accuracy. The Average Precision (AP), measured by the area under the curve, is a standard method for summarizing accuracy. For instance, the best-performing configuration with a non-maximum suppression (NMS) of 30% achieved an AP of 94.45%. Additionally, the paper mentions that if a detector is perfect, it would be represented by a colored dot closest to the upper right corner of the precision-recall coordinate system. Furthermore, if a fixed recall of 80% is required, the yellow diamond specifies the best possible accuracy across all possible configurations.
