The text does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, it mentions that the optimal cut-off thresholds are chosen based on the F-score, which suggests some form of optimization process is being employed. Unfortunately, without more specific details, I cannot definitively state whether this optimization involves techniques such as grid search or random search.
