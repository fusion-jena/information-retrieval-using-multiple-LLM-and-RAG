The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that some form of data annotation was employed due to the use of deep learning models such as U-Net, Pyramid Scene Parsing Network (Pspnet), and DeepLabV3+. These models are commonly used for tasks like image segmentation, which often require annotated datasets.

Data annotation techniques vary depending on the type of problem being solved. For example, bounding box annotation is typically used for object detection tasks where the goal is to identify the location of objects within an image. Instance segmentation, on the other hand, aims to classify each pixel in an image into different categories or instances.

Given that the context mentions these deep learning models being used to address geographical and ecological challenges, it is likely that some form of image segmentation was involved. Therefore, possible data annotation techniques could include polygon annotation, where shapes are drawn around objects of interest, or semantic segmentation, where every pixel in an image is assigned a label corresponding to its category.

However, without explicit information about the specific dataset and annotation process used, we cannot definitively state which data annotation technique was utilized in this case.
