The provided context does not directly discuss the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it is important to note that these preprocessing steps are often necessary when working with datasets to ensure optimal performance of the model. Normalization can help bring all features into the same range, which can be beneficial if the dataset has varying scales. Scaling can also adjust values measured at different scales to a common scale, while cleaning involves removing noise from the data. These techniques can improve the accuracy and efficiency of the model during training.
