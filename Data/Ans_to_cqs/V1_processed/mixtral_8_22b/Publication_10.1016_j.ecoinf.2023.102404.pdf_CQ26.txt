The text does not provide explicit information about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of a specific sampling technique called stratified random sampling. This method was employed to capture the full distribution of AGB values within the LiDAR-derived AGB maps accurately. By randomly selecting half of the pixels for the training and testing split, they ensured that the training/testing dataset accurately represented the distribution of AGB values within the LiDAR-derived AGB maps. This approach aimed to prevent any potential bias caused by uneven representation of AGB values in the dataset. Although not explicitly mentioned, this could be considered a strategy to mitigate data bias during preprocessing. Other common techniques to address data bias include oversampling, undersampling, diverse data collection, and data augmentation. These techniques help balance classes or improve the generalizability of models when dealing with imbalanced datasets or limited data availability.
