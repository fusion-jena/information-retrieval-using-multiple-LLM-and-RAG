The deep learning model used in the pipeline is called BirdNET-Analyzer. However, the specific type of deep learning architecture it uses, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers, is not explicitly stated in the given context. Therefore, based solely on the information provided, I cannot determine the exact type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
