After the model training, several postprocessing steps can be performed to further analyze and understand the model's performance. Some common postprocessing techniques include:

1. Saliency Maps: These visualize which parts of the input image were most important for the model's prediction. This helps identify whether the model is focusing on relevant features or being distracted by irrelevant ones.

2. Metrics Calculation: Various metrics like precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves, etc., can be calculated to quantify the model's performance. These metrics provide insights into how well the model performs across different classes and scenarios.

3. Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix is a table layout that allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm. Each row of the matrix represents the instances in an actual class while each column represents the instances in a predicted class. It gives us insight not only into the errors made by the classifier but more importantly the types of errors that are being made.

4. Cross-Validation: As mentioned in the given context, k-fold cross-validation is often employed to ensure that the model generalizes well to new data. This involves splitting the data into 'k' subsets, training the model on 'k-1' subsets, and testing it on the remaining subset. This process is repeated 'k' times so that each subset serves as the test set once.

5. Hyperparameter Tuning: After initial training, the model's hyperparameters might need adjustments to achieve optimal performance. Techniques like grid search or randomized search can be used to find the best combination of hyperparameters.

6. Model Interpretability: Post hoc interpretability methods like LIME, SHAP, etc., can be applied to explain individual predictions. This helps build trust in the model and ensures its decisions align with domain knowledge.
