Based on the given information, it appears that the study used a Windows 10 laptop with an Intel i7-11800H CPU and a GeForce RTX3080 GPU with 16GB of video memory to conduct their experiments. They utilized the PyCharm platform with Python 3.8 and the Pytorch 1.9 deep learning framework for training purposes. However, there is no explicit mention of a specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the monitoring strategy employed during the training process.
