Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available in the given context to provide a specific strategy for monitoring the model performance during training. The context primarily discusses various aspects related to coral reef dynamics, marine biology, and ecological studies, but does not explicitly mention any machine learning or statistical models being trained or their respective strategies for monitoring performance during training. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this query based on the given context.
