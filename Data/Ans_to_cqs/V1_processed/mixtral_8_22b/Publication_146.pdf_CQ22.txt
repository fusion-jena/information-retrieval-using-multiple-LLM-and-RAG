The deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F1 score. These metrics are used to measure the model's detection performance. Additionally, the model is also evaluated using Generalized Intersection over Union (GIoU) and mean Average Precision (mAP). The scores for these metrics are calculated based on the model validation data. During the training phase, the model achieved an accuracy score of F1=0.530 and mAP=0.557. The GIoU metric indicates that the model becomes better at correctly locating targets as it steadily decreases during training.
