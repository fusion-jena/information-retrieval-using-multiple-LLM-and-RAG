The provided context does not directly address the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it discusses the use of Word2Vec, a popular word embedding technique used in natural language processing tasks. In this case, the authors chose to use a pre-trained Word2Vec model instead of training a new one due to the need for a large dataset and increased computational efforts. While this decision doesn't specifically relate to handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it highlights the importance of choosing appropriate resources and methods when working with complex datasets and algorithms. To manage randomness in deep learning pipelines, some commonly used strategies include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, employing techniques like cross-validation, and utilizing ensemble methods to reduce variance caused by random initialization.
