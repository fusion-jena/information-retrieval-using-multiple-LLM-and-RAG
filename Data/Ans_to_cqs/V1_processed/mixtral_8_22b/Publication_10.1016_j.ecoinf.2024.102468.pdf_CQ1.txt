The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer that whale sound recordings are likely collected through underwater acoustic sensors or hydrophones deployed in marine environments. These devices capture sounds produced by various marine organisms, including whales, which can then be analyzed using deep learning techniques such as wavelet transform hidden Markov models (WT-HMM) and other machine learning detectors. Public datasets may also be available for research purposes, but this information is not directly stated in the given context.
