In the given context, the type of deep learning models used in the pipeline are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Specifically, the paper mentions using a CNN architecture without changing its internal parameters from the original proposal. Additionally, it discusses the use of other deep learning architectures such as ResNet (which is also a form of CNN), but does not mention any Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) or Transformers. Therefore, we can conclude that the primary type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is CNN.
