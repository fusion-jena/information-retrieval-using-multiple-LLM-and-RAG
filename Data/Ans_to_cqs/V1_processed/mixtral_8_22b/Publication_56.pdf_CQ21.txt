After the model training, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the project. However, some common postprocessing steps include:

1. Model Evaluation: This involves calculating various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., to evaluate the performance of the trained model. These metrics help in understanding how well the model has learned to classify the given dataset.

2. Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the predictions made by the model against the actual values. It provides insights into the types of errors made by the model and helps in identifying any patterns or trends in the misclassifications.

3. Saliency Maps: Saliency maps are visualizations that highlight the regions of an input image that contribute most significantly to the output prediction. They provide insights into the decision-making process of the model and help in interpreting the results.

In the context of the given problem statement, it is not explicitly mentioned what postprocessing steps were taken after the model training. However, considering the nature of the task, it can be assumed that some form of evaluation metrics would have been calculated to assess the performance of the trained model. Additionally, saliency maps could also have been generated to understand the important features contributing to the final classification result.
