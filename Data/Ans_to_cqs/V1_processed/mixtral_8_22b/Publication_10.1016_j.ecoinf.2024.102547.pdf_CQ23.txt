The given context does not provide specific details about any deep learning models used or developed, nor does it mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of such models. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the study involves analyzing large datasets characterized by functional attributes distributed across a spatial domain using various statistical methods, including dimension reduction techniques and supervised and unsupervised methods. These methods consider spatial dependencies within extensive datasets.

Functional data analysis (FDA) is mentioned as an alternative approach to handling diverse and heterogeneous datasets of functional, shape, or more complex structures. It appears that the researchers studied the relationships between the SSL spatial structuration and the pelagic environment to leverage all the available information in the data. They also referenced previous works that focused on aggregated features from the original data.

While the context does not explicitly discuss the use of deep learning models or measures taken to ensure their generalizability, common practices in machine learning and deep learning include using diverse datasets, employing cross-validation techniques, and performing stratified splitting to maintain class balance during training and validation processes. Without further context regarding the development or application of deep learning models, these assumptions cannot be confirmed.
