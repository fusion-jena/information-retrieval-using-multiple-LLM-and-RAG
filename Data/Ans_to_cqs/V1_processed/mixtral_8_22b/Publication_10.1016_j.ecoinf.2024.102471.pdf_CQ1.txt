The context does not provide explicit information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer some possible methods based on the given information. For instance, in the case of identifying bird species based on their vocalizations, the raw data could have been collected using a digital recorder and a unidirectional microphone. This suggests that recording devices or sensors might be employed for gathering audio data. Additionally, the mention of a dataset containing the vocalizations of 14 different bird species implies that publicly available datasets could also serve as sources of raw data. Nonetheless, without further details, it is challenging to definitively determine all the potential methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
