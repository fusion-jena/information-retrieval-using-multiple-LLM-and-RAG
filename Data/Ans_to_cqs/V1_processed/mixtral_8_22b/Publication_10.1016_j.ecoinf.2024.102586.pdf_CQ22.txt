The text does not provide information about the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it mentions that Random Forest (RF) models have been used due to their high level of predicted accuracy compared to other supervised learning techniques. This suggests that accuracy might be one of the metrics considered when evaluating the performance of the model. Additionally, the text discusses the calculation of variable importance scores based on the change in prediction error, which could indicate that error rate or similar measures may also be relevant in assessing the model's performance.
