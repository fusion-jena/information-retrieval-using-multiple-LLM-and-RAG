The paper does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning models such as learning rate or optimizer. The only mentioned parameter selection method is based on the RMSEcv values. However, it is stated that Support Vector Machines (SVM) was performed in MATLAB R2016a, and the training model was established by using the libsvm package in MATLAB. Unfortunately, without further details, we cannot determine the exact hyperparameters used in this study.
