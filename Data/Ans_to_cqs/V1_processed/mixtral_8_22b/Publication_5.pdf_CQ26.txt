Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention or discussion about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it can be inferred from the text that some form of data preprocessing has been done before feeding the data into the deep learning model. For instance, the use of a grid search to find the optimal hyperparameters for the Random Forest model suggests that the dataset might have undergone some sort of partitioning or sampling. Nevertheless, without further information, it cannot be confirmed if this was specifically aimed at addressing data bias. It would be advisable to refer to other sources or consult domain experts for more accurate information regarding the application of these techniques in the context of deep learning pipelines.
