Unfortunately, based on the given context, there isn't enough information to provide a direct link to the deep learning pipeline's data repository. However, it can be inferred that some of the data used in this research might have been obtained from sources like the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) and the Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC). These centers are part of NASA's Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS), providing various datasets related to earth science.

For instance, the main data used in the study includes Aboveground Biomass Density (AGBD) at the scale of individual footprints (GEDI L4A) and the 1 km x 1 km gridded GEDI L4B AGBD, both from ORNL DAAC, and Relative Height (RH_99 of L2 A GEDI) from LP DAAC.

However, without more specific details about the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the query, I cannot provide a precise link to its data repository. It would be helpful if additional context were provided regarding the specific deep learning pipeline being referred to.
