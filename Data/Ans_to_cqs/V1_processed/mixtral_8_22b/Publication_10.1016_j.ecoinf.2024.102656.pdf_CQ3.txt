The given context does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangles around objects of interest within images or videos. Semantic segmentation is the process of classifying each pixel in an image into a category such as person, car, building, etc. Instance segmentation combines both object detection and semantic segmentation by identifying individual instances of objects within an image while also providing detailed outlines of their shapes. Other techniques may include polygon annotation, key point annotation, and text annotation depending on the application and requirements of the project.
