The study uses various data augmentation techniques to increase the size of its training dataset. These techniques involve applying random variations and manipulations to the existing data. Specifically, the following augmentations are described in Table 1:

1. Flipping: This technique involves flipping the image horizontally or vertically. It helps the model generalize better by creating new perspectives of the same image.

2. Cropping: This method involves removing parts of the image to focus more on the relevant details. It can help improve the performance of the model when dealing with different scales and sizes of the target objects.

3. Contrast shift: By changing the contrast of the image, the model becomes more robust to varying lighting conditions and color differences.

4. Translation: This technique shifts the position of the image within the frame, helping the model learn about spatial relationships and improving its ability to detect objects regardless of their location in the image.

5. Rotation: By rotating the image, the model gains experience with different orientations of the target objects, making it more versatile and accurate.

These augmentations are applied randomly to the training data, ensuring diversity and preventing overfitting. As mentioned in the text, there are five augmented images created per original tile, resulting in an additional 5735 tiles split between the two sites.
