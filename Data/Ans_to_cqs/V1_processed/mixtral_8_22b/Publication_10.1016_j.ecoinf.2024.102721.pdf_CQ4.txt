Based on the given context, it does not provide specific details about the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, and shifting. These techniques help increase the amount of training data and improve the generalization ability of models. It is important to note that the choice of data augmentation technique depends on the nature of the problem being solved and the characteristics of the dataset.

The article discusses forecasting ecological water demand using deep learning methods such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), but it does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques used in their deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful response to this query.
