The article discusses a fully automatic system for fish biomass estimation based on a deep neural network. However, it does not explicitly mention which specific type of deep learning model is used in their pipeline. It could be a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or another type like a Transformer. Without further details from the authors, we cannot definitively determine the exact type of deep learning model they employed.
