The paper does not provide explicit information on specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it mentions the use of ground-truth datasets consisting of annotated images for training deep learning models, which implies some form of data preparation and preprocessing. To ensure accurate and unbiased results, it is common practice to employ techniques like those mentioned in the query when preparing and preprocessing data for deep learning applications. Without additional context or information, it cannot be determined if any of these specific methods were employed in this particular study.
