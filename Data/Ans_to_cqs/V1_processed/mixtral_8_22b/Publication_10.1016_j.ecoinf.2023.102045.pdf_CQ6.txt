The preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include several techniques aimed at improving the quality and usability of the input data. These steps often involve data cleaning, where missing values, outliers, or irrelevant data points are removed or corrected. Normalization and scaling are also common preprocessing steps used to ensure that all input features have similar scales, preventing certain features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process. Other preprocessing methods include encoding categorical variables into numerical representations, feature extraction, and dimensionality reduction. However, it should be noted that these preprocessing steps depend on the specific requirements and characteristics of the dataset being used for training the deep learning model.
