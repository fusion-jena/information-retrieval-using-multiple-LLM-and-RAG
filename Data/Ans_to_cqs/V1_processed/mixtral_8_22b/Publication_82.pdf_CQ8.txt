The code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available on GitHub. You can find it at <https://github.com/salathegroup/plantvillage_deep>. This repository contains the implementation of the deep learning models used in this study, including both AlexNet and GoogLeNet architectures. It also includes scripts for preprocessing the datasets, training the models, and evaluating their performance. Additionally, more image data can be found at <https://www.plantvillage.org/en/plant_images>, which may be useful for further research or applications.
