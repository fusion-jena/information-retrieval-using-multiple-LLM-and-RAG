Unfortunately, based on the given context, there isn't enough information to determine the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (i.e., into train, test, and validation sets). However, it can be inferred that the authors collected and processed data using various environmental factors such as Respiration (RE), Net Solar Radiation (NSR), Air Temperature (TA), Wind Speed (WS), Relative Humidity (RH), and Precipitation (P) over a period of two years (December 2014 to November 2016). They utilized a significance level of 1% and considered lagged information (Ï„ = 1 to 12, i.e., 6 hours) during their network computation. It appears that they employed the Temporal Information Partitioning Network (TIPNet) method for their research. Nevertheless, without explicit details regarding the data splitting criteria for deep learning model training, one cannot provide a definitive answer.
