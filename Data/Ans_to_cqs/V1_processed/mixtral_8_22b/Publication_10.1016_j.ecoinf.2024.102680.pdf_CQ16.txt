Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it can be inferred from common machine learning practices that some possible criteria could include reaching a certain number of epochs or iterations, observing a plateau in the validation loss, or meeting a predefined threshold for a chosen metric such as accuracy or F1 score. In this case, since the text mentions validating the effectiveness of the Underwater Object Detection Network (UODN) using various object detection algorithms, it might imply that the training was considered complete once the desired performance metrics were met or surpassed. Nevertheless, without further details about the exact training process, it remains uncertain what precise criteria were employed to decide when the training should conclude.
