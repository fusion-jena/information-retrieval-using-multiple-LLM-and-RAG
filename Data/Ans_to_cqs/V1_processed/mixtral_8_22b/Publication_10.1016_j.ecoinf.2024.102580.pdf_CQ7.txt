The ground-truth dataset was divided randomly into training (80%), validation (10%), and test (10%) sets. This division of the imagery allowed for a good-sized validation and test dataset for evaluating the modelâ€™s accuracy, while maximizing the training set. Each image was subset and cropped into six overlapping patches matching the output size of the network (388 x 388 pixels). As a result, the total training set size was 379 images.
