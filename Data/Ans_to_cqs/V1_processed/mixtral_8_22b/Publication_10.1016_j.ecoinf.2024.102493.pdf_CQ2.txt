Based on the given information, it is not explicitly stated what specific data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline. However, some clues can be found regarding the data sources and their processing methods.

From section 2.2.1, it is known that the researchers utilized the MOD13A2 dataset from the GEE platform to acquire NDVI data. This dataset provides remote sensing products with a spatial resolution of 1 km and a temporal resolution of 16 days. It can be assumed that the data format used here might be raster or geospatial data since these datasets often come in such formats.

Additionally, in sections 2.2.2 and subsequent paragraphs, various drivers related to climate, terrain, and human activities are mentioned. Some examples include evaporation, temperature, elevation, population density, etc. These variables could potentially be represented in numerical or tabular formats like CSV files.

Furthermore, the text mentions the use of ArcGIS Pro 3.0.2 for projection transformations, mask extractions, and deriving slope and aspect data from DEM data. This suggests that vector or raster data formats may also be involved in the analysis process.

However, without explicit mention of the exact data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, one cannot definitively state the precise formats employed.
