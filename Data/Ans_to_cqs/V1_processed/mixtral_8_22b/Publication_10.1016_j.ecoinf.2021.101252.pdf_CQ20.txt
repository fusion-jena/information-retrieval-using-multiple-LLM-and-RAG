The text does not explicitly state which specific hardware resources were used for training the deep learning models. However, it mentions that 'typical' classification tasks can take several hours to run on a standard desktop computer. Additionally, it suggests that ecologists may need to use faster hardware such as GPUs, tensor processing units (TPUs), and large-resource cloud computing services to address the challenge of computational demand in deep learning. Therefore, while it cannot be definitively stated, it can be inferred that the deep learning models mentioned in the text could potentially have been trained using GPU or TPU resources.
