The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the given context is to create a high-resolution Canopy Height Model (CHM) of the Earth at a 10-meter resolution. This is achieved by utilizing Sentinel-2 optical images and applying a deep learning approach using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model was tested separately in various forest plots located in the northern Italian Alps and Germany, and then applied to all the plots through a cross-validation analysis. The goal of creating this high-resolution CHM is to assess biodiversity patterns in forest ecosystems by estimating the horizontal heterogeneity (HH) correlated to tree species diversity.
