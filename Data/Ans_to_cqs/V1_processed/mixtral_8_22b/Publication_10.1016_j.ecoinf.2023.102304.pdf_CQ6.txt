The provided context does not directly address the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does mention some aspects related to preparing data for modeling. For instance, it discusses the need for higher Multispectral (MS) resolution to better capture the index response to wildfires, which could imply image processing techniques like resizing or cropping. It also mentions the optimization of parameters for improved accuracy and Kappa values, suggesting the importance of parameter tuning during model development. Furthermore, it highlights the use of appropriate indices based on regional climate and vegetation cover conditions, indicating the relevance of feature selection or engineering in data preparation. Lastly, it refers to the verification of post-fire recovery using certain data, implying the necessity of data validation or quality checks prior to modeling. Nonetheless, without explicit information about normalization, scaling, or cleaning procedures, it cannot be definitively stated what preprocessing steps are specifically involved before training a deep learning model from this context.
