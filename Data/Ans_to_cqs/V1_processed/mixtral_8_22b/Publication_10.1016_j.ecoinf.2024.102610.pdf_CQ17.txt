The given context does not provide information about the use of specific regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization in a deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of two variable elimination techniques for preventing overfitting in a random forest model: Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Variable Selection Using Random Forests (VSURF). These techniques help improve the model's generalizability by removing unnecessary features from the dataset.

In RFE, the algorithm recursively removes one variable at a time while evaluating its impact on the model's performance. The process continues until the algorithm reaches the best predefined level of model performance. In this case, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is used as the termination condition. Any variables whose removal leads to a deterioration in the best RMSE value are retained.

On the other hand, VSURF follows a three-step procedure involving variable selection, ranking, and thresholding. It aims to identify important predictors and eliminate irrelevant ones, thus reducing the risk of overfitting.

While these techniques are not directly related to regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines, they serve a similar purpose â€“ improving the model's performance and avoiding overfitting. Regularization methods like dropout and L2 regularization work differently but have the same goal: enhancing the model's generalizability and preventing overfitting. Dropout randomly drops out neurons during training, effectively making the network smaller and more robust against noise. L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, discouraging large weights and promoting simpler models.
