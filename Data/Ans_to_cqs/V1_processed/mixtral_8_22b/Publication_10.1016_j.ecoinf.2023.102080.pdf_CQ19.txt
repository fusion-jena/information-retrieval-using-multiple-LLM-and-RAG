Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any specific deep learning framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch being used to build a deep learning model. The text primarily discusses the use of the 'covsel' R package for species distribution modeling, which involves steps like collinearity filtering and model-specific embedding. Therefore, it can be concluded that the provided context does not contain enough information to determine which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model.
