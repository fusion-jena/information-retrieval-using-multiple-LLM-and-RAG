Based on the given context, it appears that the data was split into a training dataset and a testing dataset using a 70/30 ratio. This means that 70% of the data was used for training the MaxEnt model, while the remaining 30% was used for testing its performance. However, there is no mention of a separate validation dataset being used. It seems that the maximum number of iterations was also specified when running the model with this particular setup. Additionally, the analysis involved examining various environmental and geographical factors such as temperature indices, precipitation indices, and slope. These factors were likely used as input features for the model.
