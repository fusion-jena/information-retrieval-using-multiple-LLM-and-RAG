Based on the given context, there is no information about the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context only mentions the use of the nine-cell approach for smoothing existing data inaccuracies within single grid cells, but does not provide details about any other data augmentation methods such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to the query based on the given context.
