The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training varies depending on the type of machine learning algorithm used. However, based on the given context, some common strategies can be identified.

For Random Forest (RF) models, a grid search methodology was employed to identify optimal values for RF parameters such as "ntree" and "mtry." Grid search is a hyperparameter optimization technique that systematically explores different combinations of hyperparameters to find the best performing set. This approach helps ensure that the model performs well during both training and testing phases.

Similarly, for eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models, key parameters such as "nrounds," "max depth," "min child weight," "gamma," and "subsample" were also optimized using a grid search methodology. Again, this ensures that the model is fine-tuned to perform well during training and testing.

Support Vector Regression (SVR) models require selecting the appropriate kernel function and optimizing the "C" parameter, which balances margin width and misclassification tolerance. While not explicitly mentioned in the context, cross-validation is often used to evaluate the performance of SVR models during training. Cross-validation involves splitting the data into multiple folds or sets, where one fold is held out for validation while the remaining folds are used for training. This process is repeated until all folds have been used for validation, providing a more robust estimation of the model's performance.

Overall, monitoring the model performance during training is crucial to ensuring that the final model generalizes well to new data. Common strategies include hyperparameter optimization techniques like grid search and cross-validation, which help prevent overfitting and improve the overall accuracy of the model.
