The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is image classification. Deep learning networks are utilized as non-linear functions with numerous parameters. These parameters are fine-tuned using annotated data, often referred to as a supervised approach. After the training process, the network's performance is evaluated by providing it with an unseen dataset, known as the testing data set. Deep learning techniques are widely applied across various fields and are regarded as the cutting edge for computer vision applications. In certain domains, these technologies are even believed to surpass human capabilities.
