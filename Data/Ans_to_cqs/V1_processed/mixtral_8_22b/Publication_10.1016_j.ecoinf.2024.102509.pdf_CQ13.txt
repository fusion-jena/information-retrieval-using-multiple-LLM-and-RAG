The text does not provide explicit information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the type of optimizer employed. However, it does mention that the Backpropagation Artificial Neural Network (BP-ANN) utilized has an input layer with 'n' covariates, two hidden layers containing 'p' hidden neurons each, and an output layer with one output neuron. The number of hidden layers and neurons were chosen through a trial-and-error process aimed at optimizing the network's structure. Additionally, the 'neuralnet' package of R 4.1.2 software was used for training multi-layer perceptrons in regression analysis. Unfortunately, without further details regarding the implementation of this model, we cannot determine the exact values of the learning rate, optimizer, or other potential hyperparameters used in this study.
