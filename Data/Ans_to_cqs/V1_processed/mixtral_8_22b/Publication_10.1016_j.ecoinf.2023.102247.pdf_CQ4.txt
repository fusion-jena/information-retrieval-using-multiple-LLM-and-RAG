The given context does not provide information on the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, some common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, and shifting. These techniques help increase the amount of training data available and improve the generalization ability of the model by introducing variations into the input images.

The paper uses an ensemble modeling approach in the BIOMOD2 package in R to predict the distribution of the study species. Four different models were employed, including regression-based and machine-learning models such as Maxent, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines. Cross-validation was used to test for model performance, with the Area Under the Receiving Operator Characteristics Curve being used as the index to specify the accuracy. However, there is no mention of any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
