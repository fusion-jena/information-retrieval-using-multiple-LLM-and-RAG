The given text does not provide explicit details about the specific hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the best performing model was selected based on the validation loss after training for 3000 iterations. It also states that a Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) threshold of 0.7 was used during testing. Unfortunately, there is no mention of other important hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, or the type of optimizer used.
