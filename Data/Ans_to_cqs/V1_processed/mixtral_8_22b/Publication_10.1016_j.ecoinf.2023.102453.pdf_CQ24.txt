Unfortunately, there is no explicit information given about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values, within the provided context. However, one strategy commonly employed to manage randomness in deep learning pipelines involves setting fixed seeds for various libraries, including NumPy and TensorFlow, before running experiments. This ensures reproducibility across different runs and enables researchers to compare results accurately. Additionally, some practitioners use deterministic algorithms instead of stochastic ones when possible, reducing the impact of randomness on outcomes. Lastly, employing multiple trials with different initializations and averaging results can help mitigate the effects of randomness on overall performance.
