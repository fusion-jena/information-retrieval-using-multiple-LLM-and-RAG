Unfortunately, there is no information available regarding the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model mentioned in the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide any details about the learning rate or optimizer used in this case. However, it is common practice to use various hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, optimizers like Adam, SGD, etc., depending upon the problem statement and dataset.
