Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information regarding the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the authors might have used publicly available datasets or satellite imagery data collected through remote sensing technology. In general, common methods for collecting raw data include surveys, various types of sensors, and accessing public datasets. Surveys involve gathering data directly from individuals or entities through questionnaires or interviews. Sensors can collect a wide range of data such as temperature, humidity, pressure, light intensity, etc. Public datasets are often made available by government agencies, research institutions, or private organizations for use in academic studies or commercial applications.
