Based on the given context, it is not explicitly mentioned how the raw data was collected for the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the information available that the study focuses on detecting water sun glint in UAV water images. Therefore, it is likely that the raw data was collected using unmanned aerial vehicles equipped with cameras or sensors capable of capturing high-quality images of water bodies. Additionally, the context mentions that the WSGD dataset was used for training and evaluating the Res_AUNet network, which suggests that this dataset may have been used as a source of raw data for the deep learning pipeline. However, without further information, it cannot be confirmed whether any additional sources of raw data were utilized in the study.
