Based on the given context, it is not explicitly mentioned what specific data annotation techniques were used in their deep learning pipeline. However, considering they developed a method for water sun glint detection in UAV water images, it can be inferred that some form of pixel-level or semantic segmentation annotation technique might have been employed. Semantic segmentation involves labeling every single pixel in an image with a corresponding class, which could help train a model like Res_AUNet to accurately detect and segment water sun glint areas from the rest of the image. Nevertheless, without explicit information about the data annotation techniques used, this remains speculative.
