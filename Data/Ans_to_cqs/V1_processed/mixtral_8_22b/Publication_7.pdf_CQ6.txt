Based on the given context, there isn't explicit mention of any specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that some form of data preparation was done since the authors utilized a pre-trained VGGnet and fine-tuned its weights using the Benthoz15 dataset. Additionally, they extracted activation vectors from the first fully connected layer of the VGGnet to serve as feature representations. These feature representations were then processed through spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) and Multi-scale Orderless Pooling (MOP) schemes, which could be considered part of the preprocessing step. Lastly, the resulting multi-scale deep features were used to train a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) network for classification. Therefore, while not explicitly stated, the preprocessing steps likely included extracting relevant features from the raw data and applying appropriate pooling techniques to prepare the data for training the deep learning model.
