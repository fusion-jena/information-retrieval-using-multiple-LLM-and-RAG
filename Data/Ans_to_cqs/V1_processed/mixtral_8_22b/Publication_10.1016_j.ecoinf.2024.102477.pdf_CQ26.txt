The provided context does not directly discuss specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it mentions that deep learning methods are being widely applied to create models directly from large volumes of complex data (Seng et al., 2021). These methods have superior performance for time-series prediction compared to many other models (Li et al., 2019b). The context also describes the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Stacked Long Short-Term Memory (SLSTM) models for time-series prediction tasks (Ma et al., 2015; Graves & Graves, 2012). To ensure fairness and accuracy in these models, addressing data bias during preprocessing is crucial. Techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection can help manage imbalanced datasets and reduce bias in predictions.
