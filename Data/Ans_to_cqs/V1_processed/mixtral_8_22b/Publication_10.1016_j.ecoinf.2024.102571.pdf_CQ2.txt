The given context does not provide information about the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine which specific data formats such as images, audio, video, or CSV files were utilized in this case.

Based on the available context, it appears that the research focuses on water pollution control, greenhouse gas emissions, and ecological informatics. The mentioned studies discuss various aspects like global nitrogen and phosphate levels in urban wastewater, CO2 peaks in China, and the decomposition of Ecological Informatics using the Log-Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) method. However, there is no mention of any particular data format used in these analyses.
