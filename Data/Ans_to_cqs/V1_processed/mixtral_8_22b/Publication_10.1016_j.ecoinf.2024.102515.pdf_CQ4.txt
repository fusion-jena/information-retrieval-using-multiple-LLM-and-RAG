Based on the given context, I am unable to provide a direct answer regarding the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotating, scaling, etc. However, I can infer that the authors might have employed similar techniques during the preprocessing stage of their analysis due to the nature of their work involving image data. Nevertheless, without explicit mention of these techniques in the provided context, I cannot confirm their usage.
