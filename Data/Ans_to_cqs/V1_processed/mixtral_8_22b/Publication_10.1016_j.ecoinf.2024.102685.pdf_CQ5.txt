The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, it can be inferred from the context that the study uses seasonal multispectral images from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper and 8 Operational Land Imager satellites to classify seagrass meadows in the Grado and Marano lagoon in Northeast Italy. These images were collected between 1999 and 2019. It appears that the authors use a random forest algorithm for the classification task. Unfortunately, there is no mention of any standard benchmark datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in this study.
