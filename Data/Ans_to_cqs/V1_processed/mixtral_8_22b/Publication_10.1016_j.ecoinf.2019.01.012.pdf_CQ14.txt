The text does not provide explicit information about the specific method used for hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search or random search. However, it mentions that the validation set is used during training for fine-tuning hyperparameters and model selection. This suggests that some form of iterative optimization process was employed to find the best combination of hyperparameters. Without more detailed information, it cannot be determined whether grid search, random search, or another method like Bayesian Optimization or Gradient-based Optimization was utilized.
