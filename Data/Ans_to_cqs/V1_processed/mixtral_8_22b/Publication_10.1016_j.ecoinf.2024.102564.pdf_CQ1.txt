The study utilizes various methods for collecting raw data in the machine learning pipeline. For instance, they collect soil samples for each plot to create a composite sample, obtaining information for different depths such as 0--20 cm and 20--40 cm. They then analyze these samples to determine factors like soil pH, exchangeable cations, total acidity, cation exchange capacity, base saturation, available phosphorus, phosphorus remaining in solution, and soil organic matter using standard methods. Additionally, they use spatial tools like the ArcGIS 10.3.1 program to calculate elevation, slope, and aspect for each plot, accounting for differences in topography by utilizing the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) for their analysis.
