The text does not provide specific details about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, generally speaking, common preprocessing steps for image datasets might include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization involves adjusting pixel values so they fall within a certain range, such as 0 to 1. Scaling refers to resizing images to fit the input size required by the deep learning model. Cleaning involves removing any irrelevant or corrupted data points from the dataset. These preprocessing steps help improve the performance and efficiency of the deep learning model during training.
