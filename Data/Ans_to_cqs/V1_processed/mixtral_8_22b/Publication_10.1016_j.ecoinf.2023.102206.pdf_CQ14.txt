The text does not provide explicit information on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, such as through methods like grid search or random search. However, it mentions that the value of the hyperparameter gamma (Î³) is experimentally chosen and kept constant at 10% for all experiments of IFTL. This suggests that some form of experimental optimization might have been used to determine the optimal value of this hyperparameter. Nonetheless, without further details about the specific methodology employed for hyperparameter tuning, it cannot be definitively stated whether techniques like grid search or random search were used.
