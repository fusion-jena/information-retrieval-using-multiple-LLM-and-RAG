The information provided does not explicitly state the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer that the study uses remote sensing data, specifically an imagery dataset obtained from the Pleiades-1B satellite. This dataset consists of multiple spectral bands, including blue, green, red, and near-infrared bands, with varying spatial resolutions. Additionally, the study mentions the use of the 'neuralnet' package of R 4.1.2 software, which is primarily employed for training multi-layer perceptrons in regression analyses. Based on these details, we can conclude that the deep learning pipeline likely involves processing and analyzing image data.
