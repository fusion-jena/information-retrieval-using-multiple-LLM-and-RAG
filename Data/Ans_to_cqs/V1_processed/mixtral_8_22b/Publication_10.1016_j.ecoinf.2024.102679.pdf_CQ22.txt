The text does not provide explicit information about the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it mentions selecting the model based on its performance on the validation set during each training stage. Common evaluation metrics for deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of total instances; precision indicates the ratio of true positive predictions to all predicted positives; recall shows the fraction of relevant instances retrieved from the data; and the F1 score combines both precision and recall into a single metric. Given these common practices, it can be assumed that similar metrics were likely employed to assess the model's performance.
