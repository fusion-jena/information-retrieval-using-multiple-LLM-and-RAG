The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves several steps. Firstly, the authors selected the best replicate based on the highest F-score achieved on the validation set. Secondly, they determined the optimal cut-off thresholds for the recognizer, choosing either the single value or the mean of identical F-scores. Thirdly, they ran a random forest model using the best replicate and threshold on the test set to evaluate its performance. Lastly, they applied the same recognizer and threshold to the target set to gather biologically relevant data. This approach ensures that the model's performance is continuously monitored throughout the training process, allowing for adjustments and improvements as needed.
