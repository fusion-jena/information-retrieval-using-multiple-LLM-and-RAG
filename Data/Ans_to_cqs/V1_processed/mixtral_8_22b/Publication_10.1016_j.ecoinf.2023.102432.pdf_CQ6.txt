The provided context does not directly discuss the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does mention some aspects related to preparing data for machine learning models. For instance, it talks about handling 'imperfect' data due to locational errors or mismatches between training locations and image pixels. It also mentions how MTMI-SMF handles this issue by grouping pixels surrounding a training location, rather than requiring a single pixel to represent a training location. This approach reduces the need for guesswork when developing a training dataset. Additionally, the text notes that MTMI-SMF is computationally efficient compared to many machine learning algorithms because it uses simple matrix multiplication. But again, these points do not directly address the specific preprocessing steps typically involved before training a deep learning model.
