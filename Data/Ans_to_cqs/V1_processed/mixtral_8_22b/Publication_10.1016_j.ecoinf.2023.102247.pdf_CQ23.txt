To ensure the generalizability of their ensemble modeling approach, the authors employed cross-validation by using 70% of the dataset as training data to build the models and the remaining 30% as testing data to calculate the models' accuracy. Cross-validation is a technique used to assess how well a statistical model will generalize to an independent dataset. By dividing the available data into subsets, such as training and testing sets, researchers can evaluate the model's ability to accurately predict new or unseen data. In this case, the Area Under the Receiving Operator Characteristics Curve (AUC) was used as the index to specify the accuracy of the models. A higher AUC value indicates that the model is more accurate. This process helps to prevent overfitting, which occurs when a model learns the details and noise in the training data to the extent that it negatively impacts its performance on new data.
