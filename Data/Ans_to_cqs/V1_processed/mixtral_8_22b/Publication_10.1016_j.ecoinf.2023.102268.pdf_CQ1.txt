Based on the given context, it does not provide explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer that the study involves analyzing underwater sounds, specifically oyster toadfish (Opsanus tau) boatwhistle calls. This suggests that the researchers might be utilizing hydrophones or other types of acoustic sensors to collect these underwater sounds. Additionally, the use of a pre-trained ResNet-50 convolutional neural network implies that the authors may also be leveraging publicly available datasets for their research. Nevertheless, without more detailed information regarding the data collection process, this remains an assumption.
