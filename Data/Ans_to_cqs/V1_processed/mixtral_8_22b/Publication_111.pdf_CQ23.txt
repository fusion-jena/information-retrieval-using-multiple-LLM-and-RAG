To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were implemented. Firstly, the model was trained using a diverse dataset obtained from the Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency. This dataset likely included various scenarios and conditions, ensuring that the model could learn patterns applicable to different situations. Secondly, the training data was divided into two groups - training and validation sets. The separation of data allowed for tracking the generalization performance of the model during training. Lastly, the early stopping strategy was applied to prevent overfitting or underfitting concerns. This technique involves halting the training process once the model's performance starts to deteriorate after a specific number of epochs. By implementing these measures, the researchers aimed to enhance the robustness and applicability of their deep learning model across different marine environments.
