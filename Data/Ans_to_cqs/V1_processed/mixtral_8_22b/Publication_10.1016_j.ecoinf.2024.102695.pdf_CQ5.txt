The given context does not provide information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the dataset is divided chronologically into 70% for the training set, 10% for the validation set, and 20% for the test set. It also states that the dataset is used for predicting dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in the Shandong Peninsula. Therefore, we can infer that the dataset likely contains historical marine chemical data relevant to DO concentrations in the region. Unfortunately, without more specific details, we cannot determine if any standard datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet were utilized in this particular study.
