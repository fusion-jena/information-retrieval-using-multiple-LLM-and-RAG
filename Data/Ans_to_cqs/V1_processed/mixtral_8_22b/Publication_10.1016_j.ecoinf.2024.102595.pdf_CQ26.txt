The given context does not explicitly mention any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it does discuss the importance of hyperparameter tuning in reducing bias in model predictions. Hyperparameters are parameters whose values are set before the commencement of the learning process. By performing hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV with cross-validation, the authors aimed to find the best combination of hyperparameters that would minimize bias and improve the model's predictive accuracy. Additionally, the context mentions the use of two fundamental techniques in the data transformation process - MinMaxScaler and LabelEncoder. These techniques help prepare the data for input into machine learning algorithms but do not directly address data bias. Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be concluded that while hyperparameter tuning is mentioned as a means to reduce bias in model predictions, no explicit techniques to address data bias during preprocessing are discussed.
