The text mentions that the base models have been obtained from TensorFlow Object Detection API (for segmentation) and the base implementation of TensorFlow (for classification). Additionally, the implementation of ResNet50V2 model in TensorFlow is mentioned for fish classification by species. Therefore, we can conclude that TensorFlow is the primary framework used to build the deep learning models in this study.
