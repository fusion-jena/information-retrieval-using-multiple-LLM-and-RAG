Before training a deep learning model like YOLOv8, several preprocessing steps are typically involved. In this case, the preprocessing was conducted using Python with the OpenCV library. One crucial step mentioned is image inversion, where white pixels representing markings were switched to black pixels, and vice versa for black pixels representing the background. This step likely helps improve contrast and clarity for better recognition by the model. Additionally, label preparation is another essential preprocessing task. All labels were converted into the required format using a Python script, and these labels were then annotated to the original images via Labelbox. Furthermore, a separate script was used to download all scatterplot images along with their respective labels. Automatically creating the necessary data structures and moving images and labels to appropriate folders for training, testing, and validation also contribute to the overall preprocessing pipeline. However, details about other common preprocessing tasks like normalization, scaling, or cleaning are not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
