The given context does not provide information on the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it lists various machine learning models like GLM, MAXENT, RF, ANN, MARS, GBM, CTA, FDA, and SRE, along with some statistical data and references to scientific papers. Therefore, based on this context alone, we cannot determine which datasets were used in the deep learning pipeline.
