The paper by Chalmers et al. (2021) discusses using deep learning models for modelling animal biodiversity through acoustic monitoring. However, it does not specify which specific type of deep learning model was used in their pipeline. Therefore, based on the given information, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
