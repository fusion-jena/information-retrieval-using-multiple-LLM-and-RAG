The given context does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. It primarily focuses on various studies related to NDVI reconstruction techniques and their performance evaluation using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and ERGAS. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information based on the available context.
