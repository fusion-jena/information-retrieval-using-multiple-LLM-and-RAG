The text provides information about the fine-tuning process of the base model with Gulf of Mexico data, including the use of transfer learning, freezing the feature extractor, and updating only the weights of the final dense classification layers during training. However, it does not explicitly mention the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer based solely on the given context.

However, generally speaking, after training a deep learning model, one common approach to deploying it involves saving or serializing the model architecture and its learned weights into a file format such as.h5 or.pt. This serialized model can then be loaded onto various platforms, depending on the requirements of the application. Popular choices include cloud services like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform, where the model can be integrated into web applications or APIs for real-time predictions. Additionally, edge devices like mobile phones or embedded systems may also be suitable targets for model deployment, especially when low latency or offline capabilities are required.
