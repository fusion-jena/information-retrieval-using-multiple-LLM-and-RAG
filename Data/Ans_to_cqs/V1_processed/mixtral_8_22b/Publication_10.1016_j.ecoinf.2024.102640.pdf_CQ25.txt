The purpose of the deep learning model used in GreenCam is semantic segmentation. This model, known as SegFormer, is employed to extract Green View Index (GVI) from photos. It follows an encoder-decoder structure, combining a Transformer-based encoder with a lightweight decoder made up entirely of multilayer perceptron (MLP) blocks. The goal is to accurately identify and classify different elements within an image, specifically focusing on urban green spaces.
