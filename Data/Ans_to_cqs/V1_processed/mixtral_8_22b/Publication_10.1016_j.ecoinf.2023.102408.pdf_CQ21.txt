After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the project or study. In the given context, some of these steps include evaluating variable importance measures to determine the most significant features for predicting Above Ground Biomass (AGB). Additionally, a stratified sampling method was applied to allocate 70% of the samples to the training dataset and the remaining 30% to the validation dataset. Error statistics such as R^2, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) were calculated to compare the accuracy of different models. Furthermore, the generated machine learning models were extrapolated for the entire region. To address overfitting issues, the parameter 'c' was used to optimize the line fit and penalize the number of samples within the margin. These postprocessing steps help ensure the robustness and reliability of the developed models.
