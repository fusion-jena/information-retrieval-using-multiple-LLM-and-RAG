Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and landmark annotation. These techniques help label datasets for various tasks like object detection, image classification, and semantic segmentation. Without more context or details regarding the specific deep learning pipeline mentioned in the text, it is impossible to determine which data annotation techniques have been employed.
