The query asks about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, the given context does not provide specific details about any deep learning pipelines or the use of popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the context focuses on a study related to modeling forest above-ground biomass using various datasets.

From the context, we can gather that the researchers utilized multiple datasets, including:

1. Data from EarthExplorer (<https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/>): This platform provides access to various types of geospatial data, including SRTM DEM data rendered at a resolution of 30 meters. In this case, the authors used this data to supplement their existing dataset.

2. SoilGrids250m: This dataset offers global gridded soil information based on machine learning techniques. It was mentioned in one of the cited sources but not explicitly stated whether it was used in the current study.

3. Freely available satellite and multisource datasets: These were employed to model forest above-ground biomass, according to another cited source. However, no further details regarding the exact datasets used were provided.

Therefore, while the context discusses several datasets used in a study, none of them match the well-known deep learning datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
