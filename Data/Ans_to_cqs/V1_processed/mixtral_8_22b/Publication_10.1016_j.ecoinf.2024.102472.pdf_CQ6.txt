Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning before training the deep learning model. However, some general preprocessing steps can be inferred based on common practices in machine learning and deep learning models.

Before training any deep learning model, including Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Networks (MLPNNs) mentioned in the context, it is essential to prepare the dataset properly. Preprocessing steps may vary depending on the nature of the data and the problem being addressed. Some commonly applied preprocessing techniques include:

1. Data Cleaning: Removing missing values, handling outliers, and correcting inconsistent entries in the dataset.

2. Feature Scaling/Normalization: Transforming features so they fall within a similar range, which helps improve convergence during optimization. Common methods include Min-Max Normalization, Z-score Normalization, and Logarithmic Scaling.

3. Encoding Categorical Variables: Converting categorical variables into numerical representations suitable for use in a deep learning model. Techniques like One-Hot encoding, Label encoding, or Binary encoding might be used.

4. Splitting Dataset: Dividing the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets. Training set is used to train the model, while validation set is utilized to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Testing set evaluates the final performance of the model.

In summary, although the context does not provide direct information regarding preprocessing steps, generally accepted best practices involve data cleaning, feature scaling/normalization, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset into appropriate subsets for training, validation, and testing purposes.
