The provided context does not contain specific information on data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, generally speaking, some common data annotation techniques used in deep learning include bounding box annotation, where objects within images are identified by drawing boxes around them; semantic segmentation, which involves labeling each pixel in an image with its corresponding class; and instance segmentation, which combines object detection and semantic segmentation to identify individual instances of objects within an image. Other techniques include landmark annotation, polygon annotation, and key point annotation. The choice of technique depends on the specific application and requirements of the project.
