Based on the given context, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is primarily images or image data. Specifically, the research papers mentioned in the context discuss the use of hyperspectral images, multispectral images, and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for various applications such as land cover classification, biomass estimation, and object detection. Additionally, some studies also utilize altitude data and other geospatial information. However, there is no mention of any other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV files being used in these pipelines. Therefore, based on the available context, we can conclude that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipelines discussed here is image data.
