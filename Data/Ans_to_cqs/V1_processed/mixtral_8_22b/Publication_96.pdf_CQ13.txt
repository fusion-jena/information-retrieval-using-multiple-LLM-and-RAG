In the given context, the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are mentioned during the training phase of the algorithm. These include:

1. Learning Rate: This is set to 0.001. The learning rate determines how much to change the model in response to the estimated error each time the model weights are updated.

2. Batch Size: This is set to 1,000. The batch size is a number of samples processed before the model is updated.

3. Number of Interactions: This is set to 7,000. The number of interactions refers to the number of times the learning algorithm will work through the entire training dataset.

However, the type of optimizer used is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
