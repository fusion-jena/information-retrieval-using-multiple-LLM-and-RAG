The given context does not provide any direct reference or link to a specific data repository containing the deep learning pipeline used by M. Torresani et al. However, it mentions two datasets used in their research - Lang10m and Potapov30m. The links to download these datasets are provided as follows:

1. Lang10m: <https://langnico.github.io/globalcanopyheight/>
2. Potapov30m: <https://glad.umd.edu/dataset/gedi/>

These links may lead to further resources related to the deep learning pipeline used in this study. Unfortunately, without additional context or information, I cannot provide a more precise answer regarding the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline itself.
