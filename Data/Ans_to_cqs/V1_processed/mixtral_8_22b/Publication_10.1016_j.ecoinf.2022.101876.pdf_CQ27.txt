The text does not provide specific details about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. It discusses the use of AI and machine learning models to automate tasks like detecting and classifying wildlife in images, but it doesn't mention any steps related to model serialization or platform selection for deployment. Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot provide a detailed answer regarding the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
