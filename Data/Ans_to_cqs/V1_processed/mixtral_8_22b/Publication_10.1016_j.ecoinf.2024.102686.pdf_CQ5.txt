The datasets mentioned in the given context do not include any commonly known deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, they focus on various environmental and geographical datasets related to human activities, natural endowments, climatic conditions, vegetation conditions, etc. These datasets have been collected from different sources like Resource and Environment Science and Data Center, National Meteorological Science Data Center, Harmonized World Soil Database, Open Spatial Demographic Data and Research, etc. The specific datasets mentioned in this context include population density, economic density, land use intensity, precipitation, temperature, evapotranspiration, soil type, elevation, slope, NDVI, and vegetation type. However, these datasets are not directly relevant to a deep learning pipeline for image classification tasks.
