The text does not provide explicit information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it mentions several general data preprocessing methods employed in this study. These include data cleansing, which involves identifying and removing incomplete or inaccurate records to improve dataset accuracy. Additionally, the text discusses data imputation techniques like mean imputation, which replaces missing data with the average of the remaining values. Another mentioned technique is capping, which limits dataset values using a fixed threshold to keep them within allowed parameters. While these methods contribute to enhancing data quality and integrity, they do not directly address data bias issues typically encountered in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, based on the given context, it cannot be determined if any specific techniques were utilized to tackle data bias during preprocessing.
