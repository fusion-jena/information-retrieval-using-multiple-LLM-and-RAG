The main statistical terms and calculations used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model include sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), accuracy (ACC), Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), mean (μ), and standard deviation (σ). These metrics are described in detail in Table 3 of the given context.

Sensitivity measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified by the model. Specificity measures the proportion of actual negatives that are correctly identified by the model. PPV is the probability that a subject with a positive test result actually has the condition. NPV is the probability that a subject with a negative test result does not have the condition. Accuracy is the proportion of true results (both true positives and true negatives) among the total number of cases examined. MCC is a measure of the quality of binary classifications. It takes into account true and false positives and negatives, and is generally regarded as a balanced measure which can be used even if the classes are of very different sizes. Mean and standard deviation are used to summarize the distribution of values in a dataset.
