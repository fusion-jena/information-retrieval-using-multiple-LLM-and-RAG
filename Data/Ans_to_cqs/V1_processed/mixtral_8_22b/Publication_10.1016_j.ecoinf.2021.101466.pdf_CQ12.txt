In the given context, the deep learning model used in the pipeline is EfficientNet, which is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The EfficientNet model was introduced in the paper titled "EfficientNet: Rethinking Model Scaling for Convolutional Neural Networks" by Tan and Le in 2019. It is designed to scale up the baseline network while maintaining the same level of computational resources. The authors propose a new scaling method called compound scaling, which uniformly scales the width, depth, and resolution of the network. This approach allows them to create a family of models, ranging from EfficientNet-B0 to EfficientNet-B7, where each subsequent model has higher capacity and performance compared to its predecessor.

In the given context, the EfficientNet model is used in conjunction with YOLOv4, another deep learning model that is also based on CNN architecture. Specifically, the output from YOLOv4 is fed into the EfficientNet model to re-identify the candidate regions. This suggests that both models are part of the same pipeline, with YOLOv4 being responsible for detecting objects in the input image, and EfficientNet being responsible for classifying those detected objects.

Overall, the use of EfficientNet in this pipeline demonstrates the effectiveness of CNN architectures in computer vision tasks such as object detection and classification.
