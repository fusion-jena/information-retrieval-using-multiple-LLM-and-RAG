Based on the given context, there isn't any direct information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, common practices in machine learning include stopping the training process when the validation loss plateaus or starts increasing, indicating overfitting. Other methods may involve setting a maximum number of epochs or iterations, or using early stopping techniques based on performance metrics. Without more specific details from the context, it's not possible to provide a definitive answer.
