The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involved evaluating both errors and time costs. The iteration termination condition of the model remained consistent across all rounds of training, with the loss rate of the model required to be less than a predetermined threshold of 1.0 Ã— 10^-4. A fixed test set was employed to evaluate the performance of the models at different stages of training. Model error assessment utilized three distinct metrics: overall error, commission error, and omission error, defined by equations (2), (3), and (4) respectively. As the sample size expanded, the model errors diminished while maintaining the same configuration parameters. For instance, utilizing merely 7,298 images (20% of the BMXSM dataset), the overall error, omission error, and commission error of their approach stood at 5.21%, 14.86%, and 11.37%, respectively. However, upon employing 29,192 images (80% of the BMXSM dataset), these errors reduced significantly to 2.69%, 6.45%, and 6.82%. Training time expenses varied considerably depending on the training mode and computing platform used.
