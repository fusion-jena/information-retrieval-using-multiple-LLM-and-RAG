Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to determine which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. The text mentions various components of a data platform, including data sources, integration and enrichment processes, validation and loading procedures, and analytical fruition. However, it does not provide any explicit reference to a cloud service provider or platform like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. Therefore, I cannot accurately identify the platform used to deploy the deep learning model.
