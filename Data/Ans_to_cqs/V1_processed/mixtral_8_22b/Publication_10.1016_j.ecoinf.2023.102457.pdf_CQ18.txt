Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide a detailed response about the specific strategies implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it can be inferred that some form of monitoring was done due to the reported accuracy results. Typically, when training deep learning models like BirdNET, several strategies are employed to monitor their performance. These may include tracking metrics such as loss or accuracy on validation datasets, visualizing the learning process through tools like TensorBoard, or implementing early stopping mechanisms to prevent overfitting. Additionally, cross-validation techniques might have been utilized to ensure robustness and generalizability of the model. Nonetheless, without explicit details regarding these aspects, it remains uncertain what exact strategies were adopted for this particular case.
