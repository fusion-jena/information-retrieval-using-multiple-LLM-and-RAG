The given context does not provide specific details about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general practices in deep learning, some commonly used data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, and color shifting. These techniques help increase the diversity of the training data without collecting new images, which can improve the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. It is important to note that the choice of data augmentation techniques depends on the nature of the problem and the characteristics of the input data. Therefore, without further context or information, it is not possible to determine which specific data augmentation techniques were applied in this case.
