In the provided context, there is mention of one specific method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline - dropout layers. Dropout is a regularization technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to prevent complex co-adaptations on training data. This technique is mentioned in the context as being used with dropout rates of 0.2 and 0.3. However, other common regularization techniques like L2 regularization or early stopping are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, while dropout is confirmed as a method used in this case, it cannot be definitively stated whether these other methods were also employed without further information.
