The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that the model is used for multi-class classification. The dataset includes ten classes representing the most profitable and endangered species in the Peruvian Amazon forest. The authors use various pre-trained models like AlexNet, VGG-19, ResNet-101, and DenseNet-201, adjusting their fully connected blocks to output the ten species of leaves. They also mention that the models learn specific higher-level features, such as arrangements and venations, suggesting that they are being trained for classification purposes.
