The text does not provide specific information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that overfitting can occur when training CNNs on acoustic datasets containing very few vocalization examples of various species. Overfitting refers to a situation where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on new data that was not used in training. Regularization techniques such as dropout and L2 regularization can help prevent overfitting by introducing noise during training or penalizing large weights, respectively. Dropout randomly drops out neurons during training, while L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function based on the sum of squared weights. Other regularization methods include early stopping, weight decay, and batch normalization. Early stopping involves monitoring the validation error during training and stopping when it starts to increase, indicating that the model is beginning to overfit. Weight decay is similar to L2 regularization but uses a different formulation. Batch normalization standardizes inputs to each layer, reducing internal covariate shift and improving generalization.
