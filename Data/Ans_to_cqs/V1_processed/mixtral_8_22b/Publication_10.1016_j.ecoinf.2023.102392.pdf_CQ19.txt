Unfortunately, based on the given information, it is not possible to determine which specific frameworks were used to build the deep learning models mentioned in the papers. The papers do not provide explicit details about the programming languages or libraries used to develop their models. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding whether they used TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other specific deep learning framework.
