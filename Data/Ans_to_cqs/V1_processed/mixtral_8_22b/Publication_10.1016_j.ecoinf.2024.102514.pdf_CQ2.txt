Based on the given context, it does not provide specific information about the data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, since the study focuses on assessing water quality using machine learning approaches, it can be assumed that the dataset might include numerical values such as temperature, pH levels, dissolved oxygen, etc. These types of data are typically stored in structured formats like CSV files. The context also mentions the use of spatial distribution analysis, which suggests that geospatial data may have been used in the form of shapefiles or GeoJSON files. Nevertheless, without explicit mention of the data format used in the deep learning pipeline, it cannot be confirmed with certainty.
