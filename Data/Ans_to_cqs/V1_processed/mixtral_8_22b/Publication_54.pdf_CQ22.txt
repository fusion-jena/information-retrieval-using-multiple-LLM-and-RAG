Three standard metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in identifying individual bird species: True Positive (TP), True Negative (TN), False Positive (FP), and False Negative (FN). These metrics help measure the effectiveness of the model in correctly detecting endemic and nonendemic birds. However, it should be noted that these metrics do not directly provide information on the overall accuracy, precision, or recall of the model. Instead, they focus specifically on the classification results for each category (endemic vs. nonendemic birds).

For more specific details about the accuracy comparison between different benchmark network models, including Inception-ResNet-v2, Inception-v3, Xception, ResNet101, and MobileNetV2, please refer to Figure 5 and its accompanying description in section A. This will give you insights into how well each model performs in terms of training, validation, and test accuracies.

As mentioned earlier, the Inception-ResNet-v2 model was found to achieve the highest accuracy among all tested models, reaching 100% training accuracy, 97.47% validation accuracy, and 97.11% test accuracy.
