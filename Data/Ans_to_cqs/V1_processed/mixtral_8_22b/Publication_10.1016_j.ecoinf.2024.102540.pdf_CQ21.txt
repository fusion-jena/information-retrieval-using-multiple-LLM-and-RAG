After the model training, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the project. Some common postprocessing steps include calculating evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the curve (AUC), which help assess the performance of the trained models. Another important step is creating confusion matrices, which provide a visual representation of the classification results by displaying true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. Additionally, saliency maps or heatmaps can also be generated to highlight the regions of interest in the input images that contributed most significantly to the final prediction made by the model. These postprocessing steps aid in interpreting the model's predictions and identifying any potential biases or weaknesses in the model.
