The text does not provide specific information about the dataset used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the model was trained on a dataset consisting of 306, 195, 533, 424, 449, 416, 425, and 528 images, totaling 3276 images. It also states that the model was trained from scratch, which suggests that this dataset might have been created specifically for this project rather than being a well-known dataset like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
