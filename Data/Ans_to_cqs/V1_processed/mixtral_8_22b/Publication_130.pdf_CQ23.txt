To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the training dataset contained a diverse set of images captured under various lighting conditions and shadows to account for variations in recording conditions. This helped the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to perform effectively across different contexts. Secondly, the dataset included a substantial number of images from both majority and minority classes, despite having an imbalanced dataset. For instance, in the case of the sociable weaver population, 30 out of 35 individuals had more than 350 pictures, while in the great tit population, 10 out of 77 birds had more than 350 pictures. To further mitigate the impact of the imbalance, oversampling was employed by creating duplicates of randomly sampled images for the bird with fewer images. Lastly, the use of small batch sizes during training improved the model's generalization capability, as demonstrated by Masters & Luschi (2018). Overall, these measures aimed to enhance the robustness and adaptability of the deep learning model in handling real-world scenarios.
