The given context does not provide specific information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. Data augmentation is a strategy that enables practitioners to significantly increase the diversity of training datasets available for neural networks without actually collecting new data. The most common types of data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, padding, and zooming. These techniques can be applied individually or combined to create more variations of the input data. However, it should be noted that the choice of data augmentation technique depends on the nature of the problem being solved and the characteristics of the dataset. Therefore, based on the given context, we cannot determine which data augmentation techniques were applied in the deep learning pipeline.
