The method utilized for collecting raw data in this deep learning pipeline is a bug-picture database. This database consists of pictures of bugs, specifically those belonging to the family Reduviidae, subfamily Triatominae, also known as triatomines or kissing bugs. These insects are important because they transmit Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite responsible for causing Chagas disease. The database contains 6570 pictures, which were divided into a training set (80%) and a testing set (20%). All algorithms were trained on the training set, while their performance was evaluated using the testing set. This process was repeated ten times for each algorithm to ensure consistency in performance. The algorithms used include a convolutional neural network (AlexNet), three boosting-based classifiers (AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and Histogram-based Gradient Boosting), and a linear discriminant model.
