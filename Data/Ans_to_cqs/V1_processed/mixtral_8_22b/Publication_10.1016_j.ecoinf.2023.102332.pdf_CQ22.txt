The given context does not provide information about the specific evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the deep learning model. However, commonly used metrics for evaluating deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the curve (AUC). Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions made by the model. Precision indicates the ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives. Recall shows the ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives. The F1 score combines both precision and recall into a single metric. Lastly, the AUC represents the degree or measure of separability between classes.
