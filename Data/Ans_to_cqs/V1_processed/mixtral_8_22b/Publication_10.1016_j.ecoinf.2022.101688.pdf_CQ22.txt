The metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models in this context is the F1 score. The F1 score is a measure of a test's accuracy that considers both the precision and recall of the test to compute the score. It is calculated as the harmonic mean of precision and recall. In this case, the F1 scores are reported for various network architectures and dataset configurations, with the results being averaged across multiple unique executions. The highest-performing network architectures for each dataset configuration are highlighted in bold.
