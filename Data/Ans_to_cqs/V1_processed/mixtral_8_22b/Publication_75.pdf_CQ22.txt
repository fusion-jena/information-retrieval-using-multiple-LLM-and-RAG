To evaluate the performance of their deep learning models, A. Loddo et al. used several performance measures. These include Average Retrieval Precision (ARP), Average Retrieval Rate (ARR), Fscore, and Mean Average Precision (mAP). Each metric has its own mathematical formula, which is given in equations (9)-(12) in the paper. Additionally, they also used Accuracy (Acc), Specificity (Spec), and Sensitivity (Sen) to further assess the performance of their networks. Equations (1)-(3) provide the definitions for these three metrics.
