Before training a deep learning model like the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model mentioned in the given context, several preprocessing steps are typically involved. These steps help prepare the data for optimal training and to avoid issues like overfitting or underfitting.

One common preprocessing step is normalization or scaling. In the given context, the authors mention using a MinMaxScaler to transform each feature by scaling it to a [0â€“1] range. This technique helps bring all features to a comparable scale, which is crucial when dealing with variables of varying magnitudes. Normalization ensures that no single feature dominates the learning process due to its larger numerical values.

Another important preprocessing step is handling missing or inconsistent data. Although not explicitly mentioned in the given context, it is generally recommended to clean the dataset by removing or imputing missing values. Data cleaning can involve identifying outliers, correcting errors, or even dropping unnecessary features.

To prevent overfitting, the authors add a dropout layer to their LSTM model. Dropout is a regularization method that randomly excludes some inputs from activation and weight updates during training. By doing so, dropout encourages the model to learn more robust features and reduces reliance on any particular input.

Lastly, the authors emphasize selecting the appropriate dimension of the temporal window dynamically, considering the performance obtained with different values on the available dataset. This step involves determining how much historical data should be considered when making predictions, which depends on the problem at hand and the nature of the time series data.
