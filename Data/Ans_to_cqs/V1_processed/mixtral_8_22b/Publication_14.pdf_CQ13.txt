The text does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model. However, it does state that the model was trained with a batch size of 100 for 20,000 steps. This information could potentially help in inferring some aspects of the model's configuration, but without more details, it is impossible to provide a complete list of the hyperparameters used.
