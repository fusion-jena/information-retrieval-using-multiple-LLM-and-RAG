The given context does not provide information about specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotation, or scaling. However, it discusses the application of deep learning methods, specifically focusing on SLSTM and SGRU models, for time-series prediction tasks. These models are extensions of traditional LSTM networks and GRUs, respectively, designed to handle long-term dependencies and seasonality in sequential data. The context also mentions successful applications of these models in areas like agricultural product sales forecasting and predicting the Pacific decadal oscillation index.

Data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, and scaling are commonly used in image classification tasks within deep learning pipelines. They help improve the robustness and generalizability of trained models by creating new training samples from existing ones. For example, flipping images horizontally or vertically generates mirror images, while rotations and scalings alter the orientation and size of objects in the images. Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques related to time-series prediction tasks involving SLSTM and SGRU models.
