Based on the given context, it does not provide information about the use of any standard datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet in the deep learning pipeline. Instead, the context mentions the use of a custom dataset containing weather and micro-meteorological data recorded over several years. This dataset is used to estimate ETo and is further processed using a specific software developed by Manca (2003). The resulting dataset is then utilized for training and evaluating machine learning models like ANNs and Random Forests. Therefore, no standard datasets were mentioned in this context.
