The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific process used to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it discusses various aspects related to wildfire event prediction in Australia using deep learning technology. Halgamuge et al. (2020) developed an algorithm to automatically collect data and analyze six different optimizer models using deep learning. While the paper focuses on the development and application of these models, it does not provide details about the deployment process. Similarly, Dowdy (2020) presents a seasonal prediction system for wildfire event prediction but does not elaborate on the deployment process. Therefore, without additional information, it is impossible to determine the exact process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
