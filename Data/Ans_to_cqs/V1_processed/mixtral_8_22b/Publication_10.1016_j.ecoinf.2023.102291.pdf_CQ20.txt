The model training and prediction procedures were executed on Microsoft Azure using instance NV12s v3 with 12 vCPUs and 112 GB RAM. This suggests that the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model include CPUs and RAM, but it does not explicitly mention the use of GPUs or TPUs. However, considering that the task involves training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the fact that GPU acceleration is commonly used for such tasks due to their computational requirements, it is reasonable to infer that GPUs might have been utilized. Nonetheless, without explicit information about the use of GPUs or TPUs, we cannot definitively state which specific hardware resources were employed for training the deep learning model.
