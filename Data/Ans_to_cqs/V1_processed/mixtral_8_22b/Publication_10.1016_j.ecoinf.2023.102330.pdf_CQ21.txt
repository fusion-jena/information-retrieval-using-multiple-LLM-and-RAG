The given context does not provide information about the specific machine learning or deep learning model used, nor does it mention any postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, confusion matrices, etc. Therefore, it is impossible to determine what postprocessing steps would be involved after model training based solely on the provided context. However, generally speaking, common postprocessing steps include evaluating the performance of the trained model using various evaluation metrics, visualizing the results through techniques like saliency maps, and fine-tuning the model if necessary.
