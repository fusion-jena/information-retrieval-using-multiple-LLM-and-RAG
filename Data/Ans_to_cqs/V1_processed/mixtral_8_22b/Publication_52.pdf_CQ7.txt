The query asks about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into different sets like train, test, and validation. However, the provided context does not explicitly mention any specific criteria for splitting the data. Nevertheless, some common practices for splitting data in deep learning include:

* Randomly splitting the dataset into three subsets: training, testing, and validation. Typically, the ratio used is 60% for training, 20% for testing, and 20% for validation. This ensures that the model is trained on a large enough dataset, tested on a separate dataset to evaluate its performance, and validated on another dataset to fine-tune hyperparameters.
* Stratified sampling: When dealing with imbalanced datasets, stratified sampling can be used to ensure that each subset contains approximately the same proportion of samples from each class. This helps prevent overfitting and improves the model's ability to generalize.
* Time series data: For time series data, a common practice is to use a rolling window approach, where the first n observations are used for training, the next m observations are used for validation, and the remaining observations are used for testing. This allows the model to capture temporal dependencies in the data.
