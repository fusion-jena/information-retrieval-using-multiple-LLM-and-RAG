The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. However, there are some clues about the type of data being processed. For instance, the text mentions "images" which suggests that image data might be one of the types of input used in this particular deep learning application. Additionally, the paper titled "Estimating the population size of migrating Tibetan antelopes Pantholops hodgsonii with unmanned aerial vehicles" implies that drone footage could potentially be another source of data collection. Nevertheless, without further information, we cannot definitively state what methods are specifically employed for gathering raw data in this case.
