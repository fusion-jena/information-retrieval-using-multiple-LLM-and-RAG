The given context does not provide specific information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, some common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, zooming, shearing, and translation. These techniques help increase the size of the training dataset and improve the generalizability of the models. It should be noted that the choice of data augmentation techniques depends on the nature of the problem and the characteristics of the input data. For instance, in image classification tasks, geometric transformations such as flipping, rotation, and scaling may be more appropriate, whereas color space transformations like brightness adjustment or contrast enhancement might be better suited for other types of problems.
