The given text does not provide any specific details about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN). Therefore, I cannot determine which hardware resources like GPUs, TPUs, or others were utilized for training these models.
