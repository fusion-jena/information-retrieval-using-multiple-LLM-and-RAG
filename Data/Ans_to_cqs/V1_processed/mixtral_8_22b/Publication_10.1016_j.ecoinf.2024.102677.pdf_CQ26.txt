Based on the given context, it appears that stratified sampling was used to divide the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets. Stratified sampling is a method used to ensure that each subset of the dataset represents the overall population proportionally. This technique helps prevent any potential biases or imbalances in the distribution of classes within the subsets. However, the context does not provide information about other techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection being used for addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, while stratified sampling was utilized, there is no mention of the use of additional techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.
