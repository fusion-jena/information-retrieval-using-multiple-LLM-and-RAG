The given context does not provide specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge, some common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include:

1. Bounding Box Annotation: This technique involves drawing a rectangle around the object of interest in an image. It is commonly used for object detection tasks.

2. Semantic Segmentation: In semantic segmentation, each pixel in an image is assigned a label corresponding to the object or region it belongs to. This technique is often used for scene understanding tasks.

3. Instance Segmentation: Similar to semantic segmentation, but instead of assigning one label to all pixels belonging to the same object, each individual object is identified separately. This technique is useful when dealing with multiple objects of the same type within an image.

4. Polygon Annotation: This method involves manually tracing the outline of an object in an image. It is typically used for irregularly shaped objects.

5. Landmark Annotation: Also known as key-point annotation, this technique involves marking specific points on an object in an image. It is often used for facial recognition tasks.

6. Line Annotation: Used for lane line detection in autonomous driving applications.

7. Cuboid Annotation: Used for 3D object detection tasks.

Without more specific context, I cannot determine which of these techniques was used in the research mentioned.
