In this study, the authors utilized a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) called AlexNet for butterfly classification. This particular CNN architecture was introduced by Alex Krizhevsky and won the 2012 ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge. AlexNet consists of eight layers, including five convolutional layers and three fully connected layers. The feature extractors were initialized with white Gaussian noise and learned from the data. The resulting feature maps then went through rectified linear units (ReLUs), a type of non-linearity unit. The model was trained using stochastic gradient descent and the backpropagation algorithm included in Caffe, with the learning rate policy set to'step'. Initially, the learning rate was set to 10^-2 for all layers to accommodate the newly defined last fully connected layer, also set to 10^-2. The learning rate was subsequently reduced during training.
