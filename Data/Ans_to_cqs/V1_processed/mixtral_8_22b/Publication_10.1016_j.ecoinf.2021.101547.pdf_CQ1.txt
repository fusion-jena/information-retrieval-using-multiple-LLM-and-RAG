The papers cited do not explicitly mention specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, they do suggest various sources of data collection. For instance, Laliberte and Ripple (2003) discuss automated wildlife counts from remotely sensed imagery, implying that satellite or drone imagery could be used for gathering data. LaRue et al. (2017) explore the feasibility of utilizing high-resolution satellite imagery to evaluate vertebrate wildlife populations, further supporting this notion. Leblanc et al. (2016) examine spectral reflectance of polar bear and other large Arctic mammals, indicating that sensor data might be employed for data acquisition. Additionally, LeCun et al. (2015) touch upon deep learning without specifying any particular method for obtaining raw data. In conclusion, although no explicit methods are mentioned, these papers hint at possible ways of acquiring raw data, including satellite/drone imagery and sensor data.
