The article does not provide specific information about which frameworks were used to build the deep learning models. However, common frameworks used for building deep learning models include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. These frameworks offer tools and libraries that simplify the process of creating and training neural networks. Without explicit mention in the given context, it cannot be definitively stated which framework was utilized in this particular study.

The abstract of the paper discusses the use of both machine learning and deep learning models for predicting oil palm yields. While the authors do not explicitly state which framework they used for developing the deep learning models, popular choices among researchers include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. Each of these frameworks provides a set of tools and libraries designed to facilitate the creation and training of neural networks. Given the lack of specific details regarding the employed framework in the provided context, one cannot conclusively determine which framework was used in this study.
