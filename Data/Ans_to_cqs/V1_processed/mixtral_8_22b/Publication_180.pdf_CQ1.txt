The text does not provide specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of TensorFlow, a popular open-source software library for machine intelligence, for image classification tasks related to Chagas disease vectors. This suggests that the raw data collected might be image data, possibly obtained through digital imaging techniques or publicly available datasets. Nevertheless, without explicit details regarding the collection process, one cannot definitively state the exact methodologies employed for gathering raw data in this particular case.

The provided context focuses more on the utilization of TensorFlow for deep learning tasks rather than discussing the initial stages of data acquisition. Therefore, while it can be inferred that image data is involved, further clarification would be required to accurately describe the methods used for collecting raw data in this deep learning pipeline.
