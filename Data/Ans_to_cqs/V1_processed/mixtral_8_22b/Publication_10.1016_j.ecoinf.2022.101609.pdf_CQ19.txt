The text does not explicitly mention which specific deep learning framework was used to build the model. However, it mentions that the study uses fastai's library for tabular data, which suggests that the researchers might have used FastAI, a popular deep learning library built on top of PyTorch. Therefore, we can infer that they likely used PyTorch as the underlying deep learning framework.
