The PLUS model does not appear to use any specific deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. Instead, it utilizes the Random Forest algorithm, which is a machine learning technique, to obtain development probabilities of each land use type based on two periods of land use data. Therefore, no specific deep learning model is mentioned in the given context.
