The text does not provide information about specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it mentions the use of a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for covey call detection. In general, during training of CNNs, various optimization algorithms like SGD, Adam, RMSprop etc. are employed to minimize the loss function and update the weights of the network. But without explicit mention of the optimization technique used in this case, we cannot definitively state which one was utilized.
