The text mentions one specific regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline - Dropout Regularization. This technique involves adding a dropout layer to the Deep Neural Network (DNN) model, which randomly removes different sets of neurons during each iteration of training. By doing so, multiple neural networks with varying architectures are trained simultaneously, reducing overfitting and improving generalization performance.

In addition to dropout regularization, other common regularization methods mentioned indirectly in the given context include stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Exponential Linear Unit (ELU) activation function. While these aren't explicitly referred to as regularization methods, they do contribute to preventing overfitting and enhancing model performance. Stochastic Gradient Descent helps overcome local minima issues, while ELU addresses limitations associated with Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs), such as dead neurons and slow convergence.

However, it should be noted that the text does not provide explicit information on whether or not L2 regularization was employed in their approach. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, we cannot confirm its use alongside dropout regularization.
