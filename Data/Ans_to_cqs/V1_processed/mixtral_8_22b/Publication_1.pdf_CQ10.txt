Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to determine the exact code repository link of the deep learning pipeline used by Conservation Metrics, Inc. The paper does not mention any links to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or other version control platforms where the source code might be hosted. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a direct link to the code repository. However, if more information becomes available, I would be happy to assist further.
