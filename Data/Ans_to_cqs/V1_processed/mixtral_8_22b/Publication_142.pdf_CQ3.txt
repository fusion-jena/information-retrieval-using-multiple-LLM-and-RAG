The provided context does not explicitly mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it discusses the use of the Pl@ntNet classification tool, which uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on ImageNet and fine-tuned on Pl@ntNet data. This suggests that some form of image labeling was performed during the creation of the Pl@ntNet dataset. Additionally, the authors mention searching Flickr for images containing the word 'flower', indicating that keyword tagging was also utilized. In summary, while the exact data annotation techniques employed in the deep learning pipeline are not specified, it appears that image labeling and keyword tagging played significant roles in preparing the dataset for analysis.
