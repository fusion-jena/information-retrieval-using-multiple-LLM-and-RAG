The text does not explicitly mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions a dataset shared via a GitHub repository (<https://github.com/zhangchuanyin/weed-datasets>), which might be related to the project or study. Unfortunately, without additional information, I cannot determine if this repository also includes the deep learning pipeline code.
