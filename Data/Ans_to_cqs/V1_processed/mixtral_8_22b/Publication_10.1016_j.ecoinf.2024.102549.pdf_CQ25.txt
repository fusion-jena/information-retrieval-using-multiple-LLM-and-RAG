The purpose of the deep learning model employed in this study is for image classification. Specifically, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is utilized to classify input images into three distinct water quality level labels: Class I, Class II, and Class III. This is achieved through the use of multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers within the AlexNet architecture. The goal is to accurately categorize water quality based on remote sensing data, thereby providing valuable insights for environmental monitoring and management.
