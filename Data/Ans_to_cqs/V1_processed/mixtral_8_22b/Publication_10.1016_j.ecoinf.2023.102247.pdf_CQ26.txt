During the preprocessing stage of a deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed to address data bias. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets or strata based on specific criteria such as class labels. This ensures that each subset maintains the original class proportions, preventing any imbalance between classes. It helps in creating representative training and validation sets.

Oversampling is a technique used when dealing with imbalanced datasets where one class has significantly fewer samples compared to others. In this case, synthetic examples of the minority class are generated to balance the dataset. Techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) can be applied for oversampling.

Undersampling, conversely, reduces the number of instances in the majority class to match the size of the minority class. Random undersampling or informed undersampling methods can be utilized depending upon the nature of the problem.

Lastly, collecting diverse data is another way to mitigate data bias. By gathering data from various sources, it becomes possible to capture a broader representation of real-world scenarios, reducing potential biases introduced by limited or skewed data.

These techniques help improve the overall robustness and generalization capabilities of deep learning models by ensuring fair representation across all classes within the dataset.
