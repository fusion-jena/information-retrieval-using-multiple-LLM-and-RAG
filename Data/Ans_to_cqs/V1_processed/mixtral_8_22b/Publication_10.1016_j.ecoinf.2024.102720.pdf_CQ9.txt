The information provided does not explicitly mention where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, without additional context or specific details about the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the report, it is impossible to determine which data repository hosts this particular deep learning pipeline. Some common repositories for sharing code and datasets related to machine learning projects are GitHub, Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, and GBIF. However, further clarification would be needed to provide a more accurate response.
