The given context does not directly discuss specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it mentions some aspects related to handling data biases and improving computational efficiency.

In the context of the Firemap project, the authors mention using Random Forest (RF) regression algorithm for building relationships between Fractional Cover (FCOVER) and corresponding reflectance in the Sentinel-2 (S2) band configuration. They also state that they preserve the default values for RF hyperparameters except for the number of trees, which is set to 500 to improve computational efficiency in Google Earth Engine (GEE). This indicates their focus on optimizing computational resources while maintaining accuracy.

Additionally, the text highlights the importance of selecting appropriate bands to discriminate the burned signal by operating with individual bands instead of using context-dependent, broadband spectral indices with limited spectral information. It suggests that complex interactions among bands as inputs in data-mining machine learning approaches can be expected. This implies that careful consideration should be given to input features to minimize potential biases and ensure accurate results.

Lastly, the context points out issues with cloud masks in Sentinel-2 Level-1C scenes, where omission errors might be higher than 50%. To mitigate this problem, the authors suggest using Sentinel-2 Level-2 A scenes, although these might have topography overcorrection in mountain areas. Future implementations aim to include more user options like multi-temporal approaches and additional sensors to further enhance the processing pipeline.

While these details do not explicitly cover the mentioned techniques for addressing data bias, they demonstrate efforts towards reducing biases through optimal feature selection, efficient resource utilization, and improved scene selection.
