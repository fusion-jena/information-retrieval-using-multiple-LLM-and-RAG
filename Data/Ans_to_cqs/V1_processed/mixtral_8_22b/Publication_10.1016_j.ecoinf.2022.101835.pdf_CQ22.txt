The performance of the algorithms was evaluated by comparing the loss function (mean squared error (MSE)) of the optimized models. In addition, the mean absolute error (MAE) and the coefficient of determination (R2) were calculated for reference. Furthermore, the root mean square error (RMSE) was calculated for all observation sites to evaluate the overall performance of the optimized models, and the RMSE for each observation site was calculated to evaluate the performance of the models for each site. Therefore, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model include the mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), coefficient of determination (R2), and root mean square error (RMSE).
