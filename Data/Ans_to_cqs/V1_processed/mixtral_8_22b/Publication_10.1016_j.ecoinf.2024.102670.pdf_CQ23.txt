The given context does not provide explicit information about any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model mentioned. However, some potential indicators of such efforts could include the use of crowd-sourcing for obtaining manual annotations, as well as the application of various representations to visualize the network structure. These practices might suggest an attempt to incorporate diverse perspectives and approaches into the development of the model. Nonetheless, without more detailed information regarding the training process or evaluation techniques employed, it remains unclear whether strategies like diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting were implemented to enhance the model's generalizability.
