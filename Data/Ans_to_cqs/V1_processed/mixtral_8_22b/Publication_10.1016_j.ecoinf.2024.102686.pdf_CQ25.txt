The text does not provide explicit information about the specific purpose or type of deep learning model used. However, based on the given context, we can infer that the deep learning model might be used for clustering or categorizing data, specifically ecological and environmental data. This is suggested by the mention of Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), which are a type of neural network often used for clustering and visualization tasks. Additionally, the discussion of the need to determine the optimal number of categories indicates that the model is likely being used for some form of categorization or grouping of data points.
