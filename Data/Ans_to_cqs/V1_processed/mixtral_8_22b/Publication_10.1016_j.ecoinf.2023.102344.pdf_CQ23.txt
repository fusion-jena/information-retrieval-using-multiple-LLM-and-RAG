To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, a diverse dataset was collected from five different location sites in Portugal, consisting of 300 data-filled rows. Secondly, stratified sampling was employed, where 80% (240 data rows) of the dataset was used for training the model and 20% (60 data rows) for testing. This approach helps to maintain the same proportion of each class in both the training and test sets, ensuring that the model can perform well on unseen data. Lastly, all pre-trained models under Approach 1 converged the training after 1000 epochs with Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (SGDM) as the optimization algorithm. Similarly, all pre-trained models under Approach 2 also converged the training after 1000 epochs with SGDM as the optimization algorithm. These steps help to prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.
