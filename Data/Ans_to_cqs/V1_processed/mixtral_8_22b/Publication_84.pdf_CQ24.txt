The article does not provide explicit information on handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some common strategies used in deep learning pipelines include fixing the random seed value before training models or using techniques like cross-validation to reduce the impact of random initialization on model performance. Additionally, ensemble methods can be employed to combine multiple models trained with different initializations, which may help mitigate the effects of randomness.
