The text does not provide information on what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline. It only mentions that Runge et al. (2022) optimized the LTR, but it does not specify whether this is a convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), transformer, or another type of model. Therefore, I do not know what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline based on the given context.
