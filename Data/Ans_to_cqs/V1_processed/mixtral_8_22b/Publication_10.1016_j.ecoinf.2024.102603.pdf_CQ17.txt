The query asks about regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. Regularization techniques help improve the generalization capability of machine learning models by adding a penalty term to the loss function during optimization. This prevents complex models from fitting the noise present in the training data, which would otherwise lead to poor performance on new, unseen data.

Two common regularization methods mentioned in the query are dropout and L2 regularization. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps reduce interdependent learning amongst the neurons. By doing so, dropout encourages the network to learn more robust features that are useful in conjunction with various random subsets of the other neurons.

On the other hand, L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty equivalent to the sum of squares of all the weights multiplied by a constant factor to the loss function. This discourages large weights, effectively limiting the capacity of the model and preventing overfitting.

Other popular regularization methods include L1 regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation. L1 regularization, like L2 regularization, introduces a penalty term but uses the absolute value of the weights instead of their square. Early stopping involves monitoring the validation error during training and halting the process once the error starts increasing, indicating that the model has begun to overfit. Data augmentation generates additional training samples by applying transformations to existing ones, thereby artificially expanding the dataset and reducing overfitting.
