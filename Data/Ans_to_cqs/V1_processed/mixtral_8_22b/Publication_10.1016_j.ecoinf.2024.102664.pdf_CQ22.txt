In this study, two main metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2). These metrics help assess how well the forecasted chlorophyll (Chl) concentrations match with the actual satellite observations.

Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): This metric measures the difference between the predicted and actual values. It is calculated by taking the square root of the mean of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values. Lower RMSE values indicate better model performance. In Table 1, RMSE values are given in units of micrograms per liter (Âµg/L).

Coefficient of Determination (R2): Also known as the R-squared value, this metric represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variables in a regression model. Higher R2 values suggest a stronger relationship between the predicted and actual values. In Figure 3, R2 values are shown for different models and locations (points A, B, and C).

These metrics are used to compare the performance of three deep learning models: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and a hybrid CNN-LSTM model. Based on these evaluations, it was found that the hybrid CNN-LSTM model generally performed best, achieving higher R2 values and lower RMSE compared to the other models.
