The given text does not provide information on regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. Instead, it discusses various methods for evaluating the accuracy of maps produced by calibrated statistical prediction methods when limited data is available. These include using a training set, a validation set, and a test set, as well as resampling methods like leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) and other forms of cross-validation. The text also mentions the use of a two-dimensional kernel approach and LOESS smoothing parameter for transforming observed conventional cross-validation residuals.
