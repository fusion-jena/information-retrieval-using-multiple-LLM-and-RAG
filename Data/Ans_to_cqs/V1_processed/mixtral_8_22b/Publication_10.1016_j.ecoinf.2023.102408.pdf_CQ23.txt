To ensure the generalizability of their deep learning models, several measures were implemented. Firstly, a diverse set of variables was considered during the initial development of the model. These variables were evaluated using variable importance measures to determine their significance in predicting Above Ground Biomass (AGB). This process helped identify the most influential variables for accurate predictions.

Secondly, a stratified sampling method was applied to all AGB observations for evaluating the performance of the model. This technique involved randomly allocating 70% of the samples to the training dataset and the remaining 30% to the validation dataset. By employing such a split, the model could be trained on a representative subset of data while also being tested on unseen data to gauge its ability to generalize well.

Lastly, three error statistics – R², Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) – were utilized to compare the accuracy of different models. These metrics allowed researchers to quantify how well each model performed and select the best one based on these results.

In summary, the authors took multiple steps to guarantee the generalizability of their deep learning models. They started by considering various relevant variables and determining their significance through variable importance measures. Then, they adopted a stratified sampling approach to create separate datasets for training and validating the models. Finally, they compared the performance of different models using established error statistics to choose the most suitable one.
