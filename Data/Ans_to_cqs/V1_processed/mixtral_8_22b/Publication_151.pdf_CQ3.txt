The provided context does not directly discuss specific data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Instead, it focuses on aspects related to phylogenetic analysis using deep learning approaches like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

In this context, the authors mention using simulated data sets for training their CNN model. They generate these datasets using complex models to sample data on known trees, which are then used to train the model. This methodology is referred to as a semisupervised approach, involving classification of input data into three possible quartet topologies and combining them to create the final output.

While the text does not explicitly state any traditional data annotation techniques, it highlights the use of simulation-based data generation for training deep learning models in the field of phylogenetics. It also mentions potential issues with this approach, such as missing relevant parts of the huge parameter space and model misspecification.
