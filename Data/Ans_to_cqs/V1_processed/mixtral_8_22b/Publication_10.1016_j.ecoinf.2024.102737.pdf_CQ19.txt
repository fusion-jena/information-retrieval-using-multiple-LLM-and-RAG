The text does not explicitly mention which deep learning framework was used to build the models. However, it mentions that the implementations are taken from the open sources of Choi, (2020); Siyah, (2020). This suggests that the authors might have used the same framework as those used in these references. Without further information, it cannot be definitively stated which framework was used.
