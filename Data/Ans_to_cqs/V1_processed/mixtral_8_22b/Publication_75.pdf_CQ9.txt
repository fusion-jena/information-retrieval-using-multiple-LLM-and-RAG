Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it does mention that the Canadian dataset is publicly available, but it doesn't provide any specific link or reference to its location. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based solely on the given context.
