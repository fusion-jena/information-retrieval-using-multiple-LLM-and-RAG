The article mentions that the performance of the model was evaluated both internally and externally. For internal evaluation, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were used for each individual algorithm, ranging from 75% to 85%. The average ROC value across the ensemble was 71%. For external evaluation, the 2013 Presence/Absence data cube was mapped onto the rasterized heatmap. Visual assessment was done by comparing actual presence/absence data points to predicted Relative Importance Output (RIO) scores. The alignment of these two indicated a robust, moderate-high model performance. However, the article does not explicitly mention the use of specific metrics like accuracy, precision, or recall for evaluating the performance of the deep learning model.
