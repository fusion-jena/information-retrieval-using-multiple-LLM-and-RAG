The paper by C. Zhang et al. mentions the use of a dataset containing clean bird sounds for their experiments. They obtained a dataset consisting of 1568 clean bird sound segments, with durations ranging from 4 to 20 seconds. From this dataset, they randomly selected 68 segments as the clean bird sound test set. However, the name or source of this specific dataset is not mentioned in the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide further details about the origin or characteristics of this dataset beyond what has been stated here.
