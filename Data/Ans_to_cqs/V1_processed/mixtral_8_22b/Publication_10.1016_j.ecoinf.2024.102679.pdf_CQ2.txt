In the provided context, it appears that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images. Specifically, the text mentions that there are 190,686 images saved in 6000 x 4000 pixels JPEG format. These images are then processed using the HerdNet deep learning architecture, which is specifically designed for processing aerial survey images. Therefore, based on the available information, we can conclude that the data format used in this particular deep learning pipeline is primarily images.
