Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Instead, the focus appears to be on birdsong classification using the 2021 BirdCLEF dataset, where the recordings are weakly labeled. The authors have used randomly selected chunks of 5 seconds duration for the training process, some of which may include non-bird audio events like wind, thunder, or aircraft sounds. They have also incorporated additional noise from the AudioSet dataset to diversify their non-bird audio events. Furthermore, they have examined the audio quality of the clips and extracted those without birdsong from the validation soundscape recordings based on metadata. These clips were then added as background noise to the training data. Therefore, while the context does not provide details about traditional data annotation techniques, it discusses the handling of weak labels and incorporating relevant background noise into the training data for improved birdsong classification.
