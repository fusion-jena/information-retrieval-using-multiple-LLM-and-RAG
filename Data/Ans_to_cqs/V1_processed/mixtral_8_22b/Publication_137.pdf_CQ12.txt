In the given context, the deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly mentioned as either a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer. However, there are some clues that suggest the usage of specific models.

Firstly, the text mentions using a deep neural network for processing data. This could refer to any type of deep learning model, including CNNs, RNNs, or Transformers. Secondly, the mention of PointNet suggests that the model might be related to processing point cloud data, which is often associated with tasks like object detection, classification, and segmentation.

Furthermore, the context also refers to using Graph Convolution Network (GCN) for segmenting point clouds based on context. GCNs are typically used for processing graph-structured data, such as social networks or molecular structures. They can also be applied to point cloud data, where points are treated as nodes in a graph, and their relationships are represented by edges.

Lastly, the context mentions using PyTorch as the deep learning framework. PyTorch supports various types of deep learning models, including CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers. However, without more explicit information about the architecture of the deep learning model used in the pipeline, it is difficult to definitively determine whether it is a CNN, RNN, or Transformer.
