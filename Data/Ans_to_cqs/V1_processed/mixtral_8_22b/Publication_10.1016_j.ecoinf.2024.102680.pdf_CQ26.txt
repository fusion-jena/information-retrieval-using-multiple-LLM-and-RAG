Based on the given context, it appears that the authors use several techniques to improve the quality and representation of their input data during the preprocessing stage of their deep learning pipeline. However, none of these techniques specifically addresses data bias through methods like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Instead, they focus on enhancing the overall quality of the input data.

Specifically, the authors mention performing preprocessing operations on initial images, including resizing them to the required size and applying algorithms such as mosaic data augmentation. Resizing the images ensures consistency in the dimensions of the input data, which helps maintain uniformity across different samples. Data augmentation techniques, like mosaic augmentation, help generate new training examples from existing ones by combining multiple images together. This process increases the diversity of the dataset and improves the robustness of the trained models.

Additionally, the authors discuss using dilated convolution and depthwise separable convolution to overcome issues related to overwhelming computational complexity when employing large kernel convolutions. By incorporating these techniques, they aim to reduce the number of network parameters and computational load while still maintaining a larger receptive field for the convolutional kernels.

Overall, while the authors do not explicitly mention addressing data bias through specific techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, they do emphasize the importance of enhancing the quality and representation of input data during preprocessing.
