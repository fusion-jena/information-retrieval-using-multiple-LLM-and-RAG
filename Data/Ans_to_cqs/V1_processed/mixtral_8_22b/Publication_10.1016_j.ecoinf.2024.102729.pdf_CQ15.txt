Unfortunately, based on the provided context, there is no specific mention of optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). Therefore, I am unable to provide a helpful answer to this query with the current information.
