After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be taken to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the model. These include accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrices, among others. Specifically, the use of confusion matrices provides detailed information about both correct and incorrect classifications made by the model. This valuable insight enables identifying potential deficiencies in classifying specific classes or categories. The evaluation results are presented through figures and numerical data, where graphical visualizations effectively portray the performance estimation achievements. Additionally, saliency maps may also be used to understand which features contribute most significantly to the predictions made by the model.
