The text does not provide explicit details about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the optimal model was determined based on the minimum delta.AICc value, which suggests that some form of model selection or evaluation process was used. Additionally, the use of cross-validation is mentioned when deriving the threshold from the average output of five models. This indicates that the model was tested on different subsets of data to assess its performance and avoid overfitting. While these are common practices to enhance the generalizability of a model, the text does not explicitly state whether diverse datasets or stratified splitting techniques were utilized.
