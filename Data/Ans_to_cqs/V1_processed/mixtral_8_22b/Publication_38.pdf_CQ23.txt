Based on the given context, there isn't explicit mention of specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, some potential indicators can be inferred. For instance, the use of diverse datasets could be implied through the reference to various sources such as citizen science projects, which often involve multiple contributors and locations. This diversity might contribute to the robustness and applicability of the model across different scenarios. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of a large dataset containing over 1 million recordings, which could help improve the model's ability to generalize. Furthermore, the inclusion of references to works related to bird identification tasks and real-time bioacoustic monitoring suggests that the authors may have considered aspects relevant to ensuring the model's performance across varied conditions. Nevertheless, without more direct evidence or explicit statements regarding techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting, it remains uncertain what exact steps were taken to guarantee the model's generalizability.
