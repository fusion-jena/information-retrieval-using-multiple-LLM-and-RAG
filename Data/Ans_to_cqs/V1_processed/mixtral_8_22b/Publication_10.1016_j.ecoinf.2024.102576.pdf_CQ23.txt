Based on the given context, it appears that the study employs a deep learning model, specifically the U-Net model, for land-cover classification. While the context does not explicitly mention specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, some common practices in machine learning could potentially apply here. These include using diverse datasets, cross-validation, and stratified splitting.

Diverse datasets help improve the model's ability to generalize by exposing it to a wide range of examples during training. Cross-validation involves dividing the available data into subsets or folds, where the model is trained on one subset and tested on another. This process is repeated until all subsets serve as test sets. It helps assess how well the model will perform on unseen data.

Stratified splitting ensures that the distribution of classes in the train and test sets remains similar to their original proportions in the entire dataset. This technique prevents any bias towards certain classes due to imbalanced representation in either set.

However, without explicit details about the methods employed in this particular study, we cannot definitively state whether these techniques were utilized. Further research or access to the complete study would provide more clarity on this matter.
