The given context does not provide information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses various aspects related to land use and land cover classification using remote sensing datasets and machine learning algorithms like Random Forest. The study uses spectral indices such as NDVI, EVI, SAVI, BSI, MNDWI, and NDMI, along with different combinations of input features from multiple datasets. It also describes a sampling strategy for defining training and testing samples, which involves considering at least 50 pixels per thematic class and implementing simplified random sampling. Unfortunately, there is no mention of any data annotation techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation in the provided context.
