The given context does not provide information about the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It only mentions that deep learning models were considered but ultimately, the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm was chosen for developing a model for Fv/Fm parameter estimation. Therefore, based on the provided context, it cannot be determined what type of deep learning model would have been used if one had been selected.
