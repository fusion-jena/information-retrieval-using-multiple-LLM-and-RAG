Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available in the given context to determine which specific frameworks were used to build the deep learning model. The text mentions using artificial neural networks and deep learning techniques but does not provide details about the programming languages or libraries employed during development. Therefore, it cannot be definitively stated whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other particular framework was utilized.
