The code repository link for the deep learning pipeline can be found at <https://github.com/BenMcEwen1/Sparse-Noise-Reduction>. This repository contains the implementation of the Conditional Masked Generative Adversarial Network (CMGAN) model used for sparse noise reduction in bioacoustic signals. It includes the necessary scripts and instructions to train and test the model on various datasets. Additionally, it provides access to the pretrained models and sample input files for quick experimentation.
