Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning models, such as the learning rate or the type of optimizer employed. However, it does mention that all deep learning-based models were implemented using TensorFlow and that they were trained with the same optimizer and learning rates. This suggests that the authors might have used default values for some hyperparameters or did not find it necessary to report them explicitly in their research.
