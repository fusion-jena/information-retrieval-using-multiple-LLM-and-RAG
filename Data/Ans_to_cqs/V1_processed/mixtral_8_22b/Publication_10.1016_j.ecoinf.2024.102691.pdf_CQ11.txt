Unfortunately, there isn't enough context provided to determine the specific data repository link of the deep learning pipeline mentioned in this study. However, it can be noted that the authors have cited several relevant studies related to agricultural robotics, deep learning, and ecological informatics. These citations may provide further insights into similar research and potentially lead to discovering the desired data repository links.

To find the data repository link, one could search for the referenced papers and check if they contain any links to datasets or code repositories. For instance, the paper by Capinha et al. (2021) might offer valuable resources regarding deep learning for supervised classification of temporal data in ecology. Similarly, Chen et al.'s work (2021) focuses on an apple detection method based on des-YOLO v4 algorithm for harvesting robots in complex environments, which could also include useful dataset or code references.

However, without more explicit information about the specific deep learning pipeline discussed in this context, it is impossible to pinpoint the exact data repository link. I recommend searching for the referenced papers and exploring their respective datasets and code repositories to gain a better understanding of the topic and possibly locate the required data repository link.
