The context does not provide specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipelines mentioned. However, it mentions a targeted fish species dataset that was divided into training and validation sets in an 8:2 ratio using a random selection process. It also references papers that discuss various aspects of deep learning, such as high-resolution monitoring of fish length and catch numbers from landings using deep learning, a deep learning approach to photo-identification for multiple cetacean species, and a fish detection method based on multi-enhancement and output fusion of fuzzy underwater images. These studies may have utilized different datasets relevant to their respective research topics. Unfortunately, without explicit mention of the datasets used in these deep learning pipelines, we cannot definitively state which ones were employed.
