The given context does not provide information on the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine which optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) have been applied.

The context primarily focuses on the application of Random Forest Classification, a machine learning technique based on decision trees and bootstrapping, for mapping coastal and seagrass habitats. It mentions two sets of RF models being performed using multispectral images but does not discuss any details about the deep learning pipeline or the optimization techniques employed within it.
