After the model training, there are several postprocessing steps that can be taken depending on the specific requirements of the project or analysis. Some common postprocessing steps include calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate the performance of the model. Another common step is creating confusion matrices to visualize the performance of the model in terms of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. Additionally, saliency maps can also be generated to highlight the most important features or inputs that contribute to the predictions made by the model. However, it should be noted that these postprocessing steps may vary based on the type of machine learning algorithm used and the specific goals of the project. In summary, some possible postprocessing steps after model training could include calculating metrics, generating confusion matrices, and creating saliency maps.
