The text does not explicitly mention specific techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the issue of imbalanced datasets affecting the performance of classifier models. One approach mentioned to tackle this problem is through the generation of synthetic data records, which can help increase both the quantity and quality of the original real-world datasets. The process involves dividing the development dataset into a training dataset and a tuning dataset, followed by employing k-fold cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning due to its benefits in enhancing the model's generalization ability. Although the text doesn't directly state the use of diverse data collection, generating synthetic data records from real data records could be considered a form of diversifying the dataset.
