The authors used several data augmentation techniques to address overfitting and manage data imbalance. These techniques include rotation 45 degrees, adding Gaussian noise, horizontal/vertical flipping, contrast enhancement, sharpening of images, zoom range [0.7,1.3], and affine transformations. Each bird species' images were augmented ten times, including the original bird images.
