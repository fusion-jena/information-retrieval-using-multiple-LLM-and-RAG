The dataset is divided into training sets, which comprise 80% of the data, and a test set representing the remaining 20%. This division is done by random sampling to ensure that both subsets are representative of the overall dataset and minimize the risk of bias. Randomization helps to preserve the distribution of key features and target variables across both training and test sets, enhancing the generalizability of the model. Additionally, a five-fold cross-validation is used during the hyperparameter optimization process.
