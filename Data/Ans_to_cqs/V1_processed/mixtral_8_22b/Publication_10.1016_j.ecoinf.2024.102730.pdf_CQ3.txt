The given context does not provide specific information on the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge about deep learning pipelines, some common data annotation techniques include:

1. Bounding Box Annotation: This technique involves drawing a rectangle around the object of interest in an image. It is commonly used for object detection tasks where the goal is to identify the location of objects within images.

2. Instance Segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image with a class label and an instance ID. It is useful for identifying individual instances of objects within an image.

3. Semantic Segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image with a class label but without distinguishing between different instances of the same class. It is useful for understanding the overall structure of an image.

4. Polygon Annotation: This technique involves drawing polygonal shapes around objects of interest in an image. It is useful for accurately outlining complex shapes.

5. Key Point Annotation: This technique involves placing dots or points on key features of an object in an image. It is useful for tasks such as pose estimation or facial landmark detection.

Without more specific context, it is impossible to determine which of these techniques were used in the deep learning pipeline described in the given context.
