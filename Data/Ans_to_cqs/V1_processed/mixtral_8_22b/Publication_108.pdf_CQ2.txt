Based on the given information, the deep learning pipeline primarily uses image data. Specifically, high-resolution orthophotos with 20-cm spatial resolution obtained from an aerial survey are utilized. These orthophotos are processed into smaller labeled tiles or image cubes of 256 x 256 pixels each. Therefore, the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is image data.
