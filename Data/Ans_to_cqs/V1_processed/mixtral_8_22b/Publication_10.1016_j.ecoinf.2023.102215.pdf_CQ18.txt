The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is by using the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss function. This loss function measures the difference between the predicted probability and the actual value. Minimizing this difference indicates a better training effect. The specific BCE loss function used in this case is expressed as L\_BCE = \sum\_{x=1}^{H} \sum\_{y=1}^{W} [G(x, y)\log{Spre}(x, y) + (1 - G(x, y))\log{(1 - Spre)(x, y)}], where (x,y) is the pixel coordinate, H and W are the height and width of the image, respectively, G is the ground-truth, and Spre is the final predicted saliency map.
