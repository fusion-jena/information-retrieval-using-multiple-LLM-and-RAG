The text does not provide information about specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the authors used a bug-picture database and trained their algorithms on a subset of this dataset. They also mention using stochastic gradient descent with momentum optimizer for training, but they do not specify any particular data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot determine which data augmentation techniques were applied in the deep learning pipeline.
