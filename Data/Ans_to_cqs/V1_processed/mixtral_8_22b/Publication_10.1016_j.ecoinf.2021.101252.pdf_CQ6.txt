Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be applied to improve its performance. These may include:

1. Normalization: This involves rescaling the input features so they have a mean of zero and standard deviation of one. It helps to speed up the learning process and prevent any single feature from dominating the others due to its scale.

2. Scaling: Similar to normalization, scaling adjusts the values of numeric columns to a common scale, but instead of centering around zero, it scales them between a specific range (e.g., 0-1 or -1 to 1). This is particularly useful when dealing with different units of measurement.

3. Cleaning: This refers to handling missing values, outliers, and noisy data. Missing values can be replaced with statistical measures like mean, median, mode, or imputation techniques. Outliers can be detected and removed if necessary, while noise reduction can be achieved through various filtering techniques.

4. Encoding: For categorical variables, encoding converts textual categories into numerical form. Common encoding techniques include label encoding, one-hot encoding, and ordinal encoding.

5. Feature Selection: Selecting relevant features can help reduce dimensionality, decrease training times, and improve overall model performance. Techniques such as correlation matrix, mutual information, chi-square test, or recursive feature elimination can be used for feature selection.

6. Augmentation: Data augmentation generates new samples by applying transformations to existing ones. This technique can increase the size of the dataset and introduce more variability, helping the model generalize better.
