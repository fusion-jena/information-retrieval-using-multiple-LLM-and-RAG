The text does not provide specific details about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of NAIP (National Agriculture Imagery Program) imagery and massive training datasets. It also suggests the incorporation of information from online spectral libraries or other remote sensing products. The authors emphasize the importance of high-quality input data for accurate results when applying machine learning methods for image classification tasks. They discuss the limitations of using historical imagery due to its variable characteristics such as blurriness and distortion. Additionally, they propose the use of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for the four-band imagery to aid in classification.
