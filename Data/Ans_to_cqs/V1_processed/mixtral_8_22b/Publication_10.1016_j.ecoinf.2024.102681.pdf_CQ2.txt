The text does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is primarily used to process gridded data of a fixed size, which could imply that the data used in this study might be in a grid or matrix format. Additionally, the text states that CNN is highly suitable for processing data such as images, sounds, and time series, suggesting that any of these types of data could potentially be used in the deep learning pipeline. Furthermore, the study employs a sliding window method with a window size of 30 years and a step size of one year, indicating that the data may be in a time series format. Therefore, while the exact data format cannot be determined from the given context, it can be inferred that the data used in the deep learning pipeline could be in a grid/matrix format, time series format, or possibly other formats like images or sound files.
