Regularization methods are techniques used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise along with underlying patterns, which can lead to poor generalization performance on unseen data. Two common regularization methods mentioned in the given context are dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent complex co-adaptations on training data. This forces the network to learn more robust features that are useful in conjunction with many different random subsets of the other neurons. Dropout effectively approximates training a large number of neural networks with different architectures in parallel.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of all the weights in the network. By adding this penalty, the optimizer tries to minimize not only the original loss but also the sum of squared weights. This encourages smaller weights, leading to simpler models that are less likely to overfit.

These regularization methods help improve the generalization performance of deep learning models by reducing their complexity and preventing them from memorizing the training data.
