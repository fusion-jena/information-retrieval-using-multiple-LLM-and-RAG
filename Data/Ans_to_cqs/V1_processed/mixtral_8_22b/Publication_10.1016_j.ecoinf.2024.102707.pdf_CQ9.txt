The authors have mentioned that they made their training data publicly available along with the code used in the analysis and the trained machine learning model. However, they do not specify where exactly the data has been deposited or shared. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a specific location such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. It would be best to contact the corresponding author directly to request access to the data repository.
