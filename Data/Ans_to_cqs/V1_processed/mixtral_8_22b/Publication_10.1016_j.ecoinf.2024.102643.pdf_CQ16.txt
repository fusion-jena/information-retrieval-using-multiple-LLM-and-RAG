The text does not provide explicit information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, it mentions that the collected data was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) datasets, which suggests that some form of evaluation or validation process was employed during the modeling phase. Commonly used criteria to determine when training is complete include reaching a certain number of epochs, achieving a desired level of accuracy, or observing a plateau in the validation loss. In this case, since the models were evaluated based on their performance and accuracy using metrics such as AUC and TSS, it can be inferred that these metrics might have been used to assess the completion of training. Nevertheless, without more detailed information about the training process, it is not possible to definitively state what criteria were used to determine when training was complete.
