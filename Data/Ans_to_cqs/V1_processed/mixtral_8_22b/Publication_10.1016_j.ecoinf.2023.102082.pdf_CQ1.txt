The text mentions several sources of raw data used in the deep learning pipeline for generating high-resolution Canopy Height Models (CHMs) and other applications related to forest ecosystem monitoring. These include:

1. Optical Images: The study uses Sentinel-2 optical images as input for their deep learning approach utilizing convolutional neural networks. These satellite images provide valuable information about the Earth's surface, including forests and vegetation structures.

2. Active Remote Sensing Data: Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) data is also mentioned as being integrated into the deep learning pipeline. This active remote sensing dataset provides detailed measurements of forest vertical structure, such as canopy height and aboveground biomass.

3. Passive Remote Sensing Data: Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery is another source of data used in conjunction with GEDI data to generate global forest canopy height maps. This passive remote sensing data offers insights into land cover changes and vegetation health over time.

4. Public Datasets: While not explicitly stated in the given context, it is worth noting that many studies rely on publicly available datasets to train and validate their deep learning models. For instance, the authors might have used existing benchmark datasets or open-source repositories containing relevant remote sensing data.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline described in the context primarily utilizes optical satellite images (such as those from Sentinel-2) and active/passive remote sensing data (like GEDI and Landsat 8 OLI) to collect raw data for various applications, including generating high-resolution CHMs and monitoring forest ecosystems globally.
