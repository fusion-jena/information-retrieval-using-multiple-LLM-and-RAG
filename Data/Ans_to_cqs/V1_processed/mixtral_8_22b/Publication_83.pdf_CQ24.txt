Unfortunately, none of the given context mentions any specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. The information provided discusses the use of deep learning architectures like VGG style networks and SubSpectralNet for bird sound classification, along with details about their implementation, training parameters, and experimental results. It also touches upon handling variable lengths of audio files by repeating signals or resizing them to fit fixed durations. However, there is no mention of addressing randomness within the deep learning process itself.
