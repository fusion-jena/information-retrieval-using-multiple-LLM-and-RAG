The text does not provide information about the specific data repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The authors mention using a new dataset called UGE-D (Urban Green Extraction Dataset) to train their GVI-learning model but do not give any details regarding where this dataset can be accessed or downloaded. Therefore, without additional context or information, it is impossible to determine the exact data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in this research.
