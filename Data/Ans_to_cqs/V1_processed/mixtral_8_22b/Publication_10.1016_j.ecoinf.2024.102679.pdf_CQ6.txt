Based on the given context, there isn't specific information about the preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model. However, common practices in deep learning include various preprocessing techniques such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization involves rescaling the input features so they fall within a certain range, often between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. Scaling adjusts the values of numeric columns to a standard scale without distorting differences in ranges or units. Cleaning refers to handling missing values, outliers, and irrelevant data points. These preprocessing steps help improve the accuracy and efficiency of the deep learning models.
