The information provided does not explicitly state the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the context that the primary data format used is likely image data. This is because the text discusses the use of satellite images for analysis and mentions techniques such as image classification and resampling of image bands. Additionally, the use of Random Forest, a popular machine learning algorithm often applied to image data, further supports this assumption. Therefore, while not directly stated, it can be reasonably assumed that the main data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data.
