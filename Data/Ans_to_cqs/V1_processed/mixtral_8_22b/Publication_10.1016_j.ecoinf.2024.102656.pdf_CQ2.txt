The information provided does not explicitly mention the use of any specific data format in a deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the study uses raster data formatted in ArcGIS v.10.4, which is likely used for geospatial analysis. Additionally, the study mentions using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images, suggesting that image data may also be utilized in their research. Without further context or details about the deep learning pipeline, it cannot be definitively stated what other types of data formats might be involved.
