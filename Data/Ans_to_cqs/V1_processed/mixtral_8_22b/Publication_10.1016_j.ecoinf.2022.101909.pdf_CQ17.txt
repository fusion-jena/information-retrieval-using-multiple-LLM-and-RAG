In the given context, there is mention of using the dropout regularization method to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. Dropout is a commonly used regularization technique in neural networks where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to prevent complex co-adaptations on training data. This technique is mentioned in the context as being used to reduce overfitting and imitate the training of a set of different models. Other common regularization techniques include L1 and L2 regularization, but these are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
