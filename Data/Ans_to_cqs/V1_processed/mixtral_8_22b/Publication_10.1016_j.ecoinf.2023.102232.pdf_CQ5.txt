Based on the provided context, it does not explicitly mention any specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in the deep learning pipeline. Instead, it discusses the use of a hybrid MCMC algorithm and a genetic algorithm for generating and analyzing parameter values. These algorithms utilize a database containing combinations of best fit values, which are further processed through multiple iterations of the genetic algorithm. The results of these computations are then evaluated based on their ability to accurately represent field data when incorporated into the model. Therefore, without additional information, I cannot provide details about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
