The provided context does not directly discuss the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does mention several aspects related to data preparation and handling in the context of big data processing and FAIR principles.

From the given information, we can infer that the workflow involves data classification and spatio-temporal aggregation, which could potentially include various preprocessing techniques like normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Additionally, the text mentions that the precision of the workflow's output depends on factors such as the completeness of input vessel data, the update rate of the Global Record of Stocks and Fisheries (GRSF), the completeness of Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) data, and the suitability of the selected spatial resolution for the analysis.

While these points do not explicitly outline the preprocessing steps required before training a deep learning model, they highlight the importance of ensuring high-quality, complete, and relevant data for any modeling task. Therefore, based on the provided context, one might assume that similar preprocessing steps would apply here, including data cleaning, normalization, and scaling, depending on the nature of the dataset and the requirements of the deep learning algorithm being employed.
