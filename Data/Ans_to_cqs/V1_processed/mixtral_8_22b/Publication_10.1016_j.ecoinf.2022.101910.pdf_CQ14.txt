The text does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, it mentions that the main adjustable parameters in BirdNET are the detection sensitivity, overlap of prediction segments, and the minimum confidence threshold. These parameters were set to specific values (1.5, 1.5 seconds, and 0.4, respectively). This suggests that the optimization process might have involved manual tuning or a simple parameter sweep rather than more sophisticated techniques like grid search or random search. Nevertheless, without further details, we cannot definitively determine the exact method used for hyperparameter optimization.
