Unfortunately, based on the given information, it is not possible to determine which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. None of the sources mentioned provide details about the deployment environment or any cloud service providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
