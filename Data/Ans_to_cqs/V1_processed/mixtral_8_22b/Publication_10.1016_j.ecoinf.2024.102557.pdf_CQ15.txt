The papers cited do not explicitly mention specific optimization techniques used within their deep learning pipelines. However, some common optimization techniques used in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). These techniques help minimize the loss function during training, allowing the model to learn from its mistakes and improve over time. Other popular optimization techniques include Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp) and Adagrad. The choice of optimization technique depends on factors such as convergence speed, memory requirements, and computational efficiency.
