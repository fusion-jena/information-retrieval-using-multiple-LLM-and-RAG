The text does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the models were optimized, such as through methods like grid search or random search. However, it mentions that they built four ensemble models, each using an averaging approach with a different combination of component models. They also mention including the best-performing models based on AUC for the optimized ensemble model. This suggests that some form of hyperparameter tuning might have been done to select the best-performing models, but the specific method is not mentioned.
