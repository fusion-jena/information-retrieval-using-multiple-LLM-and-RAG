The paper does not provide explicit information about the specific hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer used in their deep learning model. However, they do mention using techniques like focal loss and overlap sampling which can influence the performance of the model. They also discuss using various architectures like YoloV5, RetinaNet, DETR, and Faster R-CNN with different modifications. For instance, they use a combination of YoloV5 with focal loss and another one with a classification layer. Similarly, they employ Faster R-CNN with an overlap sampler. These details suggest that the authors have experimented with different configurations and settings but the exact hyperparameter values remain undisclosed in the given context.
