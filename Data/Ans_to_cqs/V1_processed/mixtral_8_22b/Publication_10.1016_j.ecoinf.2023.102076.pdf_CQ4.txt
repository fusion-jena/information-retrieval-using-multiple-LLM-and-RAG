The given context does not provide explicit information on the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that data augmentation can improve the identification of less frequent topics and alleviate issues related to imbalanced classes in the dataset. One technique mentioned indirectly is oversampling of the minority class, which involves creating additional instances of the underrepresented class to balance the dataset. Other common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, and adding noise to images, but these are not explicitly discussed in the provided context.
