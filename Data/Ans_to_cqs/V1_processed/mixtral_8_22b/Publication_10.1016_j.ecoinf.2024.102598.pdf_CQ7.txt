The authors used a 10-fold cross-validation (CV) design to validate their machine learning models. For each run of the cross-validation procedure, they reserved 30% of the forest fire occurrence data as a validation set, with the remaining 70% of the data being used to train the model. This resulted in 50 resulting models, consisting of 10 models for each machine learning algorithm. The use of this rigorous validation methodology followed the method explained by Eskandari et al. (2021).

In summary, the authors used a 10-fold cross-validation design to split their data for deep learning model training. They reserved 30% of the data for validation and used the remaining 70% for training. This process was repeated 10 times for each machine learning algorithm, resulting in 50 total models.
