Unfortunately, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this query as it is not directly addressed in the given context. However, I can tell you that common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and landmark annotation. Each technique has its own use case depending on the specific task and requirements of the project. For example, bounding box annotation is often used for object detection tasks, while semantic segmentation is useful for identifying different classes within an image. Instance segmentation combines both object detection and semantic segmentation to identify individual objects and classify each pixel within those objects. Polygon annotation involves drawing shapes around objects, while key point annotation focuses on marking specific points on an object. Landmark annotation is similar to key point annotation but is typically used for facial recognition tasks.
