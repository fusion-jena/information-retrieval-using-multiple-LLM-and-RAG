The information provided does not explicitly mention where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific location or link to the code repository based solely on this context. It would require additional resources or information to accurately determine its location.

Based on common practices, it could potentially be found on popular platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket, but without further details, I am unable to confirm its exact location.
