The primary dataset mentioned in this context is the ImageNet dataset (Deng et al. 2009), which is a large-scale hierarchical image database containing millions of labeled images belonging to thousands of categories. This dataset has been widely used for various tasks related to object recognition and image classification. In this case, the ImageNet dataset is employed for two main purposes: firstly, to initialize the model weights before training, taking advantage of the fact that the early layers of a CNN often learn general features applicable across different domains; secondly, to perform transfer learning, where the pre-trained weights from the ImageNet dataset are utilized to initialize the weights for the deeper layers of the network, followed by fine-tuning using the smaller annotated herbarium scan dataset until convergence.
