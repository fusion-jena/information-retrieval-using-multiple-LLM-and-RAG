Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, these are common preprocessing techniques often employed when preparing data for use in machine learning models. Normalization can help scale numerical inputs to a similar range, while cleaning may involve removing outliers or handling missing data. Scaling might also be necessary depending on the nature of the dataset. It would be best to refer to additional resources or consult the authors of the paper for more information regarding their specific preprocessing methods.
