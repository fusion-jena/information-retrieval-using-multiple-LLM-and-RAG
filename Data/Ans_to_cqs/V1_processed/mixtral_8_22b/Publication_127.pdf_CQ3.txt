The given context does not provide explicit details about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the study uses "millions of labeled data" and discusses training on the ImageNet dataset, which consists of 1.3 million labeled images for 1,000 categories. These statements suggest that the authors might have employed some form of object detection or classification annotations, such as bounding boxes or class labels, respectively. Additionally, the paper states that the system performs as well as teams of human volunteers, implying that human annotators were involved in creating the labeled dataset. Nevertheless, without more detailed information regarding the nature of these labels, it is impossible to definitively determine the exact data annotation techniques utilized in the deep learning pipeline.
