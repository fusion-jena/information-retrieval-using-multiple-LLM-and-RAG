The pipeline uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model called U2-Net as its base network for feature extraction. This choice was made due to the effectiveness of CNNs in handling spatial data such as images, which makes them suitable for Salient Object Detection (SOD) applications. Additionally, the paper introduces novel components like the Multiscale Information Fusion (MIF) block and the Texture Attention (TA) module to enhance the overall architecture of their proposed model, named TrunkNet.
