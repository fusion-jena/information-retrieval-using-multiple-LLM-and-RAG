In this study, three types of neural network models are fitted using the package mxnet: Simple Neural Network (SNN), Deep Neural Network (DNN), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). These models are used for species distribution modelling. Specifically, the CNN model is described as being composed of two hidden convolutional layers and one last layer fully connected with 200 neurons. It has 64 convolution filters of kernel size (3, 3) and 1 line of 0 padding in the first layer, followed by batch normalization, transformation with a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), and average pooling. The second layer has 128 convolution filters of kernel size (5, 5) and 2 lines of padding, also followed by batch normalization, ReLU, and average pooling. Finally, the output is flattened and fed into a fully connected layer. Therefore, the type of deep learning model used in this pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
