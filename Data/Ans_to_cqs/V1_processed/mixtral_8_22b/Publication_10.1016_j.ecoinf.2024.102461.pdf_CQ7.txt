The text does not provide information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (i.e., train, test, validation sets). However, it mentions that three machine learning algorithms were employed to evaluate fire risk: Support Vector Machine, Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network, and Random Forests. These methods typically require splitting the available data into separate subsets for training, testing, and validation purposes. Common practices include randomly dividing the data into these subsets or employing techniques such as k-fold cross-validation. Without further details from the source material, I cannot provide more specific information regarding the exact criteria used for splitting the data in this case.
