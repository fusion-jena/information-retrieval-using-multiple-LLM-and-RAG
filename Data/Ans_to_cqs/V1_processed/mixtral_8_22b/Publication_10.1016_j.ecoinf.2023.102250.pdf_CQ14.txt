The given context does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, there is mention of Spectral Normalization (Miyato et al., 2018) which is used for achieving Lipschitz continuity by constraining the spectral norm of the weight matrix of each layer of the network in the discriminator. This method is described as being simple, efficient, and not requiring additional hyperparameter tuning. Therefore, based on the available context, it appears that the use of Spectral Normalization may help reduce or eliminate the need for extensive hyperparameter optimization methods such as grid search or random search.
