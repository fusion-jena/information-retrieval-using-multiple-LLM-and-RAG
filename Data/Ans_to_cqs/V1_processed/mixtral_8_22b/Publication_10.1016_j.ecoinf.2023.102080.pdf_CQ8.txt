The information provided does not mention any specific details about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer to this query based on the given context. However, it would be best to check the authors' or publishers' websites or search online platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket using relevant keywords such as 'covsel R package','species distribution modeling', or 'embedded covariate selection'.
