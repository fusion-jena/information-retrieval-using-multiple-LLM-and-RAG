The context does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, based on common machine learning practices, some possible criteria include:

1. Validation Loss Plateau: Training can be considered complete when the validation loss stops decreasing or starts increasing, indicating overfitting. This is often referred to as the early stopping method.

2. Maximum Number of Epochs: Training can also be stopped after reaching a predefined maximum number of epochs, even if the performance has not yet converged.

3. Performance Metrics Threshold: Another criterion could be setting a threshold value for a chosen performance metric (like RMSE or MAE). Once the desired level of accuracy is achieved, training can be terminated.

4. Time Budget: Sometimes, due to resource constraints or time limitations, training might need to stop once a certain amount of time has elapsed.
