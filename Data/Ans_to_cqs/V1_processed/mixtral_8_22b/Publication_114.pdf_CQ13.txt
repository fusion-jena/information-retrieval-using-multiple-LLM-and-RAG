Unfortunately, the given information does not provide details about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning models such as learning rate or optimizer. The table only shows the classification accuracies of three deep learning algorithms - VGG16, ResNet50, and AlexNet. These architectures are known for their unique characteristics but the exact hyperparameters used during training are not mentioned. For instance, VGG16 is known for its simplicity and uniform architecture, while ResNet50 uses residual connections to improve gradient flow. AlexNet was one of the first successful convolutional neural networks, introducing ReLU activation functions and dropout regularization. However, without explicit mention of the hyperparameters used, we cannot determine the exact values for learning rates, optimizers, or any other relevant settings.
