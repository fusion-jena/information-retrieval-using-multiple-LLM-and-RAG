Based on the given context, it appears there is no mention of any specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the context discusses various scientific papers and their respective datasets related to environmental studies in China. These include land use/cover datasets, monthly average air temperature and precipitation data, gridded precipitation and air temperature data, and net land surface radiation data. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline based on the given context.
