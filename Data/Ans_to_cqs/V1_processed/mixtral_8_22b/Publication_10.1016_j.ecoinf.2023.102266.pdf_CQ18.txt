The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, there are some relevant points regarding the model's limitations and potential improvements.

The text mentions that the classification model is based on the Monte Carlo method, which demands extensive computational resources to achieve an adequate level of result confidence. To address this issue, ensuring an ample number of trials is crucial to obtain more precise and reliable estimates. Additionally, exploring innovative variance reduction techniques could help improve the model's accuracy and broaden its applicability in future research and real-world applications.

In terms of applying the model to a real wildfire scenario, the context describes how the model was applied to a wildfire in Vall de Gallinera, considering specific climate conditions for temperature and humidity. However, no information is provided about monitoring the model performance during this process.

Regarding potential improvements to the model, the text suggests modifying the update criterion to maintain stochasticity but make it differentiable. This modification aims to leverage machine-learning tools and transform the model into an intelligent cellular automaton. Furthermore, optimizing the scope by changing the partitions used in each iteration could also enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the model. Lastly, investigating and developing new estimators using variance reduction strategies such as importance sampling, stratified sampling, and Quasi-Monte Carlo methods might further improve the model's performance.

In conclusion, although the provided context does not directly discuss a strategy for monitoring the model performance during training, it highlights several aspects related to improving the model's accuracy, reliability, and applicability. These include increasing the number of trials, employing variance reduction techniques, modifying the update criterion, optimizing the scope, and implementing advanced estimators with reduced variance.
