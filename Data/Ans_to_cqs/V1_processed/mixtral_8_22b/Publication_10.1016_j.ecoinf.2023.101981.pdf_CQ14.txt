The text does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, such as using methods like grid search or random search. However, it mentions that they opted for a larger FFT window size and fitted cow-specific parameters in the model. This suggests that some form of optimization or tuning was performed, but the specific method is not mentioned. Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot definitively state how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized.
