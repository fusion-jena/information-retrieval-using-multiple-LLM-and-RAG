The given context does not provide explicit information about which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it mentions that leveraging cloud computing and machine learning to analyze remotely sensed data has great potential to create novel tools and fill crucial information gaps for invasive species monitoring. It also states that the map of 2020 iceplant locations in Santa Barbara County is an example of such a combination of machine learning, cloud computing, and remotely sensed data analysis. Therefore, we can infer that some form of cloud computing platform was likely used to deploy the deep learning model, but without further details, we cannot determine if it was specifically AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform.
