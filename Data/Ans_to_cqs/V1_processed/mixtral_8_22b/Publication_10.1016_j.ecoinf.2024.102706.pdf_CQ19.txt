Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any specific deep learning framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch being used to build the deep learning model. Instead, the authors have utilized various machine learning models like Multiple Linear Regression, Elastic Net (Enet), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM). These models are built using different Python packages, including Scikit-learn, xgboost, and lightgbm. Therefore, based on the provided context, it cannot be determined which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model since no deep learning models appear to be involved in this research.
