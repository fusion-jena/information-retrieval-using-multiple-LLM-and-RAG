Based on the given information, it can be inferred that the authors have employed a deep learning approach utilizing a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architecture consisting of four layers, each containing 512 neurons. The input data format for this deep learning pipeline isn't explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, considering the application of the model for Species Distribution Models (SDMs), it could potentially involve various types of data such as environmental rasters, satellite images, or time series data. This assumption is further supported by the mention of the GeoLifeCLEF 2023 dataset, which includes diverse data types. Therefore, while not directly stated, the deep learning pipeline might handle multiple data formats like images (satellite images), time series data, and possibly others depending on the nature of the environmental raster data.
