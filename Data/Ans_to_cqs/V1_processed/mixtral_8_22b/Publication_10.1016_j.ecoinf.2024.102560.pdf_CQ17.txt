Regularization methods are techniques used in machine learning and deep learning models to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise along with underlying patterns, resulting in poor generalization performance on new, unseen data. Regularization helps to reduce overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function during optimization, encouraging simpler models with better generalization capabilities. Two common regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines are Dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored or "dropped out" during each iteration of training. This forces the network to distribute the learned information across all neurons rather than depending heavily on specific ones. By doing so, dropout effectively creates an ensemble of smaller networks within the original network, improving its ability to generalize.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the magnitude of weights to the loss function. This encourages smaller weights, leading to simpler models that are less likely to overfit. The strength of the regularization can be controlled by adjusting the regularization parameter, which determines how much emphasis is placed on minimizing the size of the weights compared to minimizing the error on the training set.

In summary, regularization methods like Dropout and L2 regularization help prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines by introducing penalties to the loss function during optimization. These penalties encourage simpler models with improved generalization capabilities, allowing them to perform better on new, unseen data.
