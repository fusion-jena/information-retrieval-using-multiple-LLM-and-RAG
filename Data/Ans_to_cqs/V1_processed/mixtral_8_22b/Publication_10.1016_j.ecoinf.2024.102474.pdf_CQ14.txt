The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using an Optuna-based hyperparameter optimization procedure. Optuna is a next-generation hyperparameter optimization framework that helps automate the process of finding optimal hyperparameters for machine learning models. It uses a tree-structured Parzen estimator algorithm to efficiently explore the space of possible hyperparameters and find the best combination for a given problem. This approach allows for more efficient and effective hyperparameter tuning compared to traditional methods such as grid search or random search.
