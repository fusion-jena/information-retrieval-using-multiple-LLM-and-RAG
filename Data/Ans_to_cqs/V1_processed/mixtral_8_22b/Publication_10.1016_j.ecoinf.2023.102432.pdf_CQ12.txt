The papers cited do not explicitly mention the use of any specific deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers in their methodology. Instead, they focus on Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) algorithms, specifically the MTMI-SMF (Multi-Target Multi-Instance Spectral Mixture Framework) algorithm, which is used for classifying California plant species temporally using airborne hyperspectral imagery and detecting invasive plant species like Brazilian peppertree. The MTMI-SMF algorithm is formulated to work with imperfect data and handles training data that might not perfectly represent the target invader. It groups pixels surrounding a training location that could contain the invader, unlike most machine learning algorithms that require a single pixel to represent a training location. The paper compares MTMI-SMF classification to Random Forest, another popular machine learning approach. Therefore, based on the given context, it cannot be determined what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline.
