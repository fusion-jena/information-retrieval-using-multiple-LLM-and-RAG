One strategy to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, specifically regarding random seed values, is to store seeds for random number generation locally instead of updating them in global memory every time a random number is generated. This approach is mentioned in Algorithm 2, referred to as the Hidden State Projection Kernel, which distinguishes between locally stored variables and those stored in global memory using subscripts LM and GM, respectively. Storing variables like seeds locally reduces the need to update their values in global memory, which typically has a higher read/write latency. This method can potentially decrease overall compute time, especially when generating multiple random numbers during the training process.
