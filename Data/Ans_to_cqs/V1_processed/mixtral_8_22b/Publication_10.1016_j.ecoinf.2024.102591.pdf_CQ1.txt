The text does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of the Google Earth Engine platform, which provides access to various satellite imagery datasets such as Sentinel-2 and Landsat. These datasets could potentially be used as input for the deep learning models. Additionally, the text references several studies that have likely used remote sensing techniques and possibly other sources of data collection such as ground surveys or LiDAR data. Without more explicit information about the specific methods used for data collection, this is the best interpretation we can make based on the given context.
