Based on the given information, it appears that the study primarily uses semantic segmentation as a data annotation technique in their deep learning pipeline. Specifically, they employ the HRNet model for this purpose. Semantic segmentation involves assigning a label or category to every pixel in an image, thus allowing for the identification and classification of objects within the image. This technique differs from bounding box annotation, which only identifies the general location of an object within an image, and instance segmentation, which not only classifies pixels but also distinguishes between individual instances of the same class within an image. However, the specific details regarding how the semantic segmentation is performed, such as whether it is done manually or automatically, are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
