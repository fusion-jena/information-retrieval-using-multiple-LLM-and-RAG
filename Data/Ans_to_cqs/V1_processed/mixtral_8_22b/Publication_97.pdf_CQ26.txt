The papers referenced do not directly discuss specific techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, some general strategies can be mentioned based on common practices in machine learning and deep learning fields. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting is a technique where the dataset is divided into subsets or strata, ensuring each subset maintains the same distribution of classes as the original dataset. This helps maintain balance when partitioning datasets into training, validation, and testing sets.

Oversampling involves duplicating examples from underrepresented classes to achieve better balance within the dataset. Undersampling, conversely, reduces the number of samples from overrepresented classes to create a more balanced dataset. Both these techniques aim to mitigate imbalance issues in the dataset.

Diverse data collection focuses on gathering varied and representative data to ensure the model learns from different scenarios and avoids biases towards certain features or classes. This approach encourages collecting data from various sources, conditions, and environments to improve the robustness and fairness of the trained models.
