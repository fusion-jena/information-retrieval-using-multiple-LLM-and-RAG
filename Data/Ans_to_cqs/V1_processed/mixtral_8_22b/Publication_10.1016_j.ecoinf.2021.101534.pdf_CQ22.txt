The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), average precision (AP) for each sound class, mean average precision (mAP), macro-average AUC for the overall model, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics are commonly used in previous studies and provide insights into the model's ability to accurately identify different sounds within the soundscape recordings. Additionally, precision, recall, and F1 score curves are plotted for each class to examine the class-specific performance and its changes with threshold scores. All these metrics are calculated using the scikit-learn package.
