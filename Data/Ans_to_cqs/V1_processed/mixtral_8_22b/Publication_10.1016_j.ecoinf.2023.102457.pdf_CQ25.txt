The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in this context is primarily focused on feature extraction and classification. More specifically, it aims to contribute to larger data inputs for future training of deep learning models, with the goal of improving individual acoustic discrimination and enabling sustained, non-invasive monitoring of animal populations. In particular, the authors utilized the pre-trained BirdNET model, which is capable of identifying numerous bird species based on sound. This model uses a task-specific architecture derived from Residual Networks (ResNets) and generates embeddings from audio samples. These embeddings are then processed further to create feature vectors. While the authors acknowledge that their use of pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) may have limited the potential performance of using embeddings from neural networks, they also note that higher classification accuracy was observed when using BirdNET compared to other models like VGGish and Wav2Vec 2.0. Ultimately, the objective of these deep learning techniques is to enhance the ability to distinguish between different animals or individuals within a species based on their unique acoustic characteristics.
