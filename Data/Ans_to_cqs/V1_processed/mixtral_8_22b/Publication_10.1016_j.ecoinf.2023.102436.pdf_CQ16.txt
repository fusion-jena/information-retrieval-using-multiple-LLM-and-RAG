The given context does not provide information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, common criteria used in machine learning include validation loss plateau, where training stops once the validation loss has stopped decreasing or improving; early stopping, which involves setting a threshold for the number of epochs without improvement before terminating training; and maximum number of epochs, where training ends after a predetermined number of iterations through the dataset. These criteria help prevent overfitting and ensure optimal model performance.
