Based on the information provided, there isn't any explicit mention of specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, some aspects can still be inferred. For instance, the use of various ecological and atmospheric variables derived from several satellite missions like MODIS, Sentinel-2, Sentinel-5p, the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), and ECOSTRESS suggests a certain level of diversity in the dataset. Furthermore, the application of convolutional layers for feature extraction implies that the model has been designed to capture complex patterns within the data, potentially enhancing its ability to generalize. Nevertheless, without more detailed information about the training process, it remains unclear whether techniques such as cross-validation or stratified sampling were employed to further improve the model's robustness and generalizability.
