Based on the given information, it appears that the dataset was split into a training set and a test set using an 8:2 ratio. The training set consisted of 12,340 samples, while the test set had 3094 samples. Classification models were then constructed using the training set, and their performance was evaluated based on their accuracy on the test set. However, there is no explicit mention of any specific strategies employed to monitor the model performance during training. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the monitoring strategy used during the training process.
