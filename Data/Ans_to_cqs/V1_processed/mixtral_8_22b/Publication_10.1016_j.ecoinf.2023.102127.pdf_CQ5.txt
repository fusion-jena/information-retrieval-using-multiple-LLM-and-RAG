The information provided does not mention any specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it discusses the challenges and methods related to integrating various biodiversity datasets for modeling species distributions using machine learning approaches. It mentions issues with limited data availability, computational limitations, and the need to address biases in datasets. Additionally, it describes techniques for handling dataset-specific weights, factor interactions, and combining multiple presence-only and presence-absence datasets within a Bayesian framework. However, no explicit reference is made to any commonly known deep learning datasets.
