Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, or scaling being applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of a deep neural network for processing data and mentions adjustments made to parameters like training epoch, batch size, and volume size during model training. It also highlights the use of a learning decay rate to gradually decrease the learning rate over time. Therefore, while the text does not provide information about the application of common data augmentation techniques, it does indicate the optimization of various aspects within the deep learning pipeline.
