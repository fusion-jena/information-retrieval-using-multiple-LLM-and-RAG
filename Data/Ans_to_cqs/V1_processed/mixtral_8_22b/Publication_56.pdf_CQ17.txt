The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, it is common practice in deep learning to employ various regularization techniques to mitigate overfitting and improve generalization performance. Regularization methods include weight decay (also known as L2 regularization), dropout, early stopping, and batch normalization. These techniques aim to constrain the complexity of the learned model, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting.

Weight decay (L2 regularization) adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights, encouraging smaller weights and thus simpler models. Dropout randomly sets a fraction of neurons to zero during each iteration of training, effectively creating an ensemble of sub-models and preventing co-adaptation between neurons. Early stopping halts the training process when the validation error stops decreasing, avoiding unnecessary iterations and potential overfitting. Batch normalization scales and shifts the activations of each layer, improving convergence speed and stability while acting as a form of regularization.

In summary, although the provided context does not directly discuss regularization methods for preventing overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, commonly employed techniques include weight decay (L2 regularization), dropout, early stopping, and batch normalization. Each method serves to control the complexity of the learned model and enhance its ability to generalize from the training data to unseen examples.
