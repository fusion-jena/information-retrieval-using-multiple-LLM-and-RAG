In the given context, there isn't any explicit mention or discussion about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing the impact of random seed values. However, based on general practices in machine learning and deep learning, some common strategies to manage randomness include:

1. Fixed Random Seeds: One popular method is setting fixed random seeds during training, which ensures consistent results across different runs. This helps in reproducing experiments and comparing models effectively.

2. Cross-Validation: Another technique is employing cross-validation, where data is split into multiple folds, and the model is trained and evaluated on these subsets. This reduces the influence of random initialization and improves the robustness of the model.

3. Ensemble Methods: Combining predictions from several independently trained models can also help mitigate the effects of randomness. Techniques like bagging and boosting use this principle to improve overall performance and stability.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and regularization parameters, can reduce the sensitivity of the model to random initializations. Grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization are commonly used methods for hyperparameter tuning.
