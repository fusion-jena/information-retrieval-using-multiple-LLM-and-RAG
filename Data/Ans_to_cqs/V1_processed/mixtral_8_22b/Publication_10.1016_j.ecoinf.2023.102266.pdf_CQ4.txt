The provided context does not discuss any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. Data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, scaling, etc., are commonly used in image processing tasks within deep learning pipelines to artificially expand the dataset size and prevent overfitting. However, the context focuses on improving a model by modifying the update criterion, optimizing the scope, applying machine learning tools, and implementing variance-reduction strategies. It also mentions simulating climatic data using uniform distributions for angle and radius. Unfortunately, without additional context, I am unable to provide details about the specific data augmentation techniques applied in this case.
