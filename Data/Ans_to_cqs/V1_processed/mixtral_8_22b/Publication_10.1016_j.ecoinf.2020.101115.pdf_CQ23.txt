Unfortunately, there isn't enough context provided to directly address the specifics of any deep learning models being used or what measures have been taken to ensure its generalizability. However, I can provide some general insights into common practices used to improve the generalizability of deep learning models.

To ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, it is essential to use diverse datasets during training. This means including various examples representing different aspects of the problem space. For instance, if we are building a computer vision model to classify images of fish, we should include images of fish from different angles, lighting conditions, backgrounds, etc.

Cross-validation is another technique commonly employed to assess the performance of machine learning models, including deep learning ones. It involves dividing the available data into multiple subsets called folds. Each fold serves as a validation set once while the remaining folds form the training set. By repeating this process multiple times, using different folds as the validation set, we get a more robust estimation of our model's performance.

Stratified splitting is a method used when creating these folds to maintain the original distribution of classes in each subset. This ensures that each fold contains roughly the same proportion of instances from each class, preventing imbalanced datasets from affecting the model's performance evaluation.

Again, without further context regarding the specific deep learning model mentioned in the prompt, I cannot provide a detailed response about the exact methods applied to ensure its generalizability.
