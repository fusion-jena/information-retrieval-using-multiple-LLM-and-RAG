Regularization methods are techniques used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. Two commonly used regularization methods are dropout and L2 regularization. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored or "dropped out" during training, which helps to reduce interdependent learning amongst the neurons. This results in a more robust model that performs better on unseen data. On the other hand, L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages large weights and encourages smaller ones. By doing so, it prevents any single feature from having too much influence on the output, thus reducing overfitting. Other regularization methods include early stopping, weight decay, and batch normalization. Early stopping involves monitoring the validation error while training and stopping the process once the error starts increasing. Weight decay is similar to L2 regularization but decays the weights exponentially instead of adding a penalty term. Lastly, batch normalization standardizes the inputs to each layer, making the optimization process easier and faster, thereby preventing overfitting.
