The paper does not provide explicit information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, we can infer that the authors might have serialized their trained models using standard methods such as saving them as.h5 files or converting them into ONNX format. As they used TensorFlow for developing their models, they could have utilized TensorFlow Serving or other platforms like Flask or FastAPI for serving these models. Nevertheless, without specific details mentioned in the paper, we cannot confirm the exact methodology employed for deploying the trained deep learning models.
