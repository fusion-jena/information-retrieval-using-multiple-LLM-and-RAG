The paper does not provide explicit information about the optimization method used for tuning the hyperparameters of the models. Therefore, I cannot give a definitive answer regarding the specific methods like grid search or random search employed for hyperparameter optimization. However, considering common practices in machine learning research, popular techniques include manual tuning, grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and others. Without further details, one can only speculate about the exact approach used in this study.
