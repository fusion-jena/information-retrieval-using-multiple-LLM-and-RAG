The text does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps taken before training a deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that some form of data acquisition and processing must have occurred given that the authors use high-frequency continuous surface water quality data. Typically, preprocessing steps may include data cleaning, handling missing or inconsistent data points, normalizing or standardizing features, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. In this case, the authors do mention that they used randomized subsets of training data, suggesting that their dataset might have undergone partitioning. Additionally, since the authors discuss the effect of measurement uncertainties on chlorophyll-a predictions, it could imply that they took measures to address these uncertainties during preprocessing. Nonetheless, without explicit information about the exact preprocessing techniques applied, one cannot definitively determine what specific steps were undertaken prior to training the deep learning models.
