The text does not provide explicit information about the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it mentions classification accuracy as one metric for evaluating the performance of software incorporating an informative prior in their algorithm. Additionally, it suggests that the number of correct classifications using real-world examples is another important factor in determining the performance of such models. While these are not explicitly stated as evaluation metrics for deep learning models, they do suggest that accuracy and real-world applicability are important considerations when assessing the performance of such models. Other common metrics used to evaluate deep learning models include precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC). These metrics help quantify different aspects of a model's performance, such as its ability to correctly identify positive instances (precision), its sensitivity or true positive rate (recall), and its overall effectiveness (F1 score and AUC). Without more specific information from the given context, however, we cannot definitively state which metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this case.
