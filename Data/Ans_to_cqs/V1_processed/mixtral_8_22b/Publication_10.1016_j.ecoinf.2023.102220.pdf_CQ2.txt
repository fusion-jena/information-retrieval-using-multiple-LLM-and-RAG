The given context does not explicitly mention what type of data format is used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information available, we can infer that the input data might be numerical or categorical since the paper mentions using the ReLU activation function, which is commonly used for numerical inputs. Additionally, the paper uses the sigmoid activation function for the output layer, suggesting binary classification tasks. Therefore, the data could potentially be in a structured format like CSV. However, without explicit confirmation from the authors, this remains speculative.
