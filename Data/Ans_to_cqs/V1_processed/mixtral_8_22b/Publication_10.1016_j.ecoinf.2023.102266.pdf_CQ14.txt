The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, such as through methods like grid search or random search. However, there are several points in the text that suggest possible optimization techniques. For instance, the use of a random seed value implies that different combinations of hyperparameters could be tested to find the best fit. Additionally, the mention of adjustable parameters indicates that the model allows for tuning various aspects to achieve optimal performance. Furthermore, the discussion about increasing the number of cells exposed in each iteration suggests that the model might involve iterative processes where hyperparameters are adjusted over time. Lastly, the reference to machine learning tools hints at the possibility of employing advanced optimization algorithms commonly used in machine learning applications. In conclusion, while the specific optimization technique is not stated, the context provides clues suggesting that the model likely uses some form of hyperparameter tuning, potentially involving iterative processes and machine learning algorithms.
