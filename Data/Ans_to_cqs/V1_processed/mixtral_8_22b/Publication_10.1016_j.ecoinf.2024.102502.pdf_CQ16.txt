Unfortunately, there isn't enough context provided to accurately answer the query about what criteria are used to determine when training is complete. In machine learning, common criteria include reaching a certain number of epochs or iterations, achieving a desired level of performance on a validation set, or observing a plateau in the validation loss. However, without more specific details about the workflow or model being trained, I cannot provide a definitive answer.
