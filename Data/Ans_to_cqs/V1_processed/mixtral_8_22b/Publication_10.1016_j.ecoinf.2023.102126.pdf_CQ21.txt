Based on the given context, there isn't any direct information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training like saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices. However, some insights into the postprocessing steps can be derived indirectly.

After running the F-UJI tool, the results are stored in JSON format containing various details including metric names, results, evaluation scores, debugging messages, and a summary of all metrics in the evaluation. To analyze these results, a computational notebook was utilized to create a report. This report performs three main tasks:

1. Reads JSON responses and collects total scores for the FAIR metric within a data frame.
2. Visualizes the metrics and summarizes the evaluations.
3. Provides an overall analysis and visualization of all PID responses assessed using the F-UJI tool.

These steps indicate that the postprocessing involves reading the output JSON files, collecting relevant scores, and creating visualizations for better understanding and interpretation of the results. Although not explicitly stated, these steps could potentially involve calculating metrics and generating plots similar to those found in other machine learning applications, such as confusion matrices or saliency maps. However, without more explicit information regarding the nature of the models being trained, it cannot be confirmed if these specific techniques would apply directly to this scenario.
