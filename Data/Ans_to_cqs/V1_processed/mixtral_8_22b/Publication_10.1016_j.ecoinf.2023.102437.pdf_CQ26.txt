The given context does not directly discuss specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, some relevant aspects related to data processing and handling can still be identified.

In the context, it mentions the use of Machine Learning (ML) models alongside preselection, which resulted in reduced computational time. Preselection could potentially refer to selecting a subset of features or instances before training the model, although the exact nature of the preselection process isn't specified here. This might indirectly help mitigate certain types of biases if done carefully.

Additionally, the text highlights the impact of the amount of input data on predictive performance. While this doesn't explicitly mention addressing data bias, managing the quantity of input data can sometimes aid in reducing imbalance issues within datasets.

Lastly, the Random Forest (RF) model mentioned in the context is known for being relatively robust against outliers and noise, making it suitable for dealing with noisy or skewed datasets. However, it should be noted that these properties do not necessarily imply direct handling of data bias.

Overall, while the given context does not specifically cover techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, it touches upon aspects related to data management and handling in the context of ML models.
