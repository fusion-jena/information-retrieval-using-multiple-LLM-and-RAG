The purpose of the deep learning model described in this context is for detecting the presence of search-phase bat calls in audio recordings. This is achieved using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) called CNNFULL, which processes spectrogram representations of the audio signals. To improve computational efficiency, another CNN variant called CNNFAST was developed. These models were designed to address the challenge of processing large amounts of data generated through passive acoustic monitoring, while maintaining fast runtime performance.
