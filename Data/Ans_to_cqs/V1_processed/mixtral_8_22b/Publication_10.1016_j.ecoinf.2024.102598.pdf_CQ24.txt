The given context does not provide explicit information about specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it mentions the use of machine learning models (MLMs) for analyzing forest fire occurrences, including Random Forest (RF). To reduce the resulting model's bias, they explicitly set the number of trees to 500 as an additional parameter for RF. Furthermore, they applied a 10-fold cross-validation (CV) design to validate each model after fitting it with optimized parameters. During each CV procedure, they reserved 30% of the forest fire occurrence data as a validation set while using the remaining 70% to train the model. This rigorous validation methodology is essential for ensuring the reliability and robustness of the results obtained from these models. While this process doesn't directly address the management of randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it contributes to creating more stable and accurate models by reducing overfitting and improving generalization capabilities.
