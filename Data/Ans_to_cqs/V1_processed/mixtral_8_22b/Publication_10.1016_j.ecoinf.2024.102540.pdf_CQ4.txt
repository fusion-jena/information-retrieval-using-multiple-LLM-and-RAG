Unfortunately, there is no information provided about the specific data augmentation techniques applied in this deep learning pipeline. Data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, and others are often used to increase the diversity of the training dataset and improve the performance of deep learning models. However, without explicit mention of these techniques being used in this particular study, I cannot provide a definitive answer.
