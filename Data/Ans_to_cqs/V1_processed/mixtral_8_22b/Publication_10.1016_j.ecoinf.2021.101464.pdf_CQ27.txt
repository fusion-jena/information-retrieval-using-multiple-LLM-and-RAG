Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available from the given context to provide a detailed answer about how the trained deep learning model was deployed. However, it can be observed that the random forest (RF) model was implemented using R statistical software (Team RDC, 2010), but no specific details regarding deployment or platform selection have been mentioned.

It should also be noted that the text does not mention any deep learning models being used, only a random forest model. Therefore, I cannot provide information on the deployment process of a deep learning model based on this context.
