The given context does not provide specific information about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that 70% of the data was used for training while the remaining 30% was used for validation. This suggests that stratified sampling might have been employed to ensure that both training and validation sets contain representative samples from all classes.

Stratified sampling is a technique where the dataset is divided into subsets or strata based on certain criteria such as class labels. Then, samples are drawn randomly from each stratum to create the final dataset. This ensures that the resulting dataset has a similar distribution of classes as the original dataset.

Other common techniques to address data bias include oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Oversampling involves duplicating examples from the minority class to balance the dataset, while undersampling removes examples from the majority class. These techniques should be used carefully as they may introduce overfitting or loss of important information.

Diverse data collection aims to collect more data from underrepresented groups or classes to improve the overall representation in the dataset. This approach requires careful consideration of ethical implications and privacy concerns.

In summary, although the given context does not explicitly mention any techniques to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, stratified sampling could have been employed to maintain class balance between training and validation datasets. Other commonly used techniques include oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.
