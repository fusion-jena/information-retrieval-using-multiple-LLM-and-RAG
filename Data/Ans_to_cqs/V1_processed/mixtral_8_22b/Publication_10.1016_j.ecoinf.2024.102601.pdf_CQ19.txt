The text does not provide information about the specific deep learning frameworks used to build the model. However, it mentions the use of scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library in Python, for tasks such as hyperparameter optimization using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV. These methods help improve the performance of the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. Unfortunately, no explicit mention of any deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch was made in the given context.
