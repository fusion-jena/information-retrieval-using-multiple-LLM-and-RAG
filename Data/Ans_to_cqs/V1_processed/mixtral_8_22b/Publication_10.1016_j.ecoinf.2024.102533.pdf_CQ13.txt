The text does not provide information about the use of any deep learning models or their respective hyperparameters such as learning rates or optimizers. This study primarily focuses on using machine learning techniques for clustering based on Euclidean distances to determine fish freshness classes. Therefore, it cannot be determined what hyperparameters were used in a deep learning model since no such model has been mentioned.
