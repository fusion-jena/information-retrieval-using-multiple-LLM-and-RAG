Unfortunately, the given context does not provide explicit details about any specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. Therefore, we cannot definitively state what these steps might be. However, common postprocessing steps in machine learning projects include generating visualizations such as saliency maps or heatmaps, calculating metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score, creating confusion matrices, and performing statistical analysis on the results. These steps help evaluate the performance of the model and gain insights into how well it has learned to classify or predict the desired outputs.
