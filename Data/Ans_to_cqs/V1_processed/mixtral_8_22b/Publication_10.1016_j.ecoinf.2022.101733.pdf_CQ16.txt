The text does not provide explicit information regarding the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions that the samples are divided into training and validation sets according to a 60%-40% ratio. This suggests that the authors might use some form of cross-validation during their model training process. In machine learning, common stopping criteria include reaching a predefined number of epochs, early stopping when the validation loss stops improving, or achieving a target level of performance on the validation set. Given these possibilities, one could infer that the authors may have used similar criteria to decide when their training was complete. Nevertheless, without more specific information, it remains uncertain what exact criteria were employed.
