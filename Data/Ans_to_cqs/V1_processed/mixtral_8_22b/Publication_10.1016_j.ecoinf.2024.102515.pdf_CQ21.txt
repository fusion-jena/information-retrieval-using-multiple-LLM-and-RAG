The given context does not provide explicit details on the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training for biodiversity observations. However, based on general machine learning practices, some common postprocessing steps include evaluating the performance of the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc. Additionally, confusion matrices can be used to visualize the performance of the model, showing true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. Another possible step is generating saliency maps, which highlight important features contributing to the model's predictions. These steps help assess the effectiveness of the model and identify areas for improvement.
