Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization being employed within the described deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the use of multiple loss functions might serve as a form of regularization.

In the context, it is mentioned that the total loss function is a linear combination of three different losses: adversarial loss (Ladv), perceptual loss (Lper), and L1 loss. These combined losses help guide the optimization process during training, potentially preventing overfitting.

While not explicitly stated, one could speculate that the inclusion of these additional loss terms may act similarly to regularization methods like L2 regularization, which adds a penalty term to the loss function based on the magnitude of weights. By incorporating multiple loss components, the overall loss function becomes more complex, encouraging the model to find a balance between minimizing individual losses rather than focusing solely on fitting the data perfectly.

However, without further details regarding the implementation of the deep learning pipeline, it cannot be definitively confirmed if these loss functions indeed serve as regularizers or if other standard regularization methods were also utilized.
