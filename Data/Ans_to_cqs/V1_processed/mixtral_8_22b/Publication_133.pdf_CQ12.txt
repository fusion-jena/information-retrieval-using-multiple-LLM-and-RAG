In the given context, it appears that the authors are discussing the application of deep learning techniques to biological problems involving image classification and extraction of information. They specifically mention two popular approaches - Faster R-CNN and YOLO (You Only Look Once). Both these methods are based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Therefore, we can infer that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is likely a CNN. However, without explicit confirmation or additional details about the specific implementation, we cannot definitively state that only CNNs are being utilized.
