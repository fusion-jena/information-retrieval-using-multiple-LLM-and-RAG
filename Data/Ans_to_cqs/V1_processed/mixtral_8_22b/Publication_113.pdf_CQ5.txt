The text does not explicitly mention the names of the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions using a large dataset for training the embedding model and a smaller target dataset for fine-tuning. It also refers to the eMammal Machine pseudocode and validating the method against the NACTI dataset. Therefore, it can be inferred that the authors used a large unnamed dataset for initial training and two smaller named datasets (eMammal and NACTI) for fine-tuning and validation purposes.
