The main dataset used in the deep learning pipeline for GVI learning is the Urban Green Extraction Dataset (UGE-D). This dataset was specifically created to facilitate GVI extraction and training of the GVI-learning model. Other existing datasets mentioned include COCO-Stuff, Cityscapes, and ADE20K, but they were not explicitly stated as being used in the deep learning pipeline. COCO-Stuff includes 164k well-annotated images, while Cityscapes is a benchmark dataset for the semantic understanding of urban street scenes. ADE20K, on the other hand, is a large-scale dataset for general scene understanding consisting of 150 semantic categories or classes.
