The text does not provide explicit information on the specific process used to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it mentions that TensorFlow, an open-source software platform supporting deep learning research and applications, was utilized and adjusted through Python programming language. This suggests that the deployment might have involved model serialization, where the trained model is saved into a file or files, allowing it to be loaded later without retraining. As for platform selection, since TensorFlow is compatible with various platforms such as CPUs, GPUs, and even mobile devices, the choice would depend on factors like computational power requirements, latency constraints, and hardware availability. Unfortunately, these details are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
