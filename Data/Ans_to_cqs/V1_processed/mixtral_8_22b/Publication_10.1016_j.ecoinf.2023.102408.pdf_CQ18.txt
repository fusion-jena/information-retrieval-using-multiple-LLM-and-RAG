A stratified sampling method was applied to all AGB observations for evaluating the model performance. This technique randomly allocated 70% of the samples to the training dataset and the remaining 30% to the validation dataset. Three error statistics - R^2, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) - were employed to compare the accuracies of the models. These metrics allowed monitoring the model performance during training by providing insights into how well the model fits the data and generalizes to unseen data. Additionally, for the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model, the Nguyen-Widrow method was used to initialize the weights randomly, and the optimum combination of parameters for the best model fit was based on accuracy.
