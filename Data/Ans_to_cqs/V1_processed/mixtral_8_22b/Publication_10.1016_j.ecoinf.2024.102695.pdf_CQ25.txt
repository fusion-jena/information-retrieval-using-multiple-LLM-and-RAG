Based on the given information, the purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated. However, we can infer that the model might be designed for sequence-to-sequence modeling due to its use of the Transformer architecture and the self-attention mechanism. This type of model could be employed for various tasks like machine translation, text summarization, or time series forecasting. In this case, since the model deals with multivariate inputs and univariate outputs, it may be utilized for time series forecasting or similar applications involving temporal data.
