The given context does not provide any direct information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only provides details about various deep learning architectures such as ResNet-101, Wide-ResNet-101, InceptionV3, and MnasNet-A1, along with their respective parameters, model speeds, top-k accuracies, macro precision, and macro recall. Therefore, it is not possible to determine from the given context where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is located.
