Based on the given context, it appears that the deployed deep learning model is a classification model (ResNet152, He et al. (2015)). This model is stored in the form of a binary pickle file after being trained using the STARdbi\_train function. However, there isn't explicit information about the specific process used to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed step-by-step process based solely on the available context.
