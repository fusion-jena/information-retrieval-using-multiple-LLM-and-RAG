The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is stratified cross-validation. This method involves splitting the input dataset into two disjoint subsets, namely the training and the testing sets. The training set is utilized to learn the model, while the test set is employed to evaluate its performance. However, this approach might lead to biased results due to specific characteristics of the chosen partitioning. To mitigate this issue, stratified cross-validation is applied, which ensures that each subset maintains the original class distribution.

In this case, the dataset is imbalanced, with one class (Cymodocea) accounting for 75% of the data. As a consequence, accuracy may not be a reliable metric since it only considers the proportion of correct predictions out of the total number of samples. Instead, precision, recall, and F-measure are adopted to assess the model performance more accurately. These metrics focus on correctly identifying both positive and negative classes, providing a better understanding of the model's ability to handle imbalanced datasets.

To summarize, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is stratified cross-validation, along with employing precision, recall, and F-measure as performance metrics instead of accuracy.
