The text does not provide explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that Sharma et al. (2017) utilized crowd-sourcing, involving non-expert users for obtaining manual annotations. This suggests that they may have employed some form of image labeling or annotation technique, such as bounding boxes or semantic segmentation, but the exact method is not specified. Additionally, Xu et al. (2021) developed a Convolutional Neural Network-based segmentation model, which implies that they likely used pixel-level annotations like instance segmentation or semantic segmentation for training their model.
