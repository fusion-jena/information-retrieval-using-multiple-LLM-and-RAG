The purpose of the machine learning (ML) model discussed in the provided context is for classification. Specifically, it is used to classify Vegetation Types (VTs), which are not explicitly defined but seem to refer to different types of land cover or vegetation found within a specific area. The ML model uses an implementation of the XGBoostClassifier, which is a decision-tree-based ensemble Machine Learning algorithm designed for supervised learning tasks such as regression and classification problems. In this case, the model is being used for multi-class classification to distinguish between various VTs based on input features derived from Earth Observation (EO) datasets, including seasonal vegetation indices, backscatter composites, elevation, and slope. The goal of using this ML model is to create a comprehensive and accurate map of VTs across a specified region, taking advantage of the large amount of available EO data and leveraging advanced computational techniques to extract meaningful information from it.
