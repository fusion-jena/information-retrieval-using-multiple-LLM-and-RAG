The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information given, we can infer that the data used in this case might be DNA sequences or phylogenetic trees. This is because the text discusses concepts such as 'taxon', 'query sequence', 'tree-based distance', and 'dynamic programming to find the placement'. These are all terms commonly associated with bioinformatics and computational biology, particularly in the field of phylogenetics. Therefore, while it's not explicitly stated, it's likely that the data format used here is related to genomic or genetic data rather than common multimedia formats like images, audio, video, or CSV files.
