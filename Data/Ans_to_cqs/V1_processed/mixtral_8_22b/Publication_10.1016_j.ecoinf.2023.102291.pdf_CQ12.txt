The study uses a customized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a pre-trained ResNet152V2 architecture for sound classification tasks. The customized CNN consists of three convolutional layers with 32 filters each, a kernel size of 4x4, and ReLU activation functions. Each convolutional layer is followed by a dropout layer with a rate of 0.4 and a max pooling layer with a kernel size of 4x4. After these layers, there is a fully connected layer with 64 ReLU units, another dropout layer with a rate of 0.4, and a softmax function. The number of units in the softmax function depends on the number of species being classified. The models were trained for 50 epochs using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 and a batch size.
