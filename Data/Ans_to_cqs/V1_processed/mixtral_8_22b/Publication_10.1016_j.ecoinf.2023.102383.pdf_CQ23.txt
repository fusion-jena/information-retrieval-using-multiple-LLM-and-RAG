The authors do not explicitly mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using diverse datasets or employing techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting. However, they discuss the use of Feature Pyramid Networks (FPNs), which help improve the performance of the model across various scales and sizes of objects. By combining feature maps from different layers of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), FPNs allow the model to capture both high-level semantically rich features and low-level detailed features. This approach enables the model to better handle objects of varying sizes and shapes, thus potentially improving its ability to generalize to new data. Additionally, the authors compare several architectures with different numbers of CNN layers, including FRC\_ResNet18FPN, FRC\_ResNet34FPN, and FRC\_ResNet152FPN, suggesting that they may have explored various configurations to find the most suitable one for their task. Nevertheless, without explicit statements regarding the use of diverse datasets or validation methods, it is unclear whether these aspects were considered when developing the deep learning model.
