The given context does not provide information about specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it discusses the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in various applications, including speech recognition, image recognition, and natural language processing. It also mentions the need for large amounts of data and computational resources for proper training of ANNs. Additionally, the text describes model performance assessment techniques, such as analyzing key metrics like the coefficient of determination (R2), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). Unfortunately, there is no mention of any specific data annotation techniques used in this study.
