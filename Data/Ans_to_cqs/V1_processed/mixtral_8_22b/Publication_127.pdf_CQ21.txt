After the model training process, there are several postprocessing steps that can be taken to evaluate and improve the performance of the deep neural networks (DNNs). Some of these steps include creating saliency maps, calculating metrics, and generating confusion matrices.

Saliency maps help visualize which parts of the input data were most important for the model's decision-making process. This can provide insights into how the model interprets the data and whether it focuses on relevant features. In the given context, saliency maps could be used to understand which areas of the images contributed most to the animal detection task.

Calculating various evaluation metrics is another crucial step in assessing the performance of the DNNs. These metrics may include classification accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). For instance, Table 2 in the provided context presents the Top-1 accuracy percentages for different architectures on Task I: detecting images containing animals.

Lastly, generating confusion matrices allows researchers to identify patterns of misclassification made by the models. A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the predicted and actual classes, providing valuable information about false positives and negatives. As mentioned in the context, the best model's confusion matrix was presented in SI Appendix, Fig. S10.

In summary, some essential postprocessing steps after model training involve creating saliency maps, calculating evaluation metrics, and generating confusion matrices. These techniques aid in understanding the model's behavior, evaluating its performance, and identifying potential improvements.
