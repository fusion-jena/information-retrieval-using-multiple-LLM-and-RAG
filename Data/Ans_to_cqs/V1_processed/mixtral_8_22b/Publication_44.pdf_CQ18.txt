The text does not explicitly state the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it can be inferred that the authors monitored the model performance by tracking the validation loss during training. The best performing model based on the validation loss was then saved and used for further testing. This suggests that the authors employed a form of early stopping or checkpointing strategy to prevent overfitting and select the optimal model for evaluation.
