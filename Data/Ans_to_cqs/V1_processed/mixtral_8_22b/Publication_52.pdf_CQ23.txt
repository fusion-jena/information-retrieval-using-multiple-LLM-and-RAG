The article does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it mentions that Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs), which are part of the deep learning methodology employed in this study, have the potential to generalize performance based solely on their training data set. This implies that the authors may have relied on the inherent properties of ELMs to achieve good generalization. Additionally, the paper introduces a new Deep Learning algorithm called Regularized Autoencoder Learning (MIGRATE\_ELM) and proposes a novel approach named 'Geo Location Country Based Service'. These innovations could potentially contribute to improving the model's generalizability, although the exact mechanisms or techniques used to validate and enhance the model's performance are not explicitly discussed in the given context.
