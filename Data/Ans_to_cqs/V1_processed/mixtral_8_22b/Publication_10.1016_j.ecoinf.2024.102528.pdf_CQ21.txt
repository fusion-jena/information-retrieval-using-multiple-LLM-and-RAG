After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be taken to evaluate and interpret the results. These may include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, and creating confusion matrices. However, based on the given context, it appears that the focus is primarily on using the trained model (BirdNET-Analyzer) for identifying bird species rather than discussing postprocessing steps related to model evaluation or interpretation.

That being said, some postprocessing steps mentioned in the context involve processing the output of the BirdNET-Analyzer. After dividing the audio recordings into 3-second segments, the analyzer identifies the top three species with the highest confidence scores. To filter out potentially erroneous predictions, threshold values of 0.35, 0.25, and 0.15 were applied for the first, second, and third species, respectively. Additionally, species-specific thresholds were also considered. Following these steps, the number of vocalizations for each species was then summed.

While not explicitly stated as postprocessing steps, evaluations of the BirdNET-Analyzer's performance were conducted before and after validation. Before validation, the analyzer achieved an average recall of 29.7% ± 3.9 SE and an average precision of 80.9% ± 3.8 SE when tested on a dataset containing 4600 vocalizations from 23 species. Despite having relatively low recall rates, the high precision indicated reliable species detection for further analysis. A fixed confidence threshold of 0.35 was used for all species during this preliminary analysis.
