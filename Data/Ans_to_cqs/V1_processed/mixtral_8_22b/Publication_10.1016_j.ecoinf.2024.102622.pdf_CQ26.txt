To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes or labels in both sets. This ensures that the model learns from a representative sample of each class, reducing potential biases towards any particular class.

Oversampling is a technique where samples from the minority class are duplicated to balance the dataset. This helps prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class due to its higher representation in the dataset. However, it may lead to overfitting if not handled carefully.

Undersampling, on the other hand, involves removing samples from the majority class to achieve a balanced dataset. While this reduces the risk of overfitting, it also discards potentially useful information.

Diverse data collection aims to gather a wide variety of examples representing all possible scenarios within the problem domain. This includes collecting data from various sources, under different conditions, and with varying levels of complexity. By doing so, the model becomes more robust and less likely to exhibit biases towards specific types of input.

In summary, addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline requires careful consideration of how the dataset is split, whether to use oversampling or undersampling, and ensuring diversity in data collection. Each technique has its advantages and disadvantages, making it essential to choose the most appropriate one depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the task at hand.
