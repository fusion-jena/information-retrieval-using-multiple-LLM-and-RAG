After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the project or study. Some common postprocessing steps include:

1. Model evaluation metrics: Calculating various performance metrics such as F1 score, overall accuracy, Kappa coefficient, etc., to evaluate the model's performance. In this case, the table shows the error matrix for the ensemble CNN, which includes the predicted vs reference classes, user's accuracy (UA), producer's accuracy (PA), and overall accuracy.

2. Confusion matrix: A confusion matrix is often created to visualize the performance of the classification algorithm. It provides insights into the types of errors made by the classifier. In this case, Table 2 presents the confusion matrix for the ensemble CNN.

3. Saliency maps: Saliency maps can be generated to highlight important regions within images that contribute significantly to the final prediction. This helps in understanding how the model makes its decisions. However, there is no mention of saliency maps in the given context.

4. Cross-validation: To ensure robustness and generalizability of the models, techniques like k-fold cross-validation can be employed during the training phase. Here, it was mentioned that a random search was conducted to find an optimal parameter set using three-fold cross-validation for the random forest model.

5. Hyperparameter tuning: Grid search or randomized search methods can be applied to fine-tune hyperparameters and improve the model's performance further. In this case, a grid search was utilized to refine the parameter ranges for the random forest model.
