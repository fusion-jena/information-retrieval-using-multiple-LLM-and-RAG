The information regarding the availability of the deep learning pipeline's data repository is not explicitly stated in the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide specific details about where the data repository is located, such as whether it is available on platforms like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. It would be best to refer to the original research paper or contact the authors for accurate information.
