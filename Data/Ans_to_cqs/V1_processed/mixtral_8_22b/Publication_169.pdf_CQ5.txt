The paper does not explicitly mention the use of standard datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it mentions using a dataset containing images of 100 different plant species leaves. This dataset was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and was used for training and validating the proposed deep learning model. To address the issue of limited dataset size and prevent overfitting, data augmentation techniques were employed to increase the amount of available training data.

I do not know what datasets were used in the deep learning pipeline.
