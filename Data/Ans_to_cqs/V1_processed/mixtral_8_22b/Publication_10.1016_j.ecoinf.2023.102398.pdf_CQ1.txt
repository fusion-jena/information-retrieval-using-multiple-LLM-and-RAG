Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the size of the dataset used for custom training is sufficiently large, implying that some form of data collection was performed. Additionally, the table shows that the model was tested using four different datasets, but it doesn't specify where or how these datasets were collected. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the methods used for collecting raw data in this particular case.
