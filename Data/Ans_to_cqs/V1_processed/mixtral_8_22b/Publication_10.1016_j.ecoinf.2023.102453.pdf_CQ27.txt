To deploy the trained deep learning model, the first step involves converting the model into the TensorFlow Lite format. This conversion is necessary because it allows the model to be compatible with edge devices like the Raspberry Pi (RPi). However, this conversion might lead to a reduction in the model's size and potentially its accuracy. Once the model is converted, it can be utilized on an edge device for classifying new, previously unseen images. Additionally, there is an optional step where the TensorFlow or TensorFlow Lite model can be further optimized based on the specific requirements of the application and the capabilities of the edge device. This optimization can focus on either reducing the size of the model or improving its latency. Furthermore, edge devices such as the RPi can also be employed to execute Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, such as Grad-CAM, to generate visualizations via heatmaps.
