While the given context does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model, some general preprocessing steps commonly applied in deep learning models include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization involves rescaling the pixel values of the input images so they fall within a certain range, typically between 0 and 1. Scaling refers to adjusting the dimensions of the input images to fit the requirements of the deep learning model. Cleaning may involve removing noise or irrelevant elements from the input images. However, without explicit details about the preprocessing steps taken in this particular case, we cannot provide a definitive answer.
