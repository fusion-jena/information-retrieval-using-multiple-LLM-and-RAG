Unfortunately, there isn't enough context provided to determine what specific process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, common steps involved in deploying a trained deep learning model include model serialization, platform selection, and integration into existing systems or applications. Model serialization involves saving the trained model parameters and architecture so they can be loaded later without retraining. Platform selection refers to choosing where to host the deployed model, such as on cloud servers or edge devices. Integration into existing systems may involve creating APIs or other interfaces to allow communication between the deployed model and other software components.
