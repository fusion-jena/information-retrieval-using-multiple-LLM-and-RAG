Unfortunately, none of the provided sources explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in their respective deep learning pipelines. However, it can be inferred from the context that some form of image labeling or pixel-level annotations was likely employed due to the nature of the tasks being performed, such as semantic segmentation, object detection, and land cover classification. These tasks often require detailed annotations like bounding boxes, polygons, or pixel-wise labels to train deep learning models effectively. For example, the paper by Liu et al. focuses on semantic segmentation for high-resolution aerial imagery, which typically involves pixel-level annotations. Similarly, the work by Lees et al. discusses a machine learning pipeline to predict vegetation health, suggesting that some form of image labeling might have been utilized to identify healthy and unhealthy vegetation areas. Nevertheless, without explicit information about the data annotation techniques used in these studies, one cannot provide a definitive answer.
