To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed. One common approach is to use a fixed random seed value throughout the entire process. This ensures that any random operations performed during training will produce consistent results each time the code is run. Another strategy is to perform multiple runs with different random seeds and then average the results. This helps reduce the impact of individual runs being influenced by specific random initializations. Additionally, techniques such as dropout regularization and batch normalization can help improve the generalizability of the model by introducing controlled noise into the training process. Finally, it is important to carefully evaluate the performance of the model on validation and test datasets to ensure that it is not overfitting to the training data due to random initialization effects.
