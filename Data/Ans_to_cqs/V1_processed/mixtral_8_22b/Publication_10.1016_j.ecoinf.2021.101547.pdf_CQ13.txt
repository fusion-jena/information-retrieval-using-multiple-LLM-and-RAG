Based on the given context, the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are not explicitly mentioned. However, the text does mention that there are numerous and highly technical basic training options, some of which are listed in Table 1. Unfortunately, without access to this table, I cannot provide the exact hyperparameters used in the model.

Typical hyperparameters used in deep learning models include learning rate, optimizer, batch size, number of epochs, and others. The learning rate determines how much the weights in the neural network should be adjusted during training. Commonly used optimizers include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad. Batch size refers to the number of samples processed before the model is updated, and the number of epochs specifies the number of times the algorithm will work through the entire dataset.

In the given context, it is stated that the mini-batch size is adjustable depending on the dataset, but typically in increments such as 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc. It is also mentioned that the mini-batch size is ultimately limited by the amount of memory available to the GPU. Additionally, the concept of 'epoch' is explained as a full cycle through the entire set of training images, where the number of iterations per epoch is equal to the total number of training images divided by the mini-batch size.

Without further information, I am unable to provide the exact values of the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
