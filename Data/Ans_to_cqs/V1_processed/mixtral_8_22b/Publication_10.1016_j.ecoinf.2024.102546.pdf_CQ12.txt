The papers mentioned do not provide explicit information about the specific type of deep learning model used in their pipelines. However, some clues can be found in certain papers. For instance, Beck et al. (2021) mention using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for computer vision tasks in agriculture. Similarly, Rahman et al. (2022) discuss using deep neural networks for weed detection, which could imply the use of CNNs or other types of deep learning models suitable for image processing tasks. Nevertheless, it should be noted that these are only assumptions based on the given context, and the exact type of deep learning model used in each paper cannot be definitively determined without further information.
