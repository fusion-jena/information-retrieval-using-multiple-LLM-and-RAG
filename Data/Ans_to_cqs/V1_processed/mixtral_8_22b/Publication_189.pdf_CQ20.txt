According to the given information, the deep learning model was trained using a machine equipped with one GPU. It appears that the specific type or model of the GPU is not mentioned. However, it can be inferred that the model utilized GPU acceleration due to its compatibility with TensorFlow version 1.14.0, which supports GPU computing. Additionally, the mention of 'batch size for mrcnn training is taken as a product of GPU and Images per GPU' further confirms the usage of GPU resources for training the model. Therefore, based on the available context, we can conclude that the deep learning model was trained using GPU resources.
