Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available in the provided context to determine which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. The text discusses the development and application of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for predicting the distribution of Rhododendron arboreum in the Himalayas, but does not mention any details about the deployment environment or platform. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the use of platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform.
