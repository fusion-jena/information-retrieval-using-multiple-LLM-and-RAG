Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the optimizer. However, it mentions that search algorithms like the genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are often used to solve model parameter problems, including the number of neurons in neural networks and the error penalty factor in SVM. It also states that PSO is frequently used in DO modeling in conjunction with various algorithms like BPNN, GRU, LSTM, SVR, and others, demonstrating high efficiency and good robustness with minimal computation. Additionally, other optimization algorithms, such as the multi-verse optimizer, have been employed for parameter optimization.
