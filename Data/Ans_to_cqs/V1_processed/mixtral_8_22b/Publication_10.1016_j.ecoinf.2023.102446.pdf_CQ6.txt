The text does not provide specific details about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, common preprocessing steps include data cleaning, which involves handling missing values, outliers, and errors in the dataset. Normalization and scaling are also important preprocessing techniques used to standardize the range of independent variables or features of data. In addition, feature selection can be performed to identify relevant features that contribute significantly to the output variable. It is crucial to note that the choice of preprocessing steps depends on the nature of the problem and the type of data being analyzed.

Based on the given context, we cannot determine the exact preprocessing steps taken before training a deep learning model. Therefore, it is recommended to refer to additional resources or consult domain experts for more accurate information.
