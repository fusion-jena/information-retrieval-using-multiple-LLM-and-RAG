The purpose of the deep learning model described in this context is not explicitly stated. However, based on its design and components, it appears to be a regression model aimed at predicting or estimating the Manganese (Mn) content in soil samples. This can be inferred from the fact that the model has an input layer with 4200 dimensions of spectral reflectance data, multiple hidden layers with Rectified Linear Unit (ReLu) activation functions, batch normalization layers, dropout layers, and a single dimensional output layer representing the Mn content. Additionally, the use of the correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), coefficient of determination (R^2), and mean relative error (MAE) as performance metrics further suggests that the model is designed for regression tasks rather than classification, segmentation, or object detection.
