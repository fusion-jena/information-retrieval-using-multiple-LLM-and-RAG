The paper does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some common strategies used in deep learning pipelines include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using techniques like k-fold cross-validation to reduce variance due to random sampling, and employing ensemble methods to average out the effects of random initialization. These strategies help mitigate the impact of randomness on model performance and improve the reliability of results.
