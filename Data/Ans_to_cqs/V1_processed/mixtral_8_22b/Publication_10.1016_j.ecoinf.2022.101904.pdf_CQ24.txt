Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, specifically regarding random seed values. However, some common strategies used in deep learning pipelines to manage randomness include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using deterministic algorithms where possible, and employing techniques like ensemble methods or cross-validation to reduce variance caused by randomness. It should be noted that these strategies may not directly apply to the specific 3DUNetGSFormer architecture mentioned in the context without further details.
