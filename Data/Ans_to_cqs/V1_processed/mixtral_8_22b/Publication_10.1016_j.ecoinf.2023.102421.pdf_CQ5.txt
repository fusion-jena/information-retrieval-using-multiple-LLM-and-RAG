The datasets used in this deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned as being well-known datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the datasets used are described as consisting of 268 sample plots with 39 features in a tabulated format. These features include bands from both Landsat 8 and Sentinel-1A satellite imagery, as well as various vegetation indices calculated from those bands. The goal of the deep learning pipeline is to use these datasets to train and validate models for estimating aboveground biomass (AGB) in a forested region.
