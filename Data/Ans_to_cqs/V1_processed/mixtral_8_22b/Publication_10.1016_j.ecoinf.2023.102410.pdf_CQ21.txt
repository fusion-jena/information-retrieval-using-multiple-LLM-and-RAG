The given context does not provide information on the specific post-processing steps involved after model training for this particular study. However, some common post-processing steps include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics such as accuracy and precision, creating confusion matrices, and performing cross-validation or bootstrapping techniques to evaluate the robustness of the results. These methods help researchers understand how well their models perform and identify areas where they can improve their algorithms. In this case, it is unclear which, if any, of these methods were used by the authors.

Based on the table provided, we can see that the most frequently detected patterns were P3 and P2, with over 90% of detections combined. The least frequent pattern was Alternating P3A to P3, which had no detections recorded. It appears that the authors may have used some form of detection algorithm to analyze the vocalizations and classify them into different categories based on their structure. However, without further information about the methodology used in this study, it is difficult to determine exactly what post-processing steps were taken after model training.
