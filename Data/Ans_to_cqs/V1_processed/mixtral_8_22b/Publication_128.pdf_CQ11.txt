The paper does not provide any specific links to a data repository containing the deep learning pipelines mentioned in the text. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. However, the authors mention testing six deep learning methods in four public plant image datasets. It would be best to refer to the original research papers or contact the authors directly for access to their code and datasets.
