The context does not provide explicit information on the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into sets such as train, test, and validation. However, common practices in machine learning involve splitting the dataset into these subsets using random sampling or stratified sampling techniques. Typically, the dataset is divided into three parts: training set, validation set, and testing set. The training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set helps tune the model's hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Lastly, the testing set evaluates the final model's performance. Common ratios for splitting datasets are 70/15/15 or 80/10/10 for training, validation, and testing respectively.
