Based on the given context, there isn't any direct information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, we can infer some general strategies based on common practices in machine learning and deep learning fields.

One strategy to manage randomness is setting a fixed seed value before training the model. This ensures reproducibility of results since the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers will be generated each time the code is executed. Different libraries like NumPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc., have their own functions to set seed values.

Another approach is employing cross-validation techniques, which involve splitting the dataset into several subsets and then training and testing the model multiple times, each time with different subsets. This helps in reducing the impact of random initialization of weights and biases in the model.

Ensemble methods, like Random Forests mentioned in the context, also deal with randomness inherently. These methods combine multiple base learners (decision trees in case of Random Forest), where each learner is trained on a randomly selected subset of features and samples. By aggregating the outputs of these diverse learners, ensemble methods reduce variance and improve overall model performance.

Lastly, hyperparameter optimization techniques, such as grid search or randomized search, can also indirectly address randomness. These methods systematically explore various combinations of hyperparameters and select the best performing ones. By trying out different configurations, they mitigate the effect of random initializations and contribute towards building more robust models.
