After a machine learning model has been trained, there are several post-processing steps that can be taken to evaluate and improve its performance. Here are some common ones:

1. **Model Evaluation**: This involves using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves, etc., to assess how well the model is performing. These metrics help us understand the strengths and weaknesses of our model.

2. **Confusion Matrix**: A confusion matrix is a table layout that allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm. Each row of the matrix represents the instances in an actual class while each column represents the instances in a predicted class. It gives us insight not only into the errors made by the classifier but more importantly the types of errors that are being made.

3. **Cross Validation**: Cross validation is a technique for assessing how the results of a statistical analysis will generalize to an independent data set. It is mainly used in settings where the goal is prediction, and one wants to estimate how accurately a predictive model will perform in practice.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Hyperparameters are parameters whose values are set before the learning process begins. They determine the structure of the model or how the model is trained. Examples include learning rate, number of layers in a neural network, etc. Hyperparameter tuning involves selecting a set of optimal hyperparameters to improve the model’s performance.

5. **Feature Importance**: Feature importance refers to techniques that assign a score to input features based on their contribution towards improving the model’s predictions. Techniques like permutation feature importance, SHAP values, etc., can be used here.

6. **Saliency Maps**: In the context of deep learning models, saliency maps are used to highlight which parts of the input were relevant for making a particular decision. They provide insights into what the model is focusing on when it makes decisions.
