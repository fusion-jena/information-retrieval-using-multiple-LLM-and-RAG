The text does not provide explicit information about the use of deep learning models or their evaluation metrics. However, it mentions that the study reports standard accuracies and kappa values to enable comparison with other studies. These metrics are commonly used to evaluate the performance of classification tasks, including those performed by deep learning models. Accuracy measures the percentage of correct predictions out of all predictions made, while Kappa statistic is a measure of agreement between two raters who each classify items into mutually exclusive categories. It takes into account the possibility of the agreement occurring by chance. Therefore, based on the given context, it can be inferred that the authors may have used accuracy and Kappa statistics to evaluate the performance of their classification method, although they do not explicitly mention using deep learning models.
