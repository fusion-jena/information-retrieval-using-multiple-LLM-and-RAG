To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes within both sets. This technique ensures that the classifier does not become biased towards any specific class due to imbalanced data.

Oversampling is another method used to handle data imbalance. In this approach, synthetic samples are generated from the minority class to balance the dataset. Techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) can be applied to create new instances based on existing ones.

Undersampling, on the other hand, focuses on reducing the number of majority class examples to match the count of minority class instances. Random under-sampling or informed under-sampling methods can be utilized depending upon the nature of the problem.

Lastly, collecting diverse data is crucial to ensure that the trained model performs well across various scenarios. A diversely collected dataset should contain examples representing different age groups, genders, ethnicities, etc., ensuring fairness and unbiased performance.

These techniques help mitigate data bias during preprocessing and contribute significantly to building robust and reliable deep learning pipelines.
