In this study, the collected data was divided into three parts for the purpose of training, validating, and testing the deep learning models. The division of data was based on temporal criteria. Data from 2003 to 2020 was used for training the models. The data from 2021 was utilized for validation purposes, which involved assessing the effectiveness of the models' predictions using data from points A, B, and C. Lastly, the data from 2022 was reserved for testing the final performance of the trained models.
