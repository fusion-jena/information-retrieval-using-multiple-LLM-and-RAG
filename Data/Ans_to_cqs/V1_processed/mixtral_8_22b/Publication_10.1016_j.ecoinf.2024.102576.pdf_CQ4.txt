The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that data augmentation is employed along with Pheno-Convolved Features (PCF) to improve the performance and accuracy of the deep learning model. Data augmentation techniques generally include methods such as flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, and shifting images. These techniques help increase the amount of training data available, reduce overfitting, and improve the generalization capabilities of the model. It is likely that similar techniques were used in this study, but without further details, it cannot be confirmed.
