To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques have been employed by researchers. In this particular case, the authors utilized three main approaches to handle the imbalanced nature of their training data due to varying areas of each forest type classification. These methods include:

1. Inputting the original data: Here, the authors did not alter the number of samples for each forest type, allowing them to vary based on the area of each forest type. This approach maintains the natural distribution of the data but may lead to biased results if certain classes dominate the dataset.

2. Data reduction: To mitigate the effects of uneven sample sizes, the authors implemented a sampling method to limit the number of samples for all forest types to the same value. However, this technique introduced another challenge â€“ differing sampling ratios among classes. Despite this limitation, data reduction helps balance the dataset and prevent any single class from dominating the learning process.

3. Data augmentation: By employing image rotation or overlapping plots, the authors standardized the number of samples for each forest type. This technique effectively increases the representation of underrepresented classes without creating artificial instances, thus reducing potential overfitting issues.

These strategies aim to minimize the impact of data bias during preprocessing and improve the overall performance of the deep learning models. It should be noted that these techniques do not guarantee perfect balance or eliminate bias entirely; rather, they serve as practical solutions to manage inherent challenges associated with real-world datasets.
