The study implemented a strategy to monitor the model performance during training by including pure training areas. These well-identified areas contained at least 50 pixels in total and prominently represented the class of interest. The distribution of these areas was carried out through simplified random sampling. This approach aimed to effectively capture variability within each class and improve the overall classification accuracy.
