Based on the given context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized using techniques like grid search or random search. However, we can infer that some form of optimization might have been performed based on the statement "The chosen parameterization appeared the most appropriate by achieving a good compromise." This suggests that different parameterizations were tried out before selecting the final one. Additionally, the use of expert knowledge and literature review indicates that informed decisions were made during the parameterization process. Nevertheless, without specific details regarding the optimization technique employed, it cannot be definitively stated whether grid search, random search, or another method was utilized.
