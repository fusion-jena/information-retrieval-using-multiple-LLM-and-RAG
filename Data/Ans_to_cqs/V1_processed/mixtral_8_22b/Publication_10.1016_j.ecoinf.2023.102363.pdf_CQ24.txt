The text provides information about fine-tuning a base model with Gulf of Mexico data, employing several techniques to enhance its performance. However, it doesn't explicitly mention any strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing the random seed value. Nevertheless, some general approaches can be suggested based on common practices in deep learning:

1. Fixing the Random Seed Value: One way to manage randomness is to fix the random seed value before running experiments. By setting a fixed seed, one ensures that the results obtained from different runs will be consistent and reproducible.

2. Using Ensemble Methods: Another strategy to mitigate the effects of randomness is to use ensemble methods. These involve combining multiple models, often trained with different initializations or subsets of data, to produce more stable and accurate predictions.

3. Employing Regularization Techniques: Regularization techniques like Dropout and DropConnect help prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize. They introduce randomness into the network by dropping connections or neurons during training, which can also help reduce sensitivity to initialization values.

While these strategies may not directly address the issue of handling randomness due to the random seed value, they contribute to building more robust and reliable deep learning pipelines.
