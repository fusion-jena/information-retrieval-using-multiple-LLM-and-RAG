According to the given context, the metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model is accuracy. Specifically, the dataset is divided into training and testing sets with a ratio of 8:2, resulting in 3094 test samples and 12,340 training samples. The classification models are then built using the training set, and their performance is evaluated based on the accuracy achieved on the test set. This evaluation approach is consistent across all presented results, including those obtained using the classic CNN model and other proposed models. However, it should be noted that while accuracy is a commonly used metric for evaluating the performance of deep learning models, other metrics such as precision, recall, or F1 score could also have been considered depending on the specific requirements and goals of the study.
