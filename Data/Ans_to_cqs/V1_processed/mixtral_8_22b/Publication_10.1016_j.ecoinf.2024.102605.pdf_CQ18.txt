The information provided does not contain specific details about strategies used to monitor model performance during training. However, common methods include tracking metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves, etc., depending on the type of problem being solved. Additionally, visualizing loss functions can help understand how well the model is learning. Cross-validation and regularization techniques are also often employed to prevent overfitting and improve generalizability.
