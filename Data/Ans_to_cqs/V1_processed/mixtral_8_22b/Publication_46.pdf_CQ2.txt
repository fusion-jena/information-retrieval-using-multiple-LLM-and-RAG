The paper does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in their deep learning pipeline. However, since they use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for processing multidimensional data that follows a grid pattern, it can be inferred that the input data could be images or any other form of gridded data. CNNs are commonly used for image classification tasks due to their ability to automatically extract relevant features from the input data. Therefore, it is likely that the authors used image data as part of their deep learning pipeline.
