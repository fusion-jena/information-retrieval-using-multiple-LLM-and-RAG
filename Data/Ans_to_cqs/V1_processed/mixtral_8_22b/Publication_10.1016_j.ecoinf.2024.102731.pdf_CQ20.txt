The given context does not provide information on the specific hardware resources used for training a deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. The context primarily focuses on land cover types, urban areas, vegetation coverage, and other related topics. Therefore, I cannot determine which hardware resources were utilized for training the deep learning model based solely on this context.
