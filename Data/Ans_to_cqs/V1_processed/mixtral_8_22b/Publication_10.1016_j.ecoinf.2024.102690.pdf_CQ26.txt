Based on the given context, there isn't any direct mention of specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, some relevant information about the methodology used in the study can be extracted from the text.

In this study, the Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM) is employed as an unsupervised learning neural network approach. It combines dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis to allocate research units into different ecosystem service (ES) bundles based on spatial similarities. The ES bundles are divided using SOFM, and the ideal number of bundles is determined by calculating the Davis-Boldin Index (DBI). Hotspot analysis (Getis-Ord Gi*) is then applied to examine the spatial clustering of ESV and consider hotspot areas with a significance level of 90% or higher as potential ecological sources.

While these methods do not directly relate to addressing data bias in the preprocessing stage of a deep learning pipeline, they demonstrate how the researchers approached their task of identifying ecological sources. In general, when dealing with data bias in machine learning models, various strategies like stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and collecting diverse datasets can help mitigate biases and improve model performance. These techniques aim to balance classes, reduce imbalances, and ensure fair representation across all groups within the dataset.
