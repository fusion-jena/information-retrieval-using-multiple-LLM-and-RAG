The given context does not provide information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the paper. However, generally speaking, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and landmark annotation. These techniques help label the input data, which is then fed into the deep learning models for training purposes.

Based on the context, it appears that the authors have employed a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM) to develop a hybrid model for capturing the intricate process of drought propagation. While this information suggests that some form of image or spatial data was likely used, there is no explicit mention of the type of data annotation technique utilized in the study. Therefore, without further details, it is difficult to determine the exact data annotation techniques used in this particular deep learning pipeline.
