The performance of the deep learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is evaluated using several metrics such as error rate, training loss, validation loss, and accuracy. Initially, the model achieved an error rate of 11.95%, with a training loss of 0.3462 and a validation loss of 0.2847. After fine-tuning the model with a 10-fold lower learning rate, it achieved an improved accuracy of 94.8% (corresponding to an error rate of 5.2%) with a training loss of 0.1397 and a validation loss of 0.1446 after ten epochs. These results indicate that the model has been successfully optimized to achieve better performance. However, other common evaluation metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score have not been explicitly mentioned in the given context.
