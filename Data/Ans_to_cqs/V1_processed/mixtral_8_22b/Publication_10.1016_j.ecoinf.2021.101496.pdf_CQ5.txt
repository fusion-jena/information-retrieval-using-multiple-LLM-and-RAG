The given context does not provide information about specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it mentions that the Rasp2SPAD system was evaluated using winter rapeseed images and extracted various color indices from them. It also calculated 19 different indices related to the SPAD value obtained from the SPAD-502Plus handheld sensor. Therefore, we can infer that the dataset used in this case is based on winter rapeseed images and their corresponding color indices.

Based on the keywords mentioned in the abstract, it appears that the study involves image analysis using Python programming language and possibly Raspberry Pi hardware with Pi Camera. Additionally, the article references suggest that the research may involve plant physiology, fog computing, and smartphone-based optical assays in the food safety field. However, without further context, it is difficult to determine if these technologies were directly involved in the deep learning pipeline or if they were simply relevant to the overall topic of the study.
