The text does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. Typically, this process involves randomly splitting the dataset into three subsets: training, testing, and validation. The training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Finally, the test set is used to evaluate the final performance of the model. However, since the specific criteria used for splitting the data in this case are not mentioned, it cannot be determined with certainty how the data was divided for training, testing, and validation purposes.
