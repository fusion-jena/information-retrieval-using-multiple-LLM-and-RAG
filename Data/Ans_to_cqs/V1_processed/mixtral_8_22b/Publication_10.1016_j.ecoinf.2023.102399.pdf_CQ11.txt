Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to provide the exact data repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. However, considering the authors are affiliated with reputable institutions such as China Agricultural University and their work was published in Ecological Informatics, it would be reasonable to assume that they followed proper scientific protocols and made their dataset publicly accessible through a reliable data repository like Zenodo, Figshare, or Dryad. To find the specific link, one could search these repositories using keywords from the paper title, author names, or other relevant details. Alternatively, contacting the corresponding author directly might also yield the desired information.
