The context does not provide explicit information about the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, considering the topic discussed in the context, we can infer that the data format used is likely related to hyperspectral images (HSIs). Hyperspectral imagery is a type of remote sensing data that captures detailed spectral information across numerous narrow bands throughout the electromagnetic spectrum. This rich spectral information allows for accurate identification and characterization of materials within the scene. Therefore, it can be concluded that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context is most likely hyperspectral images.
