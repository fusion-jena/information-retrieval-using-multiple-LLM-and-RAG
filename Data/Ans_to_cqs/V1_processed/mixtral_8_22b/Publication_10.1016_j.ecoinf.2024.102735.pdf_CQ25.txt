Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about the specific purpose or type of the deep learning model being discussed. However, we can infer from the context that the deep learning model is likely being used for regression tasks, specifically for predicting different algal-related parameters such as chlorophyll-a, phycocyanin, algal cells, and toxins. The context mentions machine learning models like Random Forest (RF), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Support Vector Regression (SVR) being used for these predictions. Additionally, the context discusses hyperparameters tuning for improving model performance, including the kernel function, epsilon, regularization parameter (C), and degree, which are relevant to regression tasks. Therefore, while not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is being used for regression purposes within this context.
