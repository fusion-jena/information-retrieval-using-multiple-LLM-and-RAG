The text does not provide explicit details about the evaluation metrics used specifically for deep learning models. However, it mentions several performance metrics used to assess various machine learning models, including linear and ensemble methods like Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Light Gradient Boosting Machine. These metrics include R^2 (coefficient of determination), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Relative Root Mean Square Error (rRMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

In summary, based on the given context, the performance metrics used to evaluate the machine learning models are R^2, RMSE, rRMSE, and MAE. It should be noted that these metrics might also apply to deep learning models, but the text does not explicitly confirm this.
