The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics such as UIQM, UCIQE, and NIQE. UIQM stands for Underwater Image Quality Measure, which assesses the underwater image quality based on colorfulness, sharpness, and contrast. UCIQE represents Underwater Color Image Quality Evaluation, focusing on color features like chromatic moments and saturation. Lastly, NIQE refers to Natural Image Quality Evaluation, which uses statistical features to measure perceptual quality.

The tables presented showcase the quantitative comparisons of different methods using these metrics. For instance, in Table 2, the proposed method achieves the highest UIQM score of 3.12 and the highest UCIQE score of 0.591 when compared to other techniques. Similarly, in Table 3, the suggested approach obtains the best UIQM score of 3.23 and the top UCIQE score of 0.612 among its competitors.

These metrics allow for an objective assessment of the model's performance. Higher values in UIQM and UCIQE suggest improved visual perception in the outcomes, while a lower NIQE score implies superior perceptual quality.
