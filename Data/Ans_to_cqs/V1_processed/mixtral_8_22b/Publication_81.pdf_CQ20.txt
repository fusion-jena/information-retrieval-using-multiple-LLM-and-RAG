The given context does not provide any specific details about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It only mentions that the model uses Elastic Net-Stacked Autoencoder (EN-SAE) and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). However, typically, deep learning models require significant computational power and memory, making GPU or TPU usage common for such tasks. Without further information, it cannot be determined exactly what hardware was used for training the model.
