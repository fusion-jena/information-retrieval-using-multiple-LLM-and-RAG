Based on the given context, it does not explicitly state the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, we can infer that the PLUS model utilizes certain evaluation metrics such as the Pearson correlation coefficient (R), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) to assess the performance of its predictions. These metrics could potentially serve as indicators for determining when training is complete or satisfactory. For instance, if the Pearson correlation coefficient approaches 1, indicating a strong correlation between predicted and actual values, or if the RMSE falls within the range of high accuracy (<0.1), these could suggest that the model has been adequately trained. Similarly, if the MAPE values fall below 0.1, indicating excellent prediction accuracy, this could also signify that the training phase is complete. However, without explicit information about the stopping criteria, these are merely speculations based on common practices in machine learning model training.
