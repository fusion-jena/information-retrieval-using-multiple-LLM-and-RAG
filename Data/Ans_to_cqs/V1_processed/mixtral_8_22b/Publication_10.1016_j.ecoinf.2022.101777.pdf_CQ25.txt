The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is not explicitly stated as being a 'deep learning' model, but rather a 'Random Forest' (RF) model, which is a type of machine learning algorithm. However, considering the overall context, the primary goal of this model appears to be image classification. More specifically, the RF model is employed to classify pixels within images into various categories or classes. This process involves creating multiple decision trees randomly using the Gini coefficient to split them, resulting in a model capable of classifying each pixel based on majority voting among the decision trees. In this case, the model aims to distinguish between different land cover types, including new vineyards, whose spectral signatures change significantly over time due to growth. Therefore, the main objective of this model is to accurately classify and identify specific land cover types within the study area.
