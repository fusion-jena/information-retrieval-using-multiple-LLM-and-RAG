The context does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into sets such as train, test, and validation. However, it mentions that Random Forests (RF), one of the machine learning techniques discussed, trains each tree on a random subset of the data. This implies that some form of splitting or partitioning of the dataset occurs during the training process. Typically, datasets are divided into training, testing, and sometimes validation subsets to evaluate the performance of the model and prevent overfitting. Common criteria for this division include using a fixed percentage of the total data (e.g., 70% for training, 30% for testing) or employing cross-validation techniques like k-fold cross-validation. Without more specific details from the given context, these general practices can be assumed to apply.
