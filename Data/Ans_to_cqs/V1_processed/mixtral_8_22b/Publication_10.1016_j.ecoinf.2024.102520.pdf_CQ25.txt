Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of a deep learning model or its specific purpose. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact purpose of any potential deep learning models used in this study. However, considering the nature of the research, which involves analyzing satellite imagery and geospatial data, one can infer that such models could be employed for tasks like image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, or change detection. These applications would help identify patterns, classify land cover types, detect objects of interest, or monitor changes over time within the study area. Nevertheless, without further details regarding the use of deep learning techniques, we cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.
