The text does not provide explicit details about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that fieldwork expeditions were conducted during 2021 (June, August, and October) to gather images and validate orthomosaic annotations. These expeditions likely involved capturing images of sub-alpine shrub species using cameras or other imaging devices. Additionally, the text refers to the importance of having a large and accurate dataset with images and their corresponding labels, which suggests that both visual data (images) and label data (species identifications) were collected during these fieldwork missions. It also emphasizes the need for high-quality annotated data, indicating that expert knowledge was applied to accurately label the collected images. While the exact methods for data collection are not specified, it can be inferred that they involve capturing images of sub-alpine shrub species in different seasons and applying expert knowledge to correctly identify and label them.
