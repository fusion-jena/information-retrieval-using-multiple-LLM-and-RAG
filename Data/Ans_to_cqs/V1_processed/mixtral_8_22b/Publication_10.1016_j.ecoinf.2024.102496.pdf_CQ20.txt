The given context does not provide information on the specific hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware resources were utilized based solely on the provided text.

Based on the context, we can only infer that a decision support tool has been developed for equitable nutrient reduction in Florida watersheds. This tool uses geospatial analysis to assess pollutant loads from urban land use across different watersheds. However, there is no mention of any deep learning models being employed or the hardware resources used for their training.
