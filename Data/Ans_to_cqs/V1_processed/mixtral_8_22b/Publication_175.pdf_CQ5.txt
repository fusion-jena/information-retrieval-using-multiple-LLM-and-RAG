The text does not explicitly mention specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does refer to using a dataset composed of pairs of labels and images to build an image classification model using a CNN like ResNet. It also mentions that ResNet achieved the best results on the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Competition (ILSVRC) in 2015. Additionally, the text discusses tackling the issue of having a very limited dataset, typically only 1-5 thumbnails per class, by either augmenting the existing data or changing the classification algorithm to use few-shot learning methods.
