The text does not provide explicit details about any preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the authors modified BatNet and optimized the parameter settings of the batch size. They also added new kinds of BNorm layers behind the 22 convolutional layers to prevent overfitting during training. The batch size was set to limit the number of images processed at once due to limited computer resources. In this case, the batch size was set to 128, indicating that 128 images were used for each iteration of the training process. Additionally, the authors mention that they trained the model using a training dataset containing 111,244 images, but there is no information regarding any specific preprocessing steps applied to these images prior to training.
