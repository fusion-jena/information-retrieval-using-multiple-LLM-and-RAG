The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model include the Optimizer, Learning Rate, Batch Size, Epochs, Dropout Rate, and Loss Function. Specifically, the values assigned to these parameters are ADAM for the Optimizer, 0.003 for the Learning Rate, 32 for the Batch Size, 100 for the Epochs, 0.5 for the Dropout Rate, and Binary Cross Entropy for the Loss Function.
