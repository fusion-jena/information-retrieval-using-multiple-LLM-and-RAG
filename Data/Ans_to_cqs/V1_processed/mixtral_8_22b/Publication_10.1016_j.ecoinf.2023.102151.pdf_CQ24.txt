The provided context does not directly address the specific strategies used to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, including managing random seed values. However, it can be inferred that one strategy to manage randomness is by applying a probability function, often a normal distribution, during growth steps. This allows for a degree of randomness while still maintaining a preference for a particular direction. Additionally, limiting the overall size of the root system through a global radius helps maintain some level of control over the process. While these strategies may not directly relate to handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, they illustrate how incorporating probabilistic functions and setting boundaries can help manage uncertainty and randomness in computational processes.
