The context does not provide specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of high-resolution images for classification tasks and the consideration of real-time field challenges during image acquisition. This suggests that image data collection could be one method employed in the process. Additionally, the mention of training models on benchmark datasets implies the use of publicly available datasets. Without further context, it cannot be determined if other methods such as surveys or sensor data were utilized.
