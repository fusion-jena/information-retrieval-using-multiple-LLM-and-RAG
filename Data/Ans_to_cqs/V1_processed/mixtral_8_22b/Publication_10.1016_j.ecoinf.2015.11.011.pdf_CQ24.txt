The given context does not provide information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, there are several strategies commonly employed to manage randomness in such scenarios. One approach is fixing the random seed value before training the model, ensuring reproducibility and consistency in results. Another method involves performing multiple runs with different seeds and averaging the outcomes to reduce variability caused by random initialization. Additionally, techniques like ensemble methods can leverage diverse predictions from various initializations to improve overall performance.
