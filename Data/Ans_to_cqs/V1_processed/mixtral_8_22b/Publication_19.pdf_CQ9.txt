After reviewing the given context, it appears there is no explicit mention of where the data repository for the deep learning pipeline is located or which specific platform it can be found on, such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I am unable to provide a definitive answer based solely on the provided information. It would be helpful if more details about the project or additional resources could be shared so that a more accurate response can be determined.
