Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps may be required depending on the type of data being used. In the given context, the focus is on audio data, specifically bird songs. The software code mentioned in the text is written in Python 3 for audio preprocessing. However, the specific preprocessing techniques applied to the audio data are not explicitly stated in the provided context. Generally, common preprocessing steps for audio data include noise reduction, normalization, and segmentation. Noise reduction involves removing unwanted sounds or background noise from the audio recordings. Normalization scales the amplitude of the audio signals to a standard range, typically between -1 and 1. Segmentation divides the continuous audio stream into smaller segments or frames, allowing the model to learn local patterns within the audio data. Additionally, spectrogram generation is mentioned in the context, which converts the raw audio waveform into a visual representation of frequency over time. This step is crucial for feeding the audio data into a convolutional neural network (CNN) since it allows the model to analyze both temporal and spectral features simultaneously.
