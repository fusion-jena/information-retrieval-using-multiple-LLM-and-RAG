The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This can be determined from Figure 3, which shows a schematic representation of the CNN used in the study. Additionally, the text mentions that several standard forms of deep-learning CNN architectures were tested, further confirming the use of a CNN.
