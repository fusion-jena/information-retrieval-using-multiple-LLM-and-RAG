The text does not explicitly mention any specific method for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, one could infer that various types of data might be collected using different techniques such as surveys, sensors, or utilizing publicly available datasets. For instance, the study mentions the use of spectral data from PlanetScope, which suggests the utilization of satellite imagery data. Additionally, the paper discusses the application of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests (RF) classifiers, indicating the potential use of machine learning algorithms for processing and analyzing the collected data. Nevertheless, without explicit information about the data collection process, this remains speculative.
