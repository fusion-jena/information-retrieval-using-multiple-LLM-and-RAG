The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of a held-out test set and a validation set. The held-out test set was created by randomly sampling 50 regions of interest (ROIs) per species with 'presence'. This set was used for accuracy assessment. The remaining ROIs with species presence were utilized to fine-tune the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. From these, 100 ROIs per species were randomly selected to form a validation set. The rest formed the training set. The validation set was likely used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, while the training set was used to train the model. Different vocalizations for a given species were combined into a single class per species. Overlapping ROIs from different pattern-matching runs for a given species were placed in the training set to avoid temporal autocorrelation in the validation and test data.
