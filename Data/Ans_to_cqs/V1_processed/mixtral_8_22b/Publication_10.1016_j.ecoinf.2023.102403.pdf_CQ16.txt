The table provided does not contain information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete or any reference to a validation loss plateau. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer based on the given context. However, common criteria used to determine when training is complete include reaching a certain number of epochs, achieving a desired level of accuracy or loss, or observing no further improvement in performance metrics over several epochs.
