Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no information about any specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the postprocessing steps related to the mentioned study. However, generally speaking, some common postprocessing steps include evaluating the performance of the trained models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc.; creating confusion matrices to visualize the performance of classification models; generating saliency maps to understand the importance of different features in making predictions; and performing cross-validation to ensure the robustness of the models.
