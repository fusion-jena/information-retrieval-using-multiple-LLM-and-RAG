Based on the given context, there is no explicit information about the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention that the Random Forest Classifier (RFC) was used to obtain the probability of development and the contribution of drivers for each land category. Additionally, the number of decision trees was set to 20, the number of features used to train the random forest to 9, and the number of parallels to 12 to improve the execution speed. These settings could potentially help monitor the model performance during training by providing insights into the accuracy and efficiency of the model. Nonetheless, without more detailed information, it is not possible to definitively state what specific strategy was employed to monitor the model performance during training.
