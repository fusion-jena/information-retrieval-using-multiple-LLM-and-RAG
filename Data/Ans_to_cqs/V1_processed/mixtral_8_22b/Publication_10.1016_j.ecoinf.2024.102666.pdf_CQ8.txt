The given context does not provide information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only discusses various methods used for atmospheric correction in satellite imagery analysis, such as Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes (FLAASH), single scattering approximation, and artificial neural networks (ANN). However, it does not mention any specific code repositories or links to them. Therefore, based on this context alone, we cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
