The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does indicate that acquiring a sufficient amount of training data for deep learning models can be challenging due to factors like cost, logistical difficulties, and time constraints. This suggests that the collection process may involve various methods such as field surveys, sensor deployments, or accessing publicly available datasets. In the case of wetland mapping, satellite or airborne remote sensing could potentially be employed to gather image data. Nonetheless, without explicit information on the data collection methods used in this study, I cannot provide a definitive answer.
