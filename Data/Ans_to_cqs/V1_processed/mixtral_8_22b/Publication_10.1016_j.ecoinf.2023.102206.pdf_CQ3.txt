The given context does not provide specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge, there are several commonly used data annotation techniques in deep learning pipelines such as bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and landmark annotation. Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest in images or videos. Semantic segmentation involves labeling each pixel in an image with a class label, while instance segmentation involves identifying individual instances of objects within an image. Polygon annotation involves outlining complex shapes with vertices, while key point annotation involves marking specific points on objects of interest. Landmark annotation involves identifying specific facial features such as eyes, nose, and mouth. These annotations help in training deep learning models for various applications such as object detection, image segmentation, pose estimation, and facial recognition.
