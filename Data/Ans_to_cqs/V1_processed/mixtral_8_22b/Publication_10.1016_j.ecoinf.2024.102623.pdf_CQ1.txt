The provided context does not explicitly mention specific methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the references to diverse datasets and the use of remote sensing in the Geolifeclef 2023 challenge that various sources may be employed. These could include surveys, sensors, and public datasets. For instance, Botella et al. (2023) discuss the use of high spatial resolution remote sensing data for predicting species composition at continental scales. Similarly, Brown et al. (2020) highlight the application of deep learning methods on large datasets, which could potentially encompass publicly available information. Nevertheless, without explicit details regarding the collection process, it remains speculative to pinpoint exact methods for gathering raw data within the described deep learning framework.
