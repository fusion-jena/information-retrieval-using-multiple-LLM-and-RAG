The text does not provide explicit information about addressing data bias specifically during the preprocessing stage of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention several approaches relevant to handling biases in biodiversity datasets when fitting species distribution models (SDMs), which could potentially be applied during preprocessing.

One approach mentioned is using dataset-specific weights or factor interactions to account for differences in included datasets. This technique might help mitigate biases arising from variations in data sources or collection methods. Additionally, the text suggests integrating prior knowledge of a species' biology into SDMs through priors or offsets, effectively "nudging" response functions toward more realistic outcomes. While this method doesn't directly address data bias, it may indirectly improve predictions by accounting for known biological factors.

Although not explicitly stated, stratified splitting – dividing data based on class labels to ensure equal representation in training and test sets – could be employed to handle imbalanced classes within biodiversity datasets. Similarly, oversampling or undersampling techniques might be utilized to balance the number of instances between classes, reducing potential biases caused by uneven distributions.

Lastly, the importance of diverse data collection is emphasized, as the text mentions that considering all available data is one of the primary goals of model-based integration. By incorporating various data sources and types, researchers can minimize biases stemming from overreliance on limited or homogeneous datasets.
