Based on the given context, it appears that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline discussed here is images. The text mentions EfficientNetV2, a type of convolutional neural network designed primarily for image processing tasks such as object detection and image classification. Furthermore, the context discusses techniques like depth-wise separable convolutions and inverted residuals, both of which are commonly used in image processing applications. However, it should be noted that while the context focuses on image data, deep learning pipelines can use various other types of data formats including audio, video, and structured data like CSV files depending on the specific application and problem being addressed.
