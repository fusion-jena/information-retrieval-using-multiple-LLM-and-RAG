The text does not explicitly state the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions that all pre-trained models under Approach 1 converged the training after 1000 epochs with stochastic gradient descent with momentum (SGDM) as the optimization algorithm. This suggests that the number of epochs or iterations could be one criterion used to determine when training is complete. Additionally, since SGDM is mentioned as the optimization algorithm, it can be inferred that the convergence of the optimization process might also serve as a criterion for determining when training is complete.
