Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps may be involved depending on the specific requirements of the dataset and the chosen model architecture. In this case, the authors mention two main preprocessing steps: resizing and image augmentation.

Firstly, they resize all images to 224 x 224 pixels prior to training. This step ensures that each input image has consistent dimensions, which is essential for most convolutional neural networks (CNNs) like the ResNet50 architecture used here. By having uniform input sizes, the CNN can effectively learn spatial hierarchies of features across the entire dataset.

Secondly, the authors apply image augmentation techniques such as shifts, horizontal flips, rotations, zooms, and shears. Image augmentation helps increase the size of the training dataset artificially by creating modified versions of existing images. These modifications introduce variations into the dataset, making the model more robust and generalizable. For instance, applying random transformations like rotation and zoom can help the model recognize objects even when presented in various orientations or scales.

While not explicitly mentioned in the given context, other common preprocessing steps for deep learning models may include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization involves adjusting pixel values so that they fall within a specified range (usually between 0 and 1), while scaling refers to changing the scale of pixel intensities. Cleaning entails removing noise or irrelevant information from the images, such as background elements unrelated to the target object.

In summary, the primary preprocessing steps discussed in the given context involve resizing images to a standard dimension and employing image augmentation techniques to enhance the diversity of the training dataset. Other potential preprocessing steps for deep learning models could encompass normalization, scaling, and cleaning, although these are not specifically addressed in the provided text.
