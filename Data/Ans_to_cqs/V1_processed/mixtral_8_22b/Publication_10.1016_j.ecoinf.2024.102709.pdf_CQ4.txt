Unfortunately, there is no explicit mention of any specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, or scaling being applied in the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive list of data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline based on the information provided. However, it is common practice to use various data augmentation techniques during the training phase of deep learning models to improve their performance and generalization capabilities.
