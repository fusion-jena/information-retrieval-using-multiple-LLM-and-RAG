Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to determine what specific hardware resources were used for training the deep learning model. The text only mentions the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN), dropout regularization, ADAM optimization, and the number of epochs and batch size used for training. It does not provide any details about the type or number of processing units (GPUs, TPUs, etc.) utilized for the computational tasks involved in training the model.
