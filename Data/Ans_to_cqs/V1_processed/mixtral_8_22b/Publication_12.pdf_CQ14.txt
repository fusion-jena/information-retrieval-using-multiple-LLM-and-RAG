Based on the given context, it appears that the authors have not explicitly mentioned how the hyperparameters of their model were optimized, such as through techniques like grid search or random search. However, they do mention adjusting certain parameters, including the batch size, which was set to 128. This suggests that some form of manual tuning may have been used to find optimal values for these parameters. It would be best to consult the original research paper or contact the authors directly for more specific details about the optimization process.
