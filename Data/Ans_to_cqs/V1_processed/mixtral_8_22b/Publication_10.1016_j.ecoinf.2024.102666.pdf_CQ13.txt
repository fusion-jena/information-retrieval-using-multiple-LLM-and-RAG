The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model such as learning rate or optimizer. However, it discusses the application of artificial neural networks (ANNs), specifically the Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes (FLAASH) model, in atmospheric correction for various aquatic environments. The FLAASH model was initially developed for land pixels but has shown effectiveness in aquatic environments using Sentinel-2 and SPOT-6 imagery. Furthermore, the FLAASH algorithm employs an internal pixel averaging technique to mitigate the spatial proximity effect, contributing to achieving high-quality atmospheric correction.

In terms of deep learning models, common hyperparameters include learning rate, optimizer, batch size, number of epochs, and others depending on the specific architecture being used. Learning rate determines how much the weights should be updated with respect to the loss gradient during training. Optimizers like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, or RMSprop help minimize the loss function more efficiently. Batch size refers to the number of samples processed before updating the model weights, while the number of epochs indicates the total number of times the entire dataset is passed through the model during training.

Since the context does not provide explicit information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, I cannot give a definitive answer regarding the learning rate, optimizer, or other hyperparameters employed in this particular case.
