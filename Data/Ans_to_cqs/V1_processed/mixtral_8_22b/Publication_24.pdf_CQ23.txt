To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the study used a diverse dataset consisting of audio data collected over long time periods and large areas. This allowed for the inspection of the level of biotic and anthropogenic activity at different times of day, providing a comprehensive representation of the urban ecosystem.

Secondly, the study employed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a type of deep learning model known for its ability to automatically learn and select features that best discriminate between different classes in a dataset. This was done based on the annotations in the training dataset, allowing the model to leverage large quantities of training data.

Thirdly, the study applied different normalization strategies to enhance the accuracy of the network. These strategies included mean subtraction, variance scaling, and batch normalization. The combination of these strategies resulted in significant improvements to network accuracy compared to any single normalization scheme in isolation.

Lastly, the machine learning pipeline was implemented using Python and various libraries such as Theano, Lasagne, and Librosa. This ensured that the model was built on robust and well-established tools, further contributing to its reliability and generalizability. However, it should be noted that while these measures contribute to the generalizability of the model, they do not guarantee perfect performance across all possible scenarios or environments.
