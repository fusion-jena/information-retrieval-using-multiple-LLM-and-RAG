The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves checking the training loss every 50 epochs. Training continues until the value of the loss function fails to decrease in two consecutive checks. At this point, the training stops, and the model with the optimal objective function value is selected. This approach ensures that the model does not overfit the training data and maintains good generalization performance.
