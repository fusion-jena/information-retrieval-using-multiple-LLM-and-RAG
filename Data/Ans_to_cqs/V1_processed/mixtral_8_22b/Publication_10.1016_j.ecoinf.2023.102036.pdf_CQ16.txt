The text does not explicitly state the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions that each optimization run consisted of 3000 train iterations with a batch size of 25 individuals, picking a pair of similar and a pair of dissimilar photos. Additionally, the model was validated every 300 iterations. These details suggest that the completion of training might have been determined based on reaching a predefined number of training iterations or epochs. It is also possible that other criteria such as validation loss plateau could have been considered, but these are not mentioned in the given context.
