Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, common practices in machine learning include monitoring metrics like validation loss during training. When the validation loss stops decreasing significantly or plateaus, it can indicate that the model has learned all it can from the training data and further training may lead to overfitting. Other possible criteria could involve setting a maximum number of epochs or using early stopping methods based on performance thresholds. Without additional context, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the exact criteria used in this case.
