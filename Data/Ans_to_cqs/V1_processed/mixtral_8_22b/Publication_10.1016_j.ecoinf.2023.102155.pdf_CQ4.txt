The given context does not provide information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotation, or scaling. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based on the given context.

Based on the given context, it appears that the study focuses on predicting intensity maps using various methods such as knn, kmeans, randomCF, LoopA, LoopT, and LoopE. The authors also mention implementing lasso regularization and bias correction. However, there is no mention of any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
