Unfortunately, there is no explicit mention of the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model in the given context. Therefore, it cannot be determined how the model was deployed, whether it was serialized or if a particular platform was selected for deployment. However, we can infer that the model was likely deployed after being trained on the ASUS laptop mentioned in section 2.7, which had an Intel i7-11370H CPU, 16GB DDR4 memory, and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 graphics card. After training, the model could have been saved and then loaded onto another device or system for deployment. But without more details, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer.
