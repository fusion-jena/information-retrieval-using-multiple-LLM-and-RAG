Unfortunately, based on the given information, it does not explicitly state where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it mentions the use of the iNaturalist database and the TRY database. The iNaturalist database provides a worldwide record of millions of plant photographs including taxa and geolocations, while the TRY database contains more than 11 million trait measurements across more than 270,000 taxa. It would be best to refer to the original research paper or contact the authors directly to find out about the availability of their deep learning pipeline's data repository.
