The query asks about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, specifically regarding random seed values. However, the provided context does not directly address this topic. Instead, it discusses the application of random forest models in estimating fungal productivity patterns under various environmental conditions and climate change scenarios. Therefore, I am unable to provide a direct answer to the query using the given information.

However, generally speaking, there are several strategies to manage randomness in deep learning pipelines:

1. Fixing Seeds: One common approach is to fix the seed value for all random processes involved in the pipeline, including weight initialization, batch ordering, and dropout regularization. By fixing seeds, researchers ensure reproducibility and consistency across experiments.

2. Ensemble Methods: Another strategy involves training multiple models with different initializations or architectures and combining their predictions through ensemble methods like bagging or boosting. This helps reduce variance and improve overall performance.

3. Data Augmentation: Applying diverse transformations to input data during training can also help mitigate the impact of randomness. Techniques such as rotation, scaling, cropping, and flipping can generate new samples, effectively increasing dataset size and reducing overfitting.

4. Regularization Techniques: Employing techniques like L1/L2 regularization, early stopping, or dropout can prevent overfitting caused by random fluctuations in the training process. These methods introduce constraints on model complexity, promoting generalization and robustness.
