The text does not mention any specific dataset used in the deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it mentions using ground data points for machine learning training and employing Red Green Blue (RGB) images acquired in March, April, and May for classification utilizing the random forest technique. Additionally, the text discusses the use of Sentinel-2 satellite images for grassland ecosystems monitoring. Therefore, it appears that the study primarily relied on custom datasets rather than commonly used ones like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
