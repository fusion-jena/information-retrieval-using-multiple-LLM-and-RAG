The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred from Table 3 that the dataset was split into training and validation sets, which could help prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. Additionally, the use of diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting may have been employed but are not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
