The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, based on general practices in machine learning, some common postprocessing steps include evaluating the performance of the trained model using metrics such as R^2 values or mean squared error for continuous responses, confusion matrices for classification problems, and saliency maps for understanding feature importances. Additionally, techniques like cross-validation may be used to ensure the robustness of the model. Furthermore, early stopping might also be applied during the training phase to prevent overfitting by monitoring the validation statistics and halting the training process if no improvement is observed.
