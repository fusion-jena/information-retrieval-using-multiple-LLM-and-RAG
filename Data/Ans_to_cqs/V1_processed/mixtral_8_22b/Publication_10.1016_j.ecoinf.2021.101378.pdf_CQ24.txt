Based on the given context, there isn't any direct mention or discussion about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some common strategies used to address this issue include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, employing techniques like cross-validation, bootstrapping, or bagging to reduce variance, and utilizing ensemble methods to combine multiple models with different initializations. These approaches can help mitigate the impact of randomness and improve overall model performance and stability.
