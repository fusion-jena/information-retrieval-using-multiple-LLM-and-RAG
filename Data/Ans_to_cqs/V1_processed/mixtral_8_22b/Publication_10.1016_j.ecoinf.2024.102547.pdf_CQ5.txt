The query asks about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, but based on the given context, there is no mention of specific datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the context discusses a study that uses a multifrequency acoustics dataset acquired from scientific echosounders in the West African waters. The goal of the study is to investigate the spatial arrangement of marine organism aggregations and examine various attributes such as thickness, relative density, and depth. The study employs fisheries acoustics techniques and functional data analysis, including dimension reduction techniques and supervised and unsupervised methods. Therefore, it can be concluded that the study does not utilize common deep learning datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
