The text mentions several preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model. These include image augmentation techniques such as horizontal flipping, counterclockwise shearing, random zooming, and normalizing the input tensors to ImageNet mean values. Additionally, pixels values were rescaled within the range of [0, 1] to ensure consistent input scales across different images. These preprocessing steps help improve the robustness and generalizability of the deep learning model.
