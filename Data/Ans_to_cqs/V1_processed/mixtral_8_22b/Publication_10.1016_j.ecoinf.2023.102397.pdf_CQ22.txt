The performance of the deep learning model was evaluated using error matrices containing true positives (tp), false positives (fp), false negatives (fn), and true negatives (tn). From these, two main evaluation parameters were derived: precision and recall. Precision is defined as the proportion of recognizer hits that are true detections of the target species [precision = tp / (tp + fp)]. Recall, on the other hand, is the proportion of target species vocalizations detected as hits by a recognizer [recall = tp / (tp + fn)]. To combine both parameters into a single measure, the F-score was calculated with a user-defined metric β that allows prioritizing one parameter over the other. In this study, β = 1 was chosen, giving equal importance to precision and recall.
