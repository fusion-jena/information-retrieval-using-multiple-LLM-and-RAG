Based on the given information, it appears that the study does not use any traditional deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, various datasets related to ecosystem services, climate, and geography have been utilized. These include:

1. Guangzhou Statistical Yearbook and National Grain Trading Centre - Used to calculate the output value per unit area of grain crops in the study area.
2. GlobeLand30 - A global land cover product with a resolution of 30 meters.
3. ALOS World 3D-30m - Provided by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, offering high-quality digital surface models.
4. China Soil Map Based Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD) v1.1 - Contains soil properties and classes globally.
5. MODIS Image MOD13Q1 - Provided by NASA, containing vegetation indices like NDVI.
6. CRU Dataset - Climatic Research Unit Time Series dataset providing monthly climate variables.
7. Geographic Data Sharing Infrastructure, College of Urban and Environmental Science, Peking University - Offers various geospatial datasets.
8. National Earth System Science Data Center - Provides access to earth system science data.

These datasets have been employed to support the research objectives, including analyzing the geographical variability and similarity of ecosystem services, uncovering dominant service functions, and evaluating ecological values of land-use types.
