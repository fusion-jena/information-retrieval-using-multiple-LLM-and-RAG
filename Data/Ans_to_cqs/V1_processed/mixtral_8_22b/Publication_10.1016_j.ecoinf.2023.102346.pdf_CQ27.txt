Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide a detailed response about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, based on the given context, it can be inferred that several machine learning algorithms were utilized for generating predictive models. These included Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), Random Forest (RF), Flexible Discriminant Analysis (FDA), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Generalized Boosting regression Model (GBM), and Maximum-Entropy learning (MAXENT).

To evaluate these models, various metrics such as AUC, ROC, TSS, KAPPA, and COR values were considered. The'shiny' package in RStudio was employed to extract model mean performances. Additionally, the'sdm', 'dismo', 'bioclim', and 'biomod2' packages were also mentioned, suggesting their potential use in this study.

However, without explicit details regarding the specifics of the deep learning model deployment, it cannot be definitively stated how the trained model was deployed. It could have been through model serialization, where the model is saved and then loaded when needed, or by selecting a suitable platform for deployment. But again, without further context, this remains speculative.
