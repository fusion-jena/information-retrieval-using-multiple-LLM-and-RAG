The text does not explicitly mention the specific purpose or task of the deep learning model, such as classification, segmentation, or detection. However, it can be inferred from the context that the deep learning model is being used for regression purposes. This is evident when the authors compare the performance of their proposed deep learning model with a Random Forest (RF) regression model. Additionally, the authors discuss how deep learning networks can handle complex nonlinear and multivariate regression problems. Based on this information, it can be concluded that the deep learning model is likely designed for regression tasks.
