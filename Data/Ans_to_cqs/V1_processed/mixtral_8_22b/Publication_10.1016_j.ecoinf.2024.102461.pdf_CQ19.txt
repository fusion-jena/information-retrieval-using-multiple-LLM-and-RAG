Based on the given information, it does not explicitly state which specific frameworks were used to build the deep learning models mentioned in the text. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other particular framework was utilized. However, it is clear from the context that various modeling techniques, including deep learning, were applied to refine fire risk maps in forest ecosystems using diverse remote sensing data with high spatial resolution.

To summarize, while we do know that deep learning methods were employed in creating fire risk maps, there is no explicit mention of the exact frameworks used, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
