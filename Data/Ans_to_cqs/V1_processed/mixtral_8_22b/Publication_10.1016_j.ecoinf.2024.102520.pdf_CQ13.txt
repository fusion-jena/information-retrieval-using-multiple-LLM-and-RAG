Unfortunately, there is no information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model in the given context. The context mainly discusses image acquisition and processing, including equations for calculating Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Square Error (MSE), and the G parameter. It also includes Table 6 with R2 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values for different land uses and variables. However, it does not mention anything about the specifics of a deep learning model or its hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer.
