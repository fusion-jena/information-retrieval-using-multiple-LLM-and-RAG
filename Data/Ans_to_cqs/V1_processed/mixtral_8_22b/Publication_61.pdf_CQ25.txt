The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is primarily for image classification tasks. Specifically, the model is employed for plant identification and classification, including differentiation between various legume species like white beans, red beans, and soybeans. Additionally, the model is utilized for detecting diseases affecting plants. Furthermore, the deep learning model is applied for recognizing specific types of plants, such as cacti, in aerial images. The primary goal of using these deep learning models is to leverage their ability to automatically learn and extract relevant features directly from input images during the training phase, which often results in superior performance compared to traditional machine learning methods.
