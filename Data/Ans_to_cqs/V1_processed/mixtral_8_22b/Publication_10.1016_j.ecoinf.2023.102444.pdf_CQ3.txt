Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to provide a detailed answer about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, I can give you some general insights into common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. These include:

1. Bounding Box Annotation: This technique involves drawing boxes around objects in images to help train object detection algorithms. Each box contains metadata related to the object it encloses.

2. Semantic Segmentation: In semantic segmentation, each pixel in an image is assigned a class label. This helps in understanding the overall scene better.

3. Instance Segmentation: Similar to semantic segmentation, instance segmentation assigns a class label to every pixel. But unlike semantic segmentation, it identifies each object instance separately.

4. Polygon Annotation: This method is used when the shape of the object is irregular. Here, polygons are drawn along the edges of the object.

5. Landmark Annotation: Also known as key point annotation, landmarks are used to define important features of an object. They are often used in facial recognition systems.

6. Line Annotation: Used mainly in autonomous vehicle training datasets, line annotations are used to mark lanes, roads, etc.

Again, without more specific details about the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context, it's not possible to determine which of these techniques were used.
