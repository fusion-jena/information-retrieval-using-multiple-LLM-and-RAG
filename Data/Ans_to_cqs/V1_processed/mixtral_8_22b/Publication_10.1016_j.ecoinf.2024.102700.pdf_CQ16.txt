The study does not provide specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions that various methods of model validation were used, including internal validation strategies and external validation methods. The most commonly used validation metric was the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC curve). In some cases, multiple validation metrics were used simultaneously to assess different aspects of model performance. Unfortunately, there is no clear indication of how these validation methods were used to determine when training should be stopped. Therefore, based on the available information, it cannot be determined what criteria are used to determine when training is complete.
