Based on the given information, it appears that the study uses a combination of frequency-reassigned spectrogram images and a deep convolutional neural network (ResNet-50) for feature extraction and classification. However, there is no explicit mention of specific data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the data annotation techniques used in this particular deep learning pipeline.
