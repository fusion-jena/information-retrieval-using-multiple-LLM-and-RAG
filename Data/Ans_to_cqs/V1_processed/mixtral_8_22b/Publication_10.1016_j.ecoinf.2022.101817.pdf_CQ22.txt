Three main metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models in this study: accuracy, precision, and recall.

Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions made by the model out of the total number of instances. It can be expressed as a percentage or a fraction. In Table 4, we see that the accuracy of Model 4 is 99.2%, while Model 5 has an accuracy of 98.9%.

Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made by the model. A higher precision indicates fewer false positives. Precision is also known as the positive predictive value. In Table 4, we see that Model 4 has a precision of 97.5%, while Model 5 has a precision of 96.8%.

Recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances. A higher recall indicates fewer false negatives. Recall is also known as sensitivity or true positive rate. In Table 4, we see that Model 4 has a recall of 97.5%, while Model 5 has a recall of 96.8%.

In addition to these three metrics, another metric called the F1 score is used to provide a balance between precision and recall. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. In Figure 7, we see that the F1 scores of Models 4 and 5 are 97.5% and 96.8%, respectively.
