The given context does not provide explicit information on the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on common practices in deep learning applications related to wildlife monitoring and conservation, such as those mentioned in the context (e.g., detection of penguin guano or surveying seabird colonies using drone imagery), it can be inferred that some commonly used data annotation techniques might have been employed. These could include:

1. Object Detection: This technique involves drawing bounding boxes around objects of interest within an image. In the case of wildlife monitoring, this could involve identifying individual animals or groups of animals within a larger scene.

2. Instance Segmentation: This is a more precise form of object detection where each pixel in an image is classified according to the object it belongs to. This allows for more accurate identification of individual instances of objects within a scene.

3. Semantic Segmentation: Similar to instance segmentation, but instead of differentiating between individual instances of objects, all pixels belonging to the same class are grouped together. This could be useful for distinguishing between different types of terrain or habitats in a landscape.

Again, without explicit mention in the provided context, these are only speculative possibilities based on typical practices in similar fields.
