The given context does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the type of optimizer employed. However, it mentions that a Bayesian optimizer controls the output of each CNN in the proposed FAA-based approach. Additionally, the text discusses various techniques used to improve the performance of deep learning models, such as attention mechanisms and data augmentation, but it does not explicitly mention any specific hyperparameter settings.
