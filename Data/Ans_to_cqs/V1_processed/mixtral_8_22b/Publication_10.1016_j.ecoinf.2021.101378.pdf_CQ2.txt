Based on the given context, it is not explicitly mentioned what specific data format was used in their deep learning pipeline. However, they did mention that all values of their dataset were extracted from digital maps using the ArcGIS 10.1 software. This suggests that the data could be in a spatial or raster format such as GeoTIFF or other similar formats commonly used in GIS applications. They also listed several environmental variables which include both geographical and meteorological factors, indicating that the data might have been collected from various sources and possibly in different formats before being processed into a single dataset. Therefore, without further details about their preprocessing steps, it cannot be definitively determined what exact data format was used in their deep learning pipeline.
