To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed. One common approach is fixing the random seed value, which ensures reproducibility of results across different runs or experiments. This can be done using functions like numpy.random.seed() or tensorflow.random.set_seed(). Another strategy is to use deterministic algorithms instead of stochastic ones wherever possible. For example, using a deterministic optimizer such as gradient descent instead of a stochastic one like Adam. Additionally, techniques such as cross-validation and bootstrapping can also help reduce the impact of randomness on model performance. Cross-validation involves splitting the dataset into multiple subsets and training the model on each subset separately, while bootstrapping involves resampling the dataset with replacement to create new datasets for training and testing. These methods provide more robust estimates of model accuracy and generalization ability. Finally, it is important to report any sources of randomness in the experimental setup and discuss their potential impact on the results.
