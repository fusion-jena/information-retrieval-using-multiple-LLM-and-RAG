Based on the given context, it is not explicitly mentioned what specific methods are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer that video recordings or images might be one source of raw data since the study mentions extracting frames from videos. Additionally, the use of ImageNet, which is a large-scale hierarchical image database, suggests that publicly available datasets could also serve as sources of raw data. The paper by Dwivedi (2021) discusses the role of digital technology in freshwater biodiversity monitoring through citizen science, indicating that crowdsourced data collection may also play a part in gathering raw data.
