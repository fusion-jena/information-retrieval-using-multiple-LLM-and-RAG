The text does not provide explicit information on the specific purpose of the deep learning model being used. However, it mentions several machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and others, which are commonly used for tasks like classification, regression, clustering, etc. Without more context, it cannot be definitively stated what the exact purpose of the deep learning model is.

Based on the context provided, it can be inferred that the study might involve some form of spatial analysis or prediction related to environmental factors and protected areas. This could suggest that the deep learning model might be used for tasks like image segmentation (to identify different types of land cover), object detection (to locate specific features within images), or even classification (to categorize different regions based on their characteristics). But without further details, this remains speculative.
