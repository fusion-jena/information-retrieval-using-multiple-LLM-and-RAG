Based on the given context, it appears that after selecting the VGG16 network as the best performing algorithm among the three tested deep learning models, the authors used this network for tree species classification. However, the specific details regarding the deployment of the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection, are not explicitly stated in the provided information. Therefore, I cannot provide a precise answer to the query about the exact process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
