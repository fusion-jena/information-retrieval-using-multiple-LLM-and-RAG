The performance of the deep learning models was evaluated using several metrics such as Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, Precision, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into different aspects of the model's performance. For instance, Accuracy indicates the overall correctness of the model, while Sensitivity (also known as Recall) shows how well the model identifies true positives. On the other hand, Specificity reveals the model's ability to correctly identify true negatives. Furthermore, Precision demonstrates the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made by the model. Lastly, the F1-score provides a single score that balances both Precision and Recall, offering a more comprehensive view of the model's performance.
