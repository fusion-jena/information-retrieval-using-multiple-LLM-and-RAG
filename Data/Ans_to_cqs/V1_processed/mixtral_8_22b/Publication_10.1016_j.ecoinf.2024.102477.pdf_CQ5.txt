The provided context does not mention any specific dataset used in the deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it is mentioned that deep learning methods are being widely applied to create models directly from large volumes of complex data. Additionally, it is stated that these methods have superior performance for time-series prediction compared to many other models. Specifically, the context mentions two case studies where SLSTM and SGRU models were used for different applications - one for predicting agricultural product sales and the other for predicting the Pacific decadal oscillation index. Unfortunately, no information about the datasets used in these case studies is provided. Therefore, based on the given context, we cannot determine which datasets were used in the deep learning pipeline.
