Based on the given context, the criteria used to determine when training is complete involve conducting training and forecasts progressively by changing the starting time of the forecast but not using the information that is not accessible at the start of prediction period. Each forecast is assured to be a fair cross-validation. The prediction error is obtained by calculating the difference between the predicted value and the validation data at different starting times. This approach ensures that each forecast is a fair cross-validation, indicating that the training process is complete when the prediction error is minimized across various starting times. However, the specific criterion for determining when the prediction error is sufficiently small to consider the training complete is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
