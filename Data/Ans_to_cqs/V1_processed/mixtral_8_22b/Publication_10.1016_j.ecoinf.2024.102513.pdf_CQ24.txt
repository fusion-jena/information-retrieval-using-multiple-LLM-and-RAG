The provided context does not directly address strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing the impact of random seed values. However, some related concepts can be discussed.

Deep learning models like CNNs rely on optimization algorithms, often employing backpropagation and gradient descent methods to update their weights during training. These processes involve inherently stochastic elements, including initial weight initialization and mini-batch selection. Random seeds help ensure reproducibility across experiments by controlling these sources of randomness.

To manage the effects of randomness due to factors like random seed values, researchers may adopt several strategies:

1. **Seed Fixing**: Setting a fixed random seed ensures consistent results across multiple runs of the same experiment. While this approach promotes reproducibility, it might limit the exploration of diverse solutions and potentially lead to suboptimal performance if the chosen seed is unlucky.

2. **Ensemble Methods**: Training multiple instances of the same model with varying random seeds and combining their predictions can improve overall performance and robustness. Ensembling reduces sensitivity to individual seed choices and captures more diverse representations of the problem space.

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, or regularization strength, can mitigate the influence of random seeds. Grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization techniques can identify optimal configurations that yield better performance regardless of specific seed values.

4. **Data Augmentation**: Expanding the dataset via transformations like rotations, flips, or noise injection introduces additional variations, making the model less sensitive to any particular seed choice. Data augmentation also encourages the development of more robust feature representations.
