Based on the provided context, it does not explicitly mention any specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model, such as accuracy, precision, or recall. However, it discusses remotely sensed metrics that may be defined and analyzed along time series for each multispectral imagery. These metrics could include formulas useful in applied ecology to infer biophysical characteristics of the environment. Examples of these metrics are listed in Supplementary Information S1.1 and Montero et al. (2023). Additionally, the context mentions customizing metric variants and introducing entirely novel metrics using the compute\_metrics function. Therefore, while the context does not directly address the evaluation metrics for a deep learning model, it provides insights into the types of metrics that might be considered when working with remote sensing data in the field of ecology.
