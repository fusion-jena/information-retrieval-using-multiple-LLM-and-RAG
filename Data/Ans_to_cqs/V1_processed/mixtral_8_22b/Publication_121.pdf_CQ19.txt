The deep learning model is built using the TensorFlow library along with OpenCV-Python3 and Keras. TensorFlow is an open-source platform for machine learning and artificial intelligence applications. It provides a comprehensive ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML powered applications. OpenCV-Python3 is a library of computer vision functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. Keras is a high-level neural networks API written in Python that runs on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation.
