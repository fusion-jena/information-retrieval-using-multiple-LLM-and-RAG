Based on the given context, it is not explicitly stated which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the authors utilized Google Earth Engine (GEE) for their data processing needs due to its ability to provide high performance and rapid planetary scale processing and analysis of images. GEE is a cloud processing platform developed by Google, but it does not necessarily mean that they also deployed their deep learning models on this same platform or any other specific platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. Therefore, without further information, it cannot be definitively determined which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
