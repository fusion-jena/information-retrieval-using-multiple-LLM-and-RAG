After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be taken to evaluate the performance of the models and gain insights into their predictions. Some common postprocessing steps include:

1. Calculating Performance Metrics: After training the models, various performance metrics can be calculated to assess how well they have learned to classify images. These metrics may include sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1-score, and accuracy. In Tables I and II, these metrics are reported for different models applied to two datasets, namely UBD\_45 and VP\_200.
2. Creating Confusion Matrix: Another useful tool for evaluating the performance of a model is creating a confusion matrix. This matrix shows the number of true positives, false negatives, false positives, and true negatives predicted by the model. It provides insight into which classes the model has difficulty distinguishing between.
3. Generating Saliency Maps: To understand what features the model is focusing on when making its predictions, saliency maps can be generated. These maps highlight the regions of an image that contribute most significantly to the final prediction made by the model. They provide valuable information about the decision-making process of the model.
4. Visualizing Predictions: Finally, visualizations of the predictions made by the model can also be helpful in understanding its behavior. By plotting the output probabilities or activations of certain neurons, one can see how confidently the model predicts each class and identify any patterns or biases in its predictions.

These postprocessing steps help researchers better understand the strengths and weaknesses of their models and improve them further.
