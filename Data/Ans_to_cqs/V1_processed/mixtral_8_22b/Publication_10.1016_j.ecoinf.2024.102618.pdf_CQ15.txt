The given context does not provide information about the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine what optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), or others have been applied in the deep learning pipeline.
