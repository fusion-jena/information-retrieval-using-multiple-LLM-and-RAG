The context does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, common practices include splitting the dataset randomly, stratified sampling, or time series split when dealing with temporal data. It is also important to ensure that the splits maintain the same distribution as the original dataset to avoid bias during training and evaluation.
