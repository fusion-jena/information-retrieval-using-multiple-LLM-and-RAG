The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, based on the information provided about the model selection procedure, it can be inferred that the deep learning models are used for classification tasks. Specifically, the text mentions that the accuracy of candidate models is measured by the proportion of cases correctly classified. Additionally, the table lists parameters for various deep learning models such as Extreme Gradient Boosting Tree, Random Forest, Neural Network, and Deep Neural Network, which are commonly used for classification tasks. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning models discussed here are likely used for classification purposes.
