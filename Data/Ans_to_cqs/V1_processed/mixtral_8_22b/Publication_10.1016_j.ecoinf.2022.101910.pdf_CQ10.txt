The text does not provide information on the specific code repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in this study. It only mentions that BirdNET uses a developed deep neural network but does not give any details about its implementation or where it can be accessed. Therefore, I do not know the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in this study.
