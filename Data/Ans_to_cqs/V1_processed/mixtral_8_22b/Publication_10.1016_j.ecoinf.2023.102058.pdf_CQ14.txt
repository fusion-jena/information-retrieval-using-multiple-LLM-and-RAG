The hyperparameters of the model were optimized using a grid search method. This is mentioned in the context where it states, "A grid search was used to find the best ntrees (i.e., 500 trees)." Grid search is a technique used in hyperparameter tuning where we define a set of values for each parameter and exhaustively evaluate them to determine the optimal combination. In this case, it was used to find the best number of trees (ntrees) for the model.
