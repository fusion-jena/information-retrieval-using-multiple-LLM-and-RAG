According to the given context, the dataset was divided into training and testing sets using a ratio of 8:2. This means that 80% of the data was allocated for training purposes, while the remaining 20% was reserved for testing. The number of test samples and training samples were 3094 and 12,340, respectively. The performance of the classification models was evaluated based on their accuracy on the test set. However, it should be noted that there is no mention of any validation set in this context. In general, when building machine learning models, including deep learning ones, it is common practice to divide the available data into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to fit the model, the validation set helps tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the testing set provides an unbiased evaluation of the final model.
