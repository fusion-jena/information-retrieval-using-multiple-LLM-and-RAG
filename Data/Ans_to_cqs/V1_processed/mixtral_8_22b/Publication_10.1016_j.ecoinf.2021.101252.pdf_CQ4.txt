The given context does not provide information about specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, some common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, zooming, and shifting. These techniques help increase the size of the dataset and improve the generalization ability of the model. They can be applied to both image and sequence data. For example, in image data, flipping involves reflecting the image horizontally or vertically, while rotation involves rotating the image by a certain degree. Scaling involves changing the size of the image, either enlarging or shrinking it. Cropping involves removing parts of the image, while zooming involves magnifying portions of the image. Shifting involves moving the image along one or more axes. Similarly, for sequence data such as time series, data augmentation techniques may involve adding noise, permutations, magnitude warping, and time warping.
