The context does not provide explicit details about specific preprocessing steps for deep learning models such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it mentions that many machine learning systems use Mel spectrograms with Per-Channel Energy Normalization (PCEN) as acoustic features. Additionally, it discusses how long audio files are divided into shorter chunks to fit within GPU memory limitations during training. These points suggest that feature extraction and segmentation might be common preprocessing steps when working with audio data in deep learning applications.
