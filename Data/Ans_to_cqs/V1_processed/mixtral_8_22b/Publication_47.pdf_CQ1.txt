The paper does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the authors might have used publicly available datasets such as those found on the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) platform. This is suggested by their citation of a study titled "No one-size-fits-all solution to clean GBIF" [Zizka et al., 2020c]. Additionally, they discuss spatial cleaning techniques, which implies that they may have collected spatially explicit data, possibly through GPS coordinates associated with species observations. They also reference studies discussing the use of herbarium specimens [Rivers et al., 2011] and the application of the IUCN Red Listing system [Pfab et al., 2011], suggesting that these sources could potentially contribute to the raw data collection process.
