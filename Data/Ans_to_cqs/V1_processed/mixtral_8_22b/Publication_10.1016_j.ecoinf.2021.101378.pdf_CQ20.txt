Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to determine which specific hardware resources were used for training the deep learning model. The text mentions various machine learning techniques such as artificial neural networks, random forests, and maximum entropy modeling but does not provide any details about the hardware resources employed during the training process. Therefore, it is impossible to definitively state whether GPUs, TPUs, or other types of hardware resources were utilized.
