The given context does not provide information about specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, or scaling applied in a deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses the use of high spatial resolution satellite image data and the selection of high-quality LAI training samples from global LAI products using various methods like homogeneous and pure pixel filter methods and pixel unmixing methods. The study by Zhou et al. (2018) mentioned in the context uses these methods along with the support vector machine (SVR) algorithm to estimate high spatial resolution LAI. Therefore, while the context does not directly address the query regarding data augmentation techniques in a deep learning pipeline, it provides insights into the use of different methods for selecting high-quality training samples for empirical models in estimating high spatial resolution LAI.
