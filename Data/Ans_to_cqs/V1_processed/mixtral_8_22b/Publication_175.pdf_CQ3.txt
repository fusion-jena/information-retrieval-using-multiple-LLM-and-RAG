The text does not provide specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on common practices in deep learning, some possible data annotation techniques include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangles around objects of interest within an image, while semantic segmentation involves labeling each pixel in an image with its corresponding object or region category. Instance segmentation combines these two techniques by identifying individual instances of objects within an image and delineating their boundaries. It is important to note that the choice of data annotation technique depends on the specific requirements of the application and the available resources.
