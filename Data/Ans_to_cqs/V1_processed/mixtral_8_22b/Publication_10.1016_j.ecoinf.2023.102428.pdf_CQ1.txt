The text does not provide explicit information on the method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions two sources that could potentially be used for gathering data: EarthExplorer USGS\footnote{\url{https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/}} and OpenStreetMap\footnote{\url{www.openstreetmap.org/\#map=4/21.84/82.79}}. These platforms offer access to various types of geospatial data, including satellite imagery and vector maps, which can be useful for training machine learning models like MLPs. It should also be noted that the table titled "MLP Parameters and Performance" includes a column labeled "Requested Samples Per Class," suggesting that the authors may have collected or requested specific amounts of data for each category they aimed to classify using their model.
