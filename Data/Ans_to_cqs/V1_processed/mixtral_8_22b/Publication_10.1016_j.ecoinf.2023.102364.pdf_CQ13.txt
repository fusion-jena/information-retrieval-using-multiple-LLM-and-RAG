The given context does not provide any information about the use of a deep learning model or its hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer. Instead, it discusses the application of machine learning ensembles using various established and leading ML algorithms like Random Forest, TreeNet, CART, and MARS. These methods were employed to create an averaged ensemble for predicting Short-billed Gull presence/absence based on a 2014-2015 dataset. Therefore, without additional context, we cannot determine the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model.
