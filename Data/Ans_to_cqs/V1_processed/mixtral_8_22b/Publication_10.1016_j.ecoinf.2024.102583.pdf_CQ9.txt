The given context does not provide information on where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only discusses different machine learning models used for landslide susceptibility mapping, including Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), Na√Øve Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The context also provides details about the dataset used for training these models but does not mention any specific data repositories or platforms where this data might be available. Therefore, I do not have enough information to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
