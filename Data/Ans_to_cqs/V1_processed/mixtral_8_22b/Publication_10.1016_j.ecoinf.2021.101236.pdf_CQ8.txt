The provided context does not explicitly mention where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it is common practice for researchers to share their code repositories on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I would recommend checking these platforms for a repository named 'BirdNET', which corresponds to the name of the deep learning solution presented in the paper. Alternatively, one could contact the authors directly to request access to the code repository.
