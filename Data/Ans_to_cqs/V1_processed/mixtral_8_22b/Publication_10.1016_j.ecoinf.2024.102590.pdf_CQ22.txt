In this study, the authors use several metrics to evaluate the performance of their deep learning model. These metrics include overall accuracy, producer's accuracy, and user's accuracy. Overall accuracy reflects the percentage of correctly classified pixels in a map, while producer's accuracy measures the correctness of reference pixel classification. On the other hand, user's accuracy indicates how accurately the classification represents actual ground conditions. It should be noted that these metrics are commonly used in remote sensing and geospatial analysis to evaluate the performance of machine learning models. However, depending on the specific application and requirements, other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score may also be relevant.
