To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures have been implemented. Firstly, the active learning experiments were conducted in the embedding space of the selected transfer learning model called BirdNet-1. This model has been chosen due to its proven effectiveness in handling various audio tasks, including bird sound recognition. Secondly, a wide range of sampling strategies were explored, which included uncertainty and diversity-based approaches, myopic (greedy) and adaptive (batch mode) techniques, along with combinations of these strategies. These diverse sampling methods helped capture a broad spectrum of data points, thereby enhancing the robustness and applicability of the model across different scenarios. Thirdly, the experiment involved both focal and citizen-science datasets, further contributing to the model's ability to handle varied sources of information. Lastly, the authors mentioned evaluating the transfer learning models based on classification performance, indicating the use of standard validation practices like cross-validation or stratified splitting, although specific details about these processes are not explicitly stated in the provided context.
