Based on the given context, there isn't specific information about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, generally speaking, common preprocessing steps include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and augmentation. Normalization scales the input features to a range between 0 and 1, while scaling rescales the values to have zero mean and unit variance. Cleaning involves removing noise from the data, such as outliers or missing values. Augmentation generates new samples by applying transformations like rotation, flipping, or zooming. These techniques help improve the accuracy and efficiency of the deep learning models.
