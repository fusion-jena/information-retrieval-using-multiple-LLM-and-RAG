Based on the given context, there is no explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the LSTM model was compared with other models like the BP model and the Markov chain model, which could be considered a form of validation. Additionally, the study mentions setting parameters like the sampling rate, number of decision trees, and parallel processing to improve execution speed, but this doesn't directly address generalizability concerns. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, I cannot definitively state what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
