The research paper does not explicitly mention the method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions utilizing the Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency dataset for training and validation purposes. This suggests that the authors might have collected their raw data from publicly available datasets or through collaborations with relevant agencies such as the Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency. It would be best to refer directly to the original source material for more specific information regarding the data collection process.
