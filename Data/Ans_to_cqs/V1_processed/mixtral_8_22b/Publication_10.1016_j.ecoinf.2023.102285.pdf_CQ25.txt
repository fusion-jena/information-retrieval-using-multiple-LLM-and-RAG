The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, considering the overall theme of the text, which discusses methods for detecting underwater man-made objects (MMOs) and specific types of surface marine MMOs, we can infer that the deep learning model might be used for object detection or classification tasks. This assumption is further supported by the mention of a study by Han et al. (2022), who proposed a deep learning technique called LCSE-ResNet to detect, classify, and locate vessels and oil platforms based on remote optical imagery. Therefore, without explicit information about the specific deep learning model discussed in the context, we can only speculate that its purpose could be related to object detection or classification tasks in the context of underwater or surface marine environments.
