The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training typically include the size of the dataset, the complexity of the model, and the desired level of accuracy. The most common approach is to divide the dataset into three subsets: training set, validation set, and testing set.

The training set is used to train the model by adjusting its parameters based on the input features and corresponding output labels. This subset should be large enough to capture the variability in the data and prevent overfitting.

The validation set is used to evaluate the performance of the model during the training process and tune hyperparameters such as learning rate or regularization strength. It helps to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data.

The testing set is used to assess the final performance of the model after it has been trained and validated. It provides an independent evaluation of how well the model will perform on new data.

The proportion of each subset can vary depending on the specific application and available resources. However, a commonly used ratio is 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing.
