The given context does not provide specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that machine learning and deep learning techniques have been used to develop models for accurate prediction using correlation patterns between input and output datasets. In this case, the input dataset includes weather parameters such as minimum, maximum, and average temperatures, standard meteorological week (SMW)-wise growing degree days (GDD), minimum relative humidity (RHmini.), maximum relative humidity (RHmax.), average relative humidity (RHave.), cumulative rainfall (mm), and whitefly per three leaves. These datasets were collected from weather stations located at four different locations from 2011 to 2019. Therefore, these datasets can be considered as part of the deep learning pipeline used in this study. However, without further information, we cannot confirm if any other datasets were also used in the pipeline.
