The given context does not provide information about specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it mentions the application of deep learning methods for improved NDVI reconstruction and long-term vegetation cover studies. Therefore, we can infer that some form of optimization technique would have been utilized during the training process of these deep learning models, but the exact method remains unspecified within this context.
