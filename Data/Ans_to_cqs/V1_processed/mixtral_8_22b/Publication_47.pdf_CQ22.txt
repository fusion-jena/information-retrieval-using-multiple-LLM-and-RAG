The performance of the deep learning model, IUC-NN, is evaluated using several metrics such as accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. For instance, when considering binary threat levels, the best IUC-NN model achieved a test accuracy of 84.3%, along with a positive predictive value of 88% and a negative predictive value of 79%. This indicates that the model has high precision and reliability in its predictions. Furthermore, the authors also mention performing cross-validation by shifting the validation set five times to quantify the average validation cross-entropy loss and accuracy. However, they do not explicitly state whether other evaluation metrics like F1 score, ROC curve, or confusion matrix were employed.
