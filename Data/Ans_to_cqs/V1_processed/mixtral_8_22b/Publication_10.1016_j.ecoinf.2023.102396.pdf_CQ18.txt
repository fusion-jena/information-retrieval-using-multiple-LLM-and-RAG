Based on the given information, it appears that the query about monitoring the model performance during training cannot be directly answered since the provided context does not discuss any specific models or their respective training strategies. However, common methods used to monitor model performance during training include tracking metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC, etc., depending on the type of problem being solved. Additionally, techniques like cross-validation, early stopping, learning curves, and regularization can also help ensure optimal model performance during training.
