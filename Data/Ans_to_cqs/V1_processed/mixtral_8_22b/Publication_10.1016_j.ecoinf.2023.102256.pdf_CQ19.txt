Based on the given context, it appears that TensorFlow was used to build the deep learning model. In the references section, there is a citation for Abadi et al.'s paper titled "TensorFlow: Large-scale machine learning on heterogeneous systems" from 2015. Additionally, the URL provided in the reference suggests that TensorFlow was retrieved from <https://www.tensorflow.org/>. Therefore, it can be concluded that TensorFlow was likely used to develop the deep learning model described in the text.
