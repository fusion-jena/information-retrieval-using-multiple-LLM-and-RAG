The text does not provide information about the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it mentions that Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are employed as one of the machine learning algorithms. ANNs can include various architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or even Transformers. But based solely on the given context, it cannot be definitively stated which particular architecture is utilized.
