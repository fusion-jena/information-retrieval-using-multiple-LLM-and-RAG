Based on the given context, it appears that the authors have not explicitly mentioned the specific process they followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, some clues can be found regarding the possible deployment steps taken during the experiment.

For instance, the authors mention using a classifier head identical to the one used during the transfer learning training process. This suggests that the authors might have serialized or saved the trained model weights after completing the training phase. They could then load these saved weights when deploying the model for prediction tasks.

Additionally, the authors discuss evaluating the transfer learning models based on classification performance. This implies that the deployed model should include both the embedding model (such as BirdNet-1) and the classifier head. Therefore, the authors may have combined the embedding model and the classifier head into a single deployable model architecture.

However, without explicit information about the platform selection or other details related to the deployment process, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer. It would be necessary to refer to additional sources or contact the authors directly for further clarification.
