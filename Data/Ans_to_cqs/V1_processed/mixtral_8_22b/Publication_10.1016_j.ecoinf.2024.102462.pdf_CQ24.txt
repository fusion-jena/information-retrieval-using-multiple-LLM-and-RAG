The text does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some strategies can be inferred based on common practices in machine learning and deep learning. One strategy mentioned indirectly is using a large and diverse dataset to train the model, which helps mitigate the effects of random initialization and improves the model's ability to generalize across various conditions. Another approach could involve setting specific random seeds before running experiments to ensure reproducibility and consistency in results. Additionally, techniques like cross-validation and ensemble methods can help address variability due to randomness in the training process.
