Unfortunately, there isn't any specific information about postprocessing steps involved after the model training in the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based solely on this context. However, generally speaking, some common postprocessing steps include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., creating confusion matrices, and visualizing results. These steps help evaluate the performance of the trained models and gain insights into their predictions.
