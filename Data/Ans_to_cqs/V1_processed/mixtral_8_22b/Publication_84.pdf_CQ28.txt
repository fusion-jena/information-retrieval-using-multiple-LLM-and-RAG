The article mentions that the Google Earth Engine (GEE) was used to handle a large amount of data required by the pixel-based method (i.e., Ppf-CM). However, it does not explicitly state whether the deep learning model was deployed on this platform or another one such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
