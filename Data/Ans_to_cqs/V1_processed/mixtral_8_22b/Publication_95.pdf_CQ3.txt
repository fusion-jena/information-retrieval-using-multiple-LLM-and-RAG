Based on the provided context, there isn't explicit mention of specific data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, we do see that the study involves annotating images for identifying Individual Aquatic Passive Samplers (IAPS), which suggests some form of object detection or classification annotation technique.

In general, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include:

1. Bounding Box Annotation: This method involves drawing boxes around objects within an image to identify them. It's commonly used for object detection tasks.

2. Semantic Segmentation: In this method, every pixel in an image is assigned a label corresponding to the object it represents. This technique is often employed for scene understanding tasks.

3. Instance Segmentation: Similar to semantic segmentation, but here, each distinct object gets its own unique identifier. This allows for more precise identification of multiple instances of the same type of object.

4. Polygon Annotation: Used primarily for irregularly shaped objects, polygons are drawn around the perimeter of the object to define its boundaries.

5. Line Annotation: This method is typically used for lane detection in autonomous driving applications. Lines are drawn along roads, lanes, etc.

6. Point Annotation: Points are placed at key locations on an object to denote its presence or position.

Without further details about the specific annotation process used in the study, it's not possible to definitively state which of these methods were applied. But based on the nature of the task - identifying IAPS in images - it seems likely that some form of object detection/classification annotation technique was utilized.
