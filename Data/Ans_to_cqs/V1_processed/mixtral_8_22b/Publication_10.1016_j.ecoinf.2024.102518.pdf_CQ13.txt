The text does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model such as learning rate or optimizer. Instead, it discusses the use of Maxent modeling for predicting species distributions. The authors mention using 'L', 'Q', 'LQ', 'LQP' as feature classes and setting the regularization multiplier from 0.5 to 5. They also describe employing the delta in the Akaike minimum information criterion (delta.AICc) as the metric to determine the best tuning parameters. However, these are not directly related to the hyperparameters typically found in deep learning models.
