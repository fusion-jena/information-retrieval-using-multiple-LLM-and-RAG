The text does not explicitly state the specific format of the input data used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the data used is primarily in image format. The text mentions that the images are tiled into 864 x 864 subimages and processed through a version of the YOLO DCNN using pretrained weights from the COCO dataset. Additionally, the discussion revolves around counting objects within the survey images, suggesting that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is indeed image data.
