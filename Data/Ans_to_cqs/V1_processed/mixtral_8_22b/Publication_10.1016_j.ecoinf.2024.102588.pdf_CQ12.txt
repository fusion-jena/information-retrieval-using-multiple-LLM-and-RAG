The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from several mentions throughout the text, such as "Convolutional neural networks (CNN)" and "The CNN model". Additionally, the formula presented for updating the weights of the model is specific to CNNs. Furthermore, the use case mentioned - image recognition and processing tasks - is a common application of CNNs.
