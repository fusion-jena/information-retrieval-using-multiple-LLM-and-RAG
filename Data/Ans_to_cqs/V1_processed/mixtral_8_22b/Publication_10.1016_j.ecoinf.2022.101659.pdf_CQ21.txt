The provided context does not directly address the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, confusion matrices, etc. However, based on general machine learning principles, here are some common postprocessing steps often taken after model training:

1. Model Evaluation: After training a model, evaluating its performance using appropriate evaluation metrics is crucial. These metrics could include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC, etc., depending on the problem type (classification, regression, etc.).

2. Confusion Matrix: In classification tasks, creating a confusion matrix helps visualize the performance of the algorithm. Each row of the matrix represents the instances in an actual class while each column represents the instances in a predicted class.

3. Saliency Maps: For deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks used in image processing tasks, generating saliency maps can help understand what parts of the input images contribute most significantly to the final prediction.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning: Posttraining, hyperparameters can be fine-tuned to further optimize the modelâ€™s performance. Techniques like Grid Search, Randomized Search, Bayesian Optimization, etc., can be employed for this purpose.

5. Ensemble Methods: Combining several base models into one ensemble model can sometimes boost overall performance. Common techniques include bagging, boosting, stacking, etc.

6. Interpretability & Explainability: To better understand how the model makes decisions, various methods can be applied, including LIME, SHAP, Anchors, etc.

Please note that the exact postprocessing steps depend heavily on the nature of the task, the chosen algorithms, and the desired outcomes.
