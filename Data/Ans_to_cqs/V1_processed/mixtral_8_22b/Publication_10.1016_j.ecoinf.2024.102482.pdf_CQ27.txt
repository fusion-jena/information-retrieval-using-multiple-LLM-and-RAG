The text does not provide explicit information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, it mentions that the proposed water quality monitoring system uses the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for analyzing time-series data from the swimming behavior of C. elegans. To ensure real-time predictions and compatibility with devices having limited computing power, the authors designed the model structure to be as simple as possible without compromising performance.

Although the exact method of deployment isn't mentioned, common practices for deploying deep learning models include model serialization and platform selection. Model serialization involves saving the trained model parameters in a file format like.h5 or.pkl, which can then be loaded onto another device for making predictions. Platform selection refers to choosing a suitable environment for running the deployed model, such as cloud services, edge devices, or mobile applications.

In conclusion, while the text doesn't explicitly state the deployment process, it implies that the trained LSTM model could potentially undergo model serialization and be deployed on platforms compatible with devices having limited computing resources.
