The given context does not provide information about which specific cloud platform or service was used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it mentions that TensorRT was used for deployment, which is a platform for high-performance deep learning inference developed by NVIDIA. It optimizes the runtime and memory usage of deep learning models, allowing them to run efficiently on NVIDIA GPUs. Based on this information, we can infer that the deep learning model might have been deployed on a platform that supports NVIDIA GPUs, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instances with GPU support, Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines with GPU capabilities, or Google Cloud Platform Compute Engine instances with GPUs. But without explicit mention of the exact platform, we cannot definitively determine which one was used.
