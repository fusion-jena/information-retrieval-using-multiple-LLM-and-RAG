Based on the given information, it appears that the study uses image datasets from social media platforms such as Dianping, Ctrip, and Weibo. These datasets consist of both textual and visual content related to traditional villages in Fuzhou City, China. The text data is analyzed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Meanwhile, the image data is processed using High-Resolution Net (HRNet) for semantic segmentation and Matlab for image complexity calculation. However, specific details about the exact nature or size of these datasets are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide more precise information regarding their similarities or differences compared to popular benchmark datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
