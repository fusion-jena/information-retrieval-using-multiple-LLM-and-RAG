Based on the provided context, there isn't any explicit mention of techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some techniques mentioned in the text could potentially help mitigate data bias indirectly. For instance, data augmentation techniques such as Random crop, Mosaic, and Color distortions (like brightness, contrast, saturation, hue, Gaussian blur, Random scaling, Random rotation, and Random horizontal flipping) were used during training. These techniques can help create a more diverse dataset and reduce the risk of overfitting, especially when dealing with a small amount of data. While these techniques do not directly address data bias, they can contribute to building a more robust and generalizable model. It's essential to note that addressing data bias often involves strategies beyond preprocessing, such as collecting diverse data, stratified sampling, oversampling, and undersampling. Unfortunately, none of these methods are explicitly discussed in the provided context.
