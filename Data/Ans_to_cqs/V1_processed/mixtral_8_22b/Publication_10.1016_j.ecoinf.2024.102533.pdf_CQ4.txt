The provided context does not contain information about specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, shearing, and translating images. These techniques help increase the size of the training set and improve model performance by introducing variations into the input data.
