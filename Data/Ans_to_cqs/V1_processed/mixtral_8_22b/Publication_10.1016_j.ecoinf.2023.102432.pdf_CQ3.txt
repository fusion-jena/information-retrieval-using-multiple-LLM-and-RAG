The given context does not provide specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, some general insights regarding data handling and processing can be derived from the text.

For instance, Random Forest is mentioned as a common machine learning approach used in remote sensing for classification. This method involves associating a single pixel's spectrum with a single metadata record. On the other hand, MTMI-SMF allows for multiple pixels' spectra to be associated with a single metadata record. The authors also mention using MATLAB's TreeBagger function to perform the classification using 100 trees.

Regarding data preprocessing, the authors state that since training locations often do not fall near the center of a pixel, they select a random pixel from the pixels in closest proximity to the training location for analysis. They then use this single pixel dataset to train their model using 5K-fold cross-validation.

While these details offer insight into how the researchers handled and processed their data, there is no explicit mention of any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, I cannot definitively determine what data annotation techniques were employed in the study.
