Based on the given information, there isn't any explicit mention of how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, such as through methods like grid search or random search. However, it can be inferred that some form of optimization might have been performed due to the discussion around avoiding errors and increasing Kriging accuracy. Additionally, the table shows different models being applied to analyze various lands, suggesting possible experimentation with different parameter settings. Nonetheless, without specific details regarding the optimization process, we cannot definitively state what method was used.
