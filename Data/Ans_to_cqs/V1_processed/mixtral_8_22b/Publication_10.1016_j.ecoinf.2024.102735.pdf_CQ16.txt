The paper does not explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions that the training process is repeated for 1000 iterations, utilizing distinct sample sets each time. Additionally, during the training phase, the training set is further randomly sampled to select training and validation sets to obtain optimized machine learning model hyperparameters. This suggests that the authors may have used validation loss or another performance metric to evaluate the model during training and determine when to stop training. Without explicit information about the stopping criterion, we can only infer that the authors might have used a common practice such as early stopping based on validation loss or performance metrics.
