The dataset used in this deep learning pipeline is not one of the commonly known datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it consists of 35,573 images per channel for 35 different species, resulting in a total of 426,876 images. These images were then divided into three sets for training, validation, and testing in the ratio of 80:10:10 respectively. To improve the robustness and generalization ability of the classifier, data augmentation techniques like flipping horizontally/vertically, adjustments in brightness, saturation, contrast, and hue were applied to the images in the training set. It should also be noted that the authors had previously suggested that a minimum of 200 images per species are needed for accurate identification of phytoplankton. However, in this study, five out of six species with fewer than 200 pollen grains were classified with an accuracy greater than 90%. Therefore, based on these findings, the authors concluded that between 50 and 100 pollen grain images on a single channel would suffice for inclusion in the reference library.
