The text does not explicitly mention which optimization technique is used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does provide information about the learning rate schedule. The initial learning rate was set to 0.001 and was exponentially decayed every 3 epochs with a factor of 0.94. This suggests that some form of gradient descent optimization algorithm was likely used, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or one of its variants like Momentum or Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG). These methods use a learning rate to control the step size during weight updates. The exponential decay of the learning rate over time is also a common strategy used to improve convergence and reduce oscillations when using these optimization algorithms. Without further information, it cannot be definitively stated which specific optimization technique was employed.
