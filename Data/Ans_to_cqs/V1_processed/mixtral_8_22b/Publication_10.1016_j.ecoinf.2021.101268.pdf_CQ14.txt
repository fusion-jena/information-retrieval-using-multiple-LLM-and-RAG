The context does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, one can infer from the context that the authors might have used stochastic optimization methods like Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2014), which is mentioned in the references. It is also possible that they could have employed techniques like grid search or random search, but there is no direct evidence supporting these assumptions. Therefore, without further clarification, we cannot definitively state how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized.
