The text does not explicitly state what type of data format is being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the data format used is images since the paper discusses RGB-based tree identification and retraining the network using hand-annotated data. Additionally, the mention of normalizing the RGB channels further supports the idea that the data format used is images. Therefore, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is likely images.
