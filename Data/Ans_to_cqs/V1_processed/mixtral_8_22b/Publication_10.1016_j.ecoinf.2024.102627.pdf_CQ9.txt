The text does not provide explicit information about where the data repository for the deep learning pipeline is available. However, based on standard practices in scientific research, one might expect such datasets to be made publicly accessible through repositories like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Given that the paper mentions using GBIF data, there is a possibility that the processed data used in their study could also be shared via GBIF. Nevertheless, without specific details mentioned in the given context, we cannot definitively state where the data repository is located.
