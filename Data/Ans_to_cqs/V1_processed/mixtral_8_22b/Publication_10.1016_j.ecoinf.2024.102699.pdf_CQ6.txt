Based on the given context, there isn't explicit mention of specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning prior to training the deep learning models. However, the text does discuss various data augmentation techniques used during training. These include adding Gaussian noise, pink noise, primary and secondary background noise soundscapes, background noise like wind, thunder, or aircraft sounds, mixed up random bird species, horizontal and vertical rolls, pitch shifts, time masks, frequency masks, gain adjustments, loudness normalization, horizontal and vertical flips, time stretching, and tanh-based distortions. While these aren't traditional preprocessing steps, they serve to enhance the dataset and improve the robustness of the trained models. It should be noted that the effectiveness of these augmentation techniques was consistent across all three deep learning models tested - DenseNet-161, ResNet-50, and ViT-B/16.
