To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. One such measure was the use of diverse datasets for training the model. Four different training datasets (T1, T2, T3, and T4) were used, each containing different types of images. For example, T1 included only whole fish images, while T2 included both whole fish and environmental images. T3 added parts of fish images to the mix, and T4 further refined it by adding multiple "part of species" classes instead of a single "part of fish" class. This diversity in the training data helped the model learn better and improved its ability to identify various fish species accurately.

Moreover, the model was also subjected to post-processing techniques to enhance its accuracy. Two decision rules (r1 and r2) were applied to the raw outputs of the model. Rule r1 involved retaining the most probable fish class if the "environment" was identified as the most likely class. On the other hand, rule r2 considered "part of species X" as equivalent to "species X." These rules helped reduce errors and increase the overall identification rate of the model.

Furthermore, the model's performance was evaluated against human experts to assess its reliability. The results showed that the model performed exceptionally well, with an average success rate of 95.7% across all nine species. Only three species had a success rate below 90%, while nine species had a success rate above 95%. Confusions between fish species were minimal, and confusions between fish and the environment were significantly reduced through the application of decision rule r1.

In conclusion, the combination of diverse datasets, post-processing techniques, and evaluation against human experts ensured the generalizability of the deep learning model, making it highly reliable for identifying various fish species.
