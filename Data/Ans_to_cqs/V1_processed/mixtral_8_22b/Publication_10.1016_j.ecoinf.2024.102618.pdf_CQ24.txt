The paper does not explicitly discuss strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some common practices in handling randomness include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility or employing techniques like cross-validation and averaging multiple runs to mitigate the impact of random initialization. These methods help ensure consistent results across experiments and reduce the variability caused by random factors.
