The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using two primary metrics: out-of-bag R^2 and root mean square error (RMSE). Out-of-bag R^2 measures the proportion of variance explained by the model, while RMSE quantifies the average difference between predicted and actual values. These metrics provide insights into how well the model can generalize to unseen data. Additionally, variable importance is determined through the permutation method, ranking variables based on their impact on model performance when randomly shuffled. Partial dependence plots generated using the 'pdp' package further illustrate the influence of individual predictors on the response variable.
