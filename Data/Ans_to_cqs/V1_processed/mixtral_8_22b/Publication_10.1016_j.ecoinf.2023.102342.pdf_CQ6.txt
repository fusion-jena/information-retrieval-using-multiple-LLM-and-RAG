The provided context does not explicitly mention any preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, based on general practices in data mining and machine learning, these preprocessing steps are often necessary to prepare the data for analysis. Normalization involves rescaling numeric features to a common range to prevent differences in scales from influencing the outcome. Scaling adjusts the values of numeric features to have approximately mean zero and variance one, which can improve the performance of some models. Cleaning refers to handling missing or inconsistent data points, outliers, and other issues that may affect the quality of the data. These preprocessing steps are typically carried out after selecting relevant data for the study and before applying data mining techniques like the Apriori algorithm mentioned in the context.
