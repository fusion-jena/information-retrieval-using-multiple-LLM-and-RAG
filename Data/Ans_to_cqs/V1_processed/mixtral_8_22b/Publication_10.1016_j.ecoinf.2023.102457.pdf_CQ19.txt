Unfortunately, the given information does not explicitly mention the specific deep learning framework used to build the BirdNET model. While it mentions that the model was developed using Python version 3.10, it doesn't specify whether popular libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch were utilized. Therefore, without additional details, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the exact framework employed to construct the BirdNET model.
