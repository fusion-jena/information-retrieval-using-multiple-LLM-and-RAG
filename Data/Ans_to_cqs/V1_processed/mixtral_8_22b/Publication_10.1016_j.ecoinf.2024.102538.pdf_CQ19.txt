Unfortunately, there isn't enough context provided to determine which frameworks were used to build the deep learning models mentioned in the text. The authors do not explicitly state whether they used TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other framework to construct their models. Therefore, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer to this query based solely on the given context.
