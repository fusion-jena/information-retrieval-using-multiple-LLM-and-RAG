The performance of the deep learning models was evaluated using three main metrics: positive predictive value, sensitivity, and F1-measure. True positives correspond to images correctly identified as containing whales, false positives are images incorrectly labeled as having whales when they do not, and false negatives are images with whales that go undetected. A high positive predictive value indicates that the model accurately identifies actual whales over false ones, while high sensitivity signifies that the model detects most of the actual whales. The F1-measure offers a balanced compromise between precision and sensitivity. The evaluation process employed a 5-fold cross-validation strategy to assess the two-step approach and the baseline on the test dataset.
