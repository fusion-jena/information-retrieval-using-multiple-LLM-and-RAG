Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about the preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning models. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to perform several preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, cleaning, and augmentation. Normalization involves rescaling the input features so they have zero mean and unit variance. Scaling ensures that all features contribute equally to the final output. Cleaning removes noise from the dataset, while augmentation generates new samples by applying transformations like rotation, flipping, zooming, etc. It should be noted that these preprocessing steps may vary depending on the nature of the problem and the type of data used.
