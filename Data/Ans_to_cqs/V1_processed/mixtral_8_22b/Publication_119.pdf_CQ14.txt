The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using GridSearchCV, a function available in scikit-learn 0.24. For instance, in the case of the DNN model, the learning rate, number of epochs, and batch size were optimized by tuning these hyperparameters until the testing accuracy and kappa were the best among all models. The optimized hyperparameter values for learning rate and batch size were found to be 0.007 and 48, respectively. Similarly, for the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model with Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, the best values for C and Î³ were also optimized using GridSearchCV and were found to be 1000 and 1, respectively. In the case of the Random Forest (RF) model, the number of trees and the maximum number of features to be considered for the best split were tuned via GridSearchCV as well.
