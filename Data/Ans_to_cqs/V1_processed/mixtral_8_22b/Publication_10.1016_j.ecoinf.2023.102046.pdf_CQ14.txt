The authors performed a hyperparameter search for their classification and regression models to find the appropriate level of regularization. They did this by considering various values for the parameters and observing how they affected the accuracy of the models. Specifically, for the linear regression model, they looked at values of alpha (which determines the L2 regularization) ranging from 0.1 to 19.6 with increments of 0.5. They then evaluated the accuracy of the model based on these values and observed that the model showed stable performance for alpha values between 5.0 and 15.0. Similarly, for the classification model, they considered values of C (the regularization parameter) ranging from 0.001 to 1.001 with increments of 0.005. Again, they evaluated the accuracy of the model based on these values and determined that the optimal values for alpha and C were 0.1 and 0.1 respectively. It appears that the authors used a form of grid search or manual search to optimize the hyperparameters of their models. However, the exact method used is not explicitly stated in the given information.
