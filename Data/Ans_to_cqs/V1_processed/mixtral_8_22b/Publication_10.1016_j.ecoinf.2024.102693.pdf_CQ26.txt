The given context does not provide specific details about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, I can share general techniques used to handle data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same class distribution in both sets. This technique ensures that the model learns from a representative sample of the entire dataset.

Oversampling is a technique where the minority class samples are duplicated or synthesized to balance the class distribution. This helps prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class. Undersampling, on the other hand, involves removing samples from the majority class to achieve a balanced class distribution. Both oversampling and undersampling aim to mitigate the impact of imbalanced datasets on model performance.

Diverse data collection refers to collecting data from various sources, demographics, or environments to ensure that the dataset represents real-world scenarios accurately. This technique reduces the risk of overfitting and improves the model's ability to generalize to new data.

In summary, these techniques help address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline by ensuring that the dataset is representative, balanced, and diverse.
