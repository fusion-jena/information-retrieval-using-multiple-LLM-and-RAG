The provided context does not explicitly mention the method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of camera traps, which can be considered a type of sensor used for gathering data on wildlife presence or absence. In this case, the researchers seem to have employed camera traps to collect data on felids, but no further details about the specifics of the data collection process are given.

The authors discuss two approaches for modeling species distributions using machine learning techniques such as Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) and Random Forests (RFs). They describe a bootstrapped RF approach where they subsample their camera trap dataset by randomly selecting 20% of both presence and absence locations. This subset is then used to train the RF model, and the process is repeated 100 times with replacement to produce multiple probability surfaces. These surfaces are then averaged to obtain the final species distribution probability surface.

While the context does not provide explicit information regarding the use of surveys or public datasets, it does highlight the importance of utilizing multi-scale environmental variables in species distribution modeling. The study focuses on six elevation levels ranging from 1000m to 10,000m, suggesting that the collected data may include various ecological factors relevant to these altitudes.
