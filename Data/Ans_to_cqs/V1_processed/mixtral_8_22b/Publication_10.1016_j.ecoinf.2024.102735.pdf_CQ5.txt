The information provided does not explicitly mention any specific datasets used in the deep learning pipelines. However, it can be inferred from the context that various water quality datasets were utilized for building machine learning models like Random Forest, Multilayer Perceptron, Long Short Term Memory, and Support Vector Regression. These datasets included variables such as chlorophyll-a, phycocyanin, algal cells, and toxins. Additionally, some studies mentioned using high-frequency datasets and manually sampled datasets. Unfortunately, no further details about these datasets or their sources are given in the provided references.
