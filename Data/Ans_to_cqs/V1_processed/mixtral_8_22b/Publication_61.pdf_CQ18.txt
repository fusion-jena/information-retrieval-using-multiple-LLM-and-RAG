The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves tracking the training loss and training accuracy. Figures 8 and 9 display the training loss and training accuracy graphs, respectively. Additionally, the validation accuracy is monitored, as depicted in Figure 10. These metrics help evaluate the model's progress and ensure its effectiveness throughout the training process.
