The text does not provide information about the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models. However, it mentions using transfer learning, which is commonly done using popular deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. Therefore, it is likely that one of these frameworks was used, but without explicit mention, this cannot be confirmed.
