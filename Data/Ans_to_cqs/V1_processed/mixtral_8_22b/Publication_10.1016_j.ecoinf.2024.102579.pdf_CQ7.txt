The provided context does not contain any specific information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, generally speaking, common practices include splitting the dataset into three parts: training set, validation set, and testing set. The training set is used to fit the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final performance of the model. The proportion of each set varies depending on the size of the dataset and the problem being solved. Common splits are 60/20/20%, 70/15/15%, or 80/10/10%. It is also possible to use techniques such as k-fold cross-validation or leave-one-out cross-validation to further improve the robustness of the model evaluation.
