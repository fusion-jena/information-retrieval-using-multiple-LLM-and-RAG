The text does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, it provides some information about parameter estimation for the latent space dimensionality. In this case, the high-dimensionality of the latent space representations was reduced using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP). The estimation of the local density of the data was used as a regularizer in the optimization of the low-dimensional representation using DensMAP. The parameter estimation of the latent space dimensionality (n\_components) was determined according to the internal validation of the clustering quality and performance. Clustering validation was performed on multiple combinations, with latent space dimensionality ranging in {5, 10, 15, 20, 25}. All other UMAP parameters were set to default values. Therefore, while there is no explicit mention of hyperparameter optimization methods like grid search or random search, the process described can be considered a form of manual tuning or searching within a predefined range of values for the latent space dimensionality.
