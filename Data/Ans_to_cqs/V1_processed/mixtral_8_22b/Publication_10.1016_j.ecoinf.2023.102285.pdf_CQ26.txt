To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes or labels in both sets. This ensures that the model is trained and evaluated on representative samples of each class.

Oversampling is a technique used when there is a significant imbalance between classes in the dataset. It involves duplicating examples from the minority class until its size matches that of the majority class. Alternatively, synthetic examples can be generated using methods such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Overpopulation Technique).

Undersampling, on the other hand, reduces the number of examples in the majority class to match the size of the minority class. This can be done randomly or through more sophisticated methods like Tomek links or NearMiss.

Finally, collecting diverse data helps ensure that the model generalizes well across different populations and scenarios. This can involve gathering data from multiple sources, capturing variations within each class, and accounting for any biases present in the original dataset.

Based on the given context, it appears that the authors have utilized some form of stratified sampling during their experiments, as they mention evaluating their model with a completely new dataset independent from the first and second datasets. However, specific details about how they addressed data bias during preprocessing are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.
