The article does not provide explicit information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, it mentions that Google Earth Engine (GEE) was used as a platform for handling massive amounts of data required by the pixel-based method (i.e., Ppf-CM) due to its powerful data storage and high computational capacity. This suggests that the trained deep learning model might have been deployed using GEE, but the specific details regarding model serialization or other aspects of the deployment process are not mentioned in the given context.
