The article does not provide explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the keywords and references mentioned, it can be inferred that the study might have involved image processing techniques applied to remote sensing data obtained from sources such as Google Earth Engine or Sentinel-1 SAR time series. These platforms often collect data using various types of sensors mounted on satellites or aircraft. Additionally, some studies may use publicly available datasets like ImageNet or COCO for training their models. Nevertheless, without more detailed information, it is impossible to definitively state which methods were employed for gathering raw data in this particular research.
