The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves holding out 50% of the training data for validation purposes. This means that while the model is being trained on one portion of the data, its performance is continuously evaluated against another portion of the data that it hasn't seen before. This process helps ensure that the model doesn't overfit to the training data and can generalize well to unseen data. Additionally, a 10-fold cross-validation was used to define the score-to-posterior-probability transformation function, providing a way to estimate the posterior probability for new observations.
