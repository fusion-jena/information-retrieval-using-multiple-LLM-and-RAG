The given context does not provide information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it mentions the use of machine learning for species identification (Jennings et al., 2008; Parsons and Jones, 2000; Zamora-Gutierrez et al., 2016) and the need for automation when dealing with multi-genera problems involving multiple predictive features (Russo and Jones, 2002). It also discusses the importance of allowing users to interact with algorithms through informative priors determined by local conditions, which may involve some form of data labeling or annotation. Nevertheless, without further details, it is impossible to determine the exact data annotation techniques employed in these studies.
