The text does not explicitly state the purpose of the deep learning model used in the study. However, it mentions that the model was employed to predict suitable habitats for three ungulate species (wild goat, urial, and Jebeer gazelle) using environmental variables such as land cover, topography, climate, and anthropogenic factors. Therefore, we can infer that the deep learning model was likely used for habitat suitability modeling or classification purposes.
