The sources provided do not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in their respective deep learning models. However, they discuss various aspects related to deep learning and its application in bioacoustic classification. For instance, Bianco et al. (2019), Mutanu et al. (2022), and Stowell (2022) highlight the potential of machine learning, particularly deep neural networks, for bioacoustic classification. Frainer et al. (2023), Frasier et al. (2017), Li et al. (2020a), Roman Ruiz et al. (2023), and Zhong et al. (2020) focus on applying these techniques to classify marine mammals. The authors also acknowledge the need for substantial training samples and suggest methods to address this issue, such as enhancing data or combining disparate datasets (Dufourq et al., 2022; Nanni et al., 2020; Nolasco et al., 2023; Padovese et al., 2023; Shorten and Khoshgoftaar, 2019). Despite discussing these topics, none of the sources provide explicit information about the hyperparameters used in their deep learning models.
