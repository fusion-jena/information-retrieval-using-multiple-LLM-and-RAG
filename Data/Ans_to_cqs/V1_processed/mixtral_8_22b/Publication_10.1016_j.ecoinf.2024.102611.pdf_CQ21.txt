After the model training, there are several postprocessing steps that can be performed depending on the requirements of the project. Some common postprocessing steps include calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., to evaluate the performance of the model. Another important step is creating confusion matrices which provide a more detailed analysis of the model's performance by showing the true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. Additionally, saliency maps can also be generated to understand how the model arrived at its decisions by highlighting the most relevant features or pixels in the input images. Other possible postprocessing steps could involve fine-tuning the model's hyperparameters, applying regularization techniques, or even retraining the model with different architectures or parameters. However, it should be noted that not all these steps may be necessary or applicable for every project, and the choice of postprocessing steps would depend on the specific goals and constraints of the project.

I do not have enough information to determine what postprocessing steps were taken after the model training.
