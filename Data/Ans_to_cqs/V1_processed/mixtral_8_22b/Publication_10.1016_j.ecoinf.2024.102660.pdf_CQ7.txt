The study uses a total of 1764 image pairs for their deep learning model. Out of these, 1232 image pairs are used for training the deep neural network, 176 image pairs for validating the model accuracy during the training phase, and 356 image pairs for testing the performance of the trained network after training. Therefore, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are based on the purpose of each set - training, validation, or testing.
