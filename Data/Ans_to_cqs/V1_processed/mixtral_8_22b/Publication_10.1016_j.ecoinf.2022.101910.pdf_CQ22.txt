The performance of the deep learning model, specifically BirdNET, is evaluated using two main metrics: the recall rate and the percentage of occurrences detected. The recall rate is a measure of how many true positive predictions were made out of all actual positive instances. In other words, it measures the proportion of correctly identified bird vocalizations among all actual bird vocalizations present in the data. This metric is also known as sensitivity or true positive rate. The percentage of occurrences detected refers to the number of times the model successfully identifies a specific bird species or vocalization in comparison to the total number of instances where that particular species or vocalization occurs in the validation dataset. These evaluation methods are widely used in bioacoustic studies, including recent works like those conducted by Cole et al. (2022) and Tolkova et al. (2021).
