The given context does not provide any specific links to the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that their workflow implements a FAIR approach and is open source, suggesting that they might have made their code and possibly some datasets publicly accessible. They also mention integrating their workflow with the DataMiner Cloud computing platform of the D4Science e-Infrastructure. Unfortunately, without more specific details about the dataset used in the deep learning pipeline, I cannot provide a direct link to the data repository.
