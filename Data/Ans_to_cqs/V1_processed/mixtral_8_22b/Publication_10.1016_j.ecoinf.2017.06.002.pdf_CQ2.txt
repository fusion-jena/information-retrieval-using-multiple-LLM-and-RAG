The given context does not provide information about a specific deep learning pipeline or the data formats used within such a pipeline. However, it discusses several standards and formats for describing data collection, processing, and reporting for environmental data, which could potentially be used in various pipelines, including deep learning ones. These standards and formats include the Open Geospatial Consortium "Observation and Measurements" standard, International Standards Organization/Federal Geographic Data Committee standards for geospatial and temporal metadata, netCDF formats for climate and forecast metadata, and the Ecological Metadata Language. While these do not directly mention specific data formats like images, audio, video, or CSV, they suggest that the data being handled might involve spatial, temporal, and ecological aspects. Therefore, depending on the application, any suitable format representing such data could be employed in a deep learning pipeline.
