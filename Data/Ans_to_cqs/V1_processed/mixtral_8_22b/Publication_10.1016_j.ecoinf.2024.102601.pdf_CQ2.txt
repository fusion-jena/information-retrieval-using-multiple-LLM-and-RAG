The text does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery, which suggests that the data format used is likely images or raster data. Additionally, the study aims to select the 12 most relevant predictors from S2 imagery, indicating that the input data might be multispectral or hyperspectral images containing various bands of information.

While the text does not provide explicit details about other possible data formats such as audio, video, or CSV files, it emphasizes the focus on optimizing data structures for machine learning classification tasks using S2 imagery. Therefore, it can be inferred that the main data format used in the deep learning pipeline is primarily related to image processing and analysis.
