The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is recursive validation of the Burned Area (BA) classification algorithm over independent wildfires. This approach helps improve computational efficiency without compromising the precision of the BA estimates. The Random Forest (RF) method used in this study does not assume a specific distribution of the response variable and is largely computationally efficient in Google Earth Engine (GEE). The default RF hyperparameters in the GEE implementation were preserved, except for the number of trees, which was set to 500. The mean decrease in the Gini Index (dGI) was also calculated to assess RF variable importance on classification accuracy.
