Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about specific data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does mention manual image labeling, which could imply some form of object detection or classification annotation. In this case, the authors discuss how manually labeling millions of images requires significant resources, including thousands of people working over many years. This suggests that the dataset may contain labeled objects within each image, but the exact technique remains unspecified. Therefore, while I cannot provide a definitive list of data annotation techniques used in this study, it appears that manual image labeling has been employed for creating the dataset.
