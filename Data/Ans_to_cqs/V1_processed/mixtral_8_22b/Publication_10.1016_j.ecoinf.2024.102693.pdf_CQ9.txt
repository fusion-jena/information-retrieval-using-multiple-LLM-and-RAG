Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no explicit mention or reference to where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The context only discusses various aspects of the deep learning pipeline such as Yuan et al.'s claim about the superior performance of Vision Transformers (ViT), the introduction of Volo with Outlook Attention, the comparison between MLP-like and Transformer-like models, and some general transfer training hyperparameters for specific models. However, it does not provide any details regarding the availability of the data repository used in these pipelines. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to the query.
