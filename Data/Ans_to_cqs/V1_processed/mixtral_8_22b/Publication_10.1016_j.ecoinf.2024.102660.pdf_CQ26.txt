Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it can be inferred that some form of data balancing might have been employed due to the distribution of the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets. Specifically, out of the total 1764 image pairs obtained after preprocessing, 1232 image pairs were used for training the deep neural network, 176 image pairs for validating the model accuracy during the training phase, and 356 image pairs for testing the performance of the trained network post-training. This suggests that the authors may have considered addressing potential class imbalance issues while partitioning their dataset. Nevertheless, without further information regarding the exact nature of the dataset and the problem being addressed, it cannot be definitively stated which specific technique was utilized to handle data bias.
