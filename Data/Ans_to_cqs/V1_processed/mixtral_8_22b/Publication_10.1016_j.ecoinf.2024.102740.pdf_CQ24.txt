The sources provided do not directly address the handling of randomness in the deep learning pipeline or the use of random seed values. However, some general strategies can be applied to manage randomness in machine learning models, including deep learning pipelines. These include setting a fixed random seed value before training the model to ensure reproducibility, using cross-validation to evaluate model performance, employing ensemble methods such as bagging or boosting to reduce variance, and applying regularization techniques like dropout or weight decay to prevent overfitting. Additionally, hyperparameter tuning, as discussed in Probst et al. (2019), can help optimize model performance and mitigate the effects of randomness.
