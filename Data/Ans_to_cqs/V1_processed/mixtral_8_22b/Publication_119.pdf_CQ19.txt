The text mentions two different implementations of the U-Net model, one using Keras and another using the arcgis.learn module of the ArcGIS API for Python. However, there is no explicit mention of which specific deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch are being used under the hood. That said, since Keras is a high-level neural networks API that runs on top of TensorFlow, we can infer that TensorFlow is likely being utilized when implementing the U-Net model with Keras. On the other hand, the use of any particular underlying framework for the implementation of the U-Net model within the arcgis.learn module isn't explicitly stated.
