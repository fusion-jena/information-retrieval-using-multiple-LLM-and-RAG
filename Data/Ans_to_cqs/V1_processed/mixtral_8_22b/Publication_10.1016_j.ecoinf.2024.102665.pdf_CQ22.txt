Based on the given context, it appears that the Contingency Table Fit (CTF) is used as a metric to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. This metric represents the quality of the fit to the data and provides a normalized measure from 0 to 100%. A score of 0% indicates the poorest fit, equivalent to the data representation skill of an unconnected network, while a score of 100% indicates the best possible fit, equivalent to the joint probability representation of the data of a completely connected network. It should be noted that this information is based solely on the provided context and may not encompass all potential evaluation metrics for deep learning models.
