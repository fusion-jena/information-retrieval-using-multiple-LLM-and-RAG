After training the deep learning model, the authors deployed it using the Caﬀe framework (Jia et al., 2014). They focused on evaluating the impact of the training data rather than changing the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. Therefore, they used the same CNN architecture for both their training and testing procedures. Unfortunately, the paper does not provide specific information about the exact deployment process such as model serialization or platform selection. However, based on the available information, one can infer that the model was integrated into the Caﬀe framework for further use and evaluation.
