After the model training, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the task. In this case, the authors use the accuracy on the test set as an indicator to evaluate the performance of their classification models. This means that they calculate the percentage of correct predictions made by the model out of the total number of instances in the test set. Additionally, they may also compute metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score to gain further insights into the model's performance. Another common postprocessing step is generating saliency maps, which highlight the regions of the input image that contribute most significantly to the model's prediction. These maps can help identify any biases or errors in the model's decision-making process. Finally, confusion matrices can also be constructed to visualize the distribution of predicted labels versus actual labels, providing a more detailed view of the model's strengths and weaknesses.
