The given context does not provide information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, common techniques include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same proportions of classes within each set. Oversampling increases the size of minority class samples, while undersampling decreases the size of majority class samples. Diverse data collection aims to gather data from different sources and perspectives to reduce bias and improve model accuracy.

These techniques help mitigate data bias and ensure that the model performs well across different subsets of the population. It is important to note that these techniques should be applied carefully, as they may introduce new biases if not implemented correctly.
