Unfortunately, based on the given information, there is no mention of a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the research. The only mentioned dataset is the NDVI data generated from AVHRR sensors by the Global Inventory Monitoring and Modeling Studies (GIMMS), but no direct link or reference to its source was provided. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested data repository link for the deep learning pipeline.
