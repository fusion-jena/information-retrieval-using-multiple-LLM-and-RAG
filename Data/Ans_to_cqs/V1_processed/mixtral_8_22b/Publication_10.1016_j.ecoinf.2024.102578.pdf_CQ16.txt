Based on the given information, there isn't enough detail about the specific machine learning process used to train the models to provide a definitive answer regarding the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, common criteria used to determine when training is complete include reaching a certain number of epochs, achieving a desired level of accuracy or other performance metric, or observing a plateau in the validation loss. In this case, since the table shows performance metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F1 score, it can be assumed that these metrics might have been used to evaluate the model during training and potentially determine when training should stop. But without more detailed information about the training process, it cannot be confirmed which specific criterion was used to determine when training was complete.
