The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the provided context is for the classification of bird species based on their calls. This is achieved through the use of hybrid CNN-LSTM architectures, which combine the temporal modeling abilities of LSTM networks with the feature extraction capabilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Additionally, the Wav2Vec model is employed to extract features from raw audio signals of various bird species, resulting in a 768-dimensional vector. These vectors serve as inputs to a series of dense layers with ReLU activation functions, followed by a classification layer with a sigmoid activation function. Ultimately, the goal of this deep learning model is to accurately categorize different bird species based on their unique vocalizations.
