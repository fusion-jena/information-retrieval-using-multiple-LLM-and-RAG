Based on the given context, there isn't enough information to determine the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, we do see some strategies related to controlling the complexity and accuracy of the queries involved in generating redescriptions. These include setting thresholds on the size of the support of the output redescriptions, requiring a certain percentage of localities to satisfy both queries, and enforcing a minimum accuracy gain when extending candidate queries. While these strategies help ensure the quality of the redescriptions, they do not directly address monitoring the model performance during training. Therefore, based on the provided context, the exact strategy for monitoring the model performance during training remains unknown.
