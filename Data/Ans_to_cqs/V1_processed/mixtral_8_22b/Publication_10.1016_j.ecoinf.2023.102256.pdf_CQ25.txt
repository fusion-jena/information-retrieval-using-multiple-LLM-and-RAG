The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is classification. Specifically, it is designed to classify bird species based on spectrogram inputs. The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, which includes two convolutional layers, max pooling, a flattening operation, and two fully connected layers. The output of the model is a probability for each of the 22 bird species under consideration. Additionally, the text mentions exploring different methods to enhance the neural network with contextual information, suggesting that the goal is to improve the accuracy of the classification model.
