The context does not provide specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions several techniques such as Fusion, IBLA, U-Transformer, Funie-GAN, Water-Net, UWCNN, and Ours, which could potentially involve various ways of gathering raw data like surveys, sensors, or utilizing public datasets. For instance, Fusion might use image fusion techniques combining different sensor inputs, while others may rely on publicly available underwater image datasets. Without explicit mention, we cannot definitively state the exact methods employed for each technique.

Based on the context, it appears that the focus is more on comparing the performance of these methods rather than discussing how they collect raw data. Therefore, further research would be required to determine the specific data collection methods used in each case.
