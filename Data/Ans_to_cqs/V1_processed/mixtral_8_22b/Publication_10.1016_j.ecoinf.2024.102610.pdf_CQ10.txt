Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no information about the code repository link of any deep learning pipeline. The context only provides references to academic papers and software packages used for machine learning and deep learning approaches, such as 'caret', 'VSURF', and 'pdp'. However, it does not provide any specific links to a deep learning pipeline or its corresponding code repository. Therefore, without additional context, it is impossible to determine the requested code repository link.
