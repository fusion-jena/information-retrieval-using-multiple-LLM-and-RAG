The given context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the data format used is likely images or image patches. This is because the context discusses the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are primarily used for image analysis tasks such as image classification. Furthermore, the context mentions the use of data augmentation techniques like rotation, mirroring, and flipping, which are commonly applied to image datasets. Therefore, it can be concluded that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is most likely images or image patches.
