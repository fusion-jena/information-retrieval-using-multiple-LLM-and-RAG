Based on the given context, it appears that the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete are not explicitly mentioned. However, common practices in Machine Learning (ML) include monitoring metrics such as validation loss or accuracy over epochs and stopping the training process once these metrics reach a plateau or no longer improve significantly. This practice helps prevent overfitting and ensures the model generalizes well to unseen data. Additionally, techniques like early stopping can be employed to halt training if the validation error does not decrease after a certain number of iterations. It should be noted that the optimal point to stop training depends on factors such as the complexity of the dataset, the chosen algorithm, and the desired balance between bias and variance.
