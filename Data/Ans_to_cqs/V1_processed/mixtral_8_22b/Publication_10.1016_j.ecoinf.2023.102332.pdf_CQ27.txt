The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific process used to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it discusses various aspects related to natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including text mining packages like 'tm', word embedding techniques such as BERT and Word2Vec, and their applications in tasks like identifying wildlife observations on Twitter and supporting cultural ecosystem service assessments. The context also mentions the use of pre-trained models, such as the baroni word2vec model, instead of training a new custom word2vec model due to the need for a large dataset and increased computational effort. Nevertheless, without explicit information about the deployment process, one cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
