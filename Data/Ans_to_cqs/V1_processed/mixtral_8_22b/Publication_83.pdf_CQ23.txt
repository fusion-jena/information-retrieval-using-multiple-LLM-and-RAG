From the given context, it appears that the authors have focused on improving the classification performance by employing various techniques such as using different time-frequency representations (TFRs), fusing multiple deep learning models, and utilizing a different deep learning architecture called SubSpectralNet. However, there is no explicit mention of specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model.

Generalizability refers to how well a machine learning or deep learning model performs when applied to new, unseen data. To ensure good generalization, one might use diverse datasets, perform cross-validation, or apply stratified splitting during training and testing phases. These techniques help prevent overfitting and allow the model to better handle novel inputs.

In this case, while the authors do discuss using different types of spectrograms as input features and combining several models to enhance performance, they do not explicitly state any particular steps taken to guarantee the robustness and applicability of their approach across varied scenarios. Therefore, without additional information, it remains uncertain whether these aspects were considered during the development and evaluation of their deep learning model.
