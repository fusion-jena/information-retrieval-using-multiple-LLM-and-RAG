The text does not provide explicit information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning models. However, there are some clues regarding the platforms used for training and testing the models. For instance, the authors mention using Microsoft Azure's Data Science Virtual Machine and NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPUs for model training and testing. Additionally, they discuss using low resource computational devices such as CPUs for training models like ResNet152V2. These details suggest that the authors might have considered platform selection based on their specific requirements, such as computational power or budget constraints. Nevertheless, without further information, it is impossible to determine the exact process followed to deploy the trained deep learning models.
