The given context does not provide any specific details regarding the use of deep learning or its hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer. Instead, it discusses the application of Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm for grassland mapping using remote sensing data. The hyperparameters mentioned in the context include maximum depth of trees, minimum number of samples required to split an internal node, and minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node. These parameters are specific to decision tree algorithms like Random Forest and do not apply to deep learning models. Therefore, without additional context, we cannot determine the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model.
