The given context does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it mentions the application of an active learning approach to improve the CNN model iteratively. This suggests that the researchers might have used some form of cross-validation or bootstrapping techniques to ensure robustness against randomness. Additionally, they utilized a grid search technique to fine-tune hyperparameters like the number of epochs, batch size, and learning rate. Grid search involves systematically trying different combinations of parameters and selecting the one that performs best based on a chosen performance metric. While this doesn't directly address randomness from sources like random seed values, it can help mitigate their impact by finding optimal parameter configurations.
