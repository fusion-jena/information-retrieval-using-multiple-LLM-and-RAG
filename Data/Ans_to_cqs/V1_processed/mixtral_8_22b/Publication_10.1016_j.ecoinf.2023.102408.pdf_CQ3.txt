Unfortunately, the given context does not provide any specific details about the use of data annotation techniques in the deep learning pipeline. However, I can still explain some common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. These include:

1. Bounding Box Annotation: This technique involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects within images to identify their location. Each object is assigned a unique label, allowing models to learn what each object looks like and where it typically appears.

2. Semantic Segmentation: In semantic segmentation, every pixel in an image is labeled according to the class it belongs to. For example, all pixels belonging to cars would be labeled as 'car', while those belonging to roads would be labeled as 'road'. This allows models to understand the overall layout of scenes and recognize individual objects more accurately.

3. Instance Segmentation: Similar to semantic segmentation, instance segmentation assigns labels to each pixel in an image. However, instead of grouping all instances of a particular class together, instance segmentation differentiates between individual instances of the same class. This enables models to distinguish between multiple objects of the same type within a scene.

4. Polygon Annotation: This technique involves manually tracing polygons around objects within images to create precise masks. While more time-consuming than bounding box annotation, polygon annotation produces highly detailed representations of objects, making it useful for applications requiring high levels of precision.

5. Landmark Annotation: Also known as keypoint annotation, landmark annotation involves marking specific points on objects within images. Commonly used for facial recognition tasks, landmark annotation helps models locate key features of interest, enabling them to better understand the structure of objects.
