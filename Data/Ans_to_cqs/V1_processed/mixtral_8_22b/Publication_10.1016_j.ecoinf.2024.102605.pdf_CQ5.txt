The given context does not provide information about any specific dataset used in a deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it provides references to various research papers related to ecological informatics, remote sensing, and machine learning applications in agriculture and forestry. Therefore, I cannot determine which datasets were used in these studies without further information.
