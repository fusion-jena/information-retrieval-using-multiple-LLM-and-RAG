The given context does not provide information on specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, some commonly used techniques include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes or labels in both sets. This helps prevent any class imbalance from affecting model performance.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to balance datasets with unequal distributions of classes. Oversampling involves duplicating examples from the minority class, while undersampling removes examples from the majority class. These methods can help improve model performance by reducing the impact of class imbalances.

Diverse data collection involves collecting data from various sources and perspectives to ensure that the dataset accurately represents the population being studied. This technique can help reduce bias introduced by using only one source of data or perspective.

Other techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling Approach), and random under-sampling boosting can also be used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
