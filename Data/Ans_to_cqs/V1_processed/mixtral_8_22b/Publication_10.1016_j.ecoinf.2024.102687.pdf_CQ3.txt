The text does not provide explicit information about the use of specific data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it mentions that ecoacoustic studies have introduced interactive visualization techniques and a data-centric function that automatically segments bird sounds in soundscape recordings to improve the quality of the recording dataset. These methods could be considered as forms of data annotation, where the goal is to create high-quality training datasets with minimal expert annotation effort. Additionally, the text discusses the use of pre-trained models for feature extraction, which can also be seen as a form of semi-supervised learning or transfer learning, where knowledge gained from one task is applied to another related task. Overall, while the text does not explicitly mention bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, it does touch upon various data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for ecological research.
