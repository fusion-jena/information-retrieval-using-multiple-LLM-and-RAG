The given context does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some strategies commonly employed to manage randomness include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using deterministic algorithms where possible, and employing techniques like cross-validation and ensembling to mitigate the impact of random initializations.

In this context, the authors mention using data augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, and brightness adjustments to improve network generalization. These techniques introduce variability into the training data, which can help the model perform well even when faced with new, unseen data. Additionally, the authors fine-tune their model on the specific dataset after pretraining it on ImageNet, which helps adapt the model to the unique characteristics of the target dataset.

While these strategies do not directly address managing randomness due to factors like random seed values, they contribute to building robust and reliable deep learning pipelines. To specifically tackle randomness related to seed values, one could set a fixed seed before running experiments to ensure consistent and reproducible results across multiple runs.
