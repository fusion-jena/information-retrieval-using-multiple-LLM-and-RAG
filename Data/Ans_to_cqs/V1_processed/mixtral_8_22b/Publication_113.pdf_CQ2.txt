The provided context does not explicitly mention the data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, there are some indications that suggest the use of image data. Specifically, the text mentions using a pre-trained detector model on images, which implies that the input data is likely in image format. Additionally, the reference to eMammal Machine Trap Images further supports the idea that the pipeline uses image data. Therefore, based on the given context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily utilizes image data.
