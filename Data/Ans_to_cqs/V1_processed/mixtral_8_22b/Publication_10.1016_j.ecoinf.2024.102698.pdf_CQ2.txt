Based on the given context, it cannot be determined what specific data formats were used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that convolutional neural networks (CNN) were utilized, which are commonly used for processing grid-like topology data such as images or videos. Additionally, the use of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) suggests that the input data could have been in various forms including images, text, or other structured data. Unfortunately, there is no explicit mention of the exact data format used in the deep learning pipeline within the provided context.
