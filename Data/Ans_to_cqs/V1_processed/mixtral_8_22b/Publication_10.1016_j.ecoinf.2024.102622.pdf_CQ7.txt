Based on the given context, it appears that the dataset was divided into two parts: a training set and a validation set. However, there is no explicit mention of how the data was split or what specific criteria were used to divide the data. Typically, when using supervised learning algorithms such as Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree Classifier, Multilayer Perceptron, and Extreme Gradient Boosting, the dataset is often randomly shuffled and then split into three sets: training, testing, and validation. The training set is used to fit the model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance after each epoch. Finally, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. It seems that in this case, only a training set and a validation set were mentioned, without any reference to a testing set. Nonetheless, the division of datasets into these subsets is crucial for evaluating the generalization ability of the model and preventing overfitting.
