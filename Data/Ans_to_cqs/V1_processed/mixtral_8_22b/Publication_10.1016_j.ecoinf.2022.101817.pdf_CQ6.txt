The authors do not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps taken before training their deep learning models for environmental condition classification. However, they do discuss some post-processing steps such as image filtering and enhancement after the completion of the environmental classification phase. It can be assumed that standard preprocessing techniques like data augmentation, normalization, or scaling might have been employed but these details are not mentioned in the given text.

Based on common practices in machine learning and deep learning, it is likely that the input images were resized to fit the required dimensions of the convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. Additionally, normalizing the pixel values between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1 could help improve convergence during training. Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, zooming, or cropping may also have been utilized to increase the size of the training set and prevent overfitting.

However, without explicit information regarding the preprocessing steps taken by J. Soom et al., one cannot provide a definitive list of preprocessing methods used before training their deep learning models.
