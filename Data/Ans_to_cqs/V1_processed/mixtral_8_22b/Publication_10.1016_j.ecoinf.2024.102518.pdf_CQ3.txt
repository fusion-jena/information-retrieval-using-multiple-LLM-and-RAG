The given context does not provide any direct information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge, some common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include:

1. Bounding Box Annotation: This technique involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects within images or videos to identify their location. It is commonly used for object detection tasks.

2. Instance Segmentation: This technique involves identifying individual instances of objects within an image by creating pixel-wise masks. It provides more detailed information compared to bounding box annotation.

3. Semantic Segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image with its corresponding class. It is useful for understanding the overall scene rather than focusing on specific objects.

4. Polygon Annotation: This technique involves drawing polygonal shapes around objects within images to accurately define their boundaries. It is often used when precise outlines are required.

5. Key Point Annotation: This technique involves marking specific points on objects within images, such as joints on human bodies. It is commonly used for pose estimation tasks.
