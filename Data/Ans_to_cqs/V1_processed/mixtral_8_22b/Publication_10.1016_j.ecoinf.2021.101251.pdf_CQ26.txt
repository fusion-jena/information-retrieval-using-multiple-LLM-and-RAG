The provided context does not explicitly discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some general principles related to handling data bias can still be inferred.

Data bias can occur due to various reasons like imbalanced classes, skewed distributions, or non-representative samples. To mitigate these biases, several strategies can be employed.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the class proportions. This ensures that each subset represents the overall distribution of the original dataset.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to balance datasets with unequal class representation. Oversampling duplicates instances from the minority class, whereas undersampling removes instances from the majority class. Alternatively, synthetic sampling methods like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) can generate new examples by interpolating between existing ones.

Diverse data collection aims to gather a wide range of representative samples to reduce potential biases introduced by limited sources. By incorporating diverse perspectives, demographics, or conditions, models trained on such data may exhibit improved performance and fairness.

In summary, although the given context doesn't specifically mention techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, common approaches include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. These methods help ensure balanced representations, maintain class proportions, and capture varied aspects of the problem domain.
