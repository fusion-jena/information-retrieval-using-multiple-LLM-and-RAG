To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were implemented. Firstly, a diverse dataset was utilized, consisting of 40-dimensional data spanning over a large time period and covering a vast land area. This diversity helped capture various patterns and trends within the data, enabling the model to learn from multiple scenarios and improving its adaptability to new situations.

Secondly, the authors employed a 10-fold cross-validation method to divide the training and validation set into ten parts. Nine of these parts served as the training set, while the remaining part acted as the validation set. By rotating through all possible combinations of training and validation sets, the model could be trained and evaluated on different portions of the data, further enhancing its robustness and reducing the risk of overfitting.

Lastly, stratified splitting was applied when dealing with the issue of class imbalance in the categorical data. With a ratio of 7:14:1:5:7 among the five types of Land Use (LU) suitability samples in the training data, the authors assigned larger weights to categories with fewer samples and smaller weights to those with more samples. This approach ensured that the model did not favor any particular category due to their respective sample sizes, thereby promoting fair representation across all classes and contributing to the overall generalizability of the deep learning model.
