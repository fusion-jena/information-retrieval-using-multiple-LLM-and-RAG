Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of the specific deep learning framework used to build the described models such as YOLOv8, CSMBDarknet, or any other mentioned models. Therefore, it would be impossible to determine whether they were built using TensorFlow, PyTorch, or another framework.
