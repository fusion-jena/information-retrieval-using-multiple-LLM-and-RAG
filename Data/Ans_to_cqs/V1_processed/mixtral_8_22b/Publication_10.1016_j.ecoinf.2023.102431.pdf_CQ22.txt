The given context does not provide information about the evaluation metrics used for the deep learning model. However, common metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, AUC, etc. Accuracy is the ratio of correctly predicted observations to the total observations. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made by the model. Recall measures the proportion of true positives out of all actual positives. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve plots True Positive Rate against False Positive Rate, and Area Under Curve (AUC) represents degree or measure of separability.
