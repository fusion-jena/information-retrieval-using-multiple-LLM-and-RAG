The text does not provide direct information about addressing data bias specifically in the context of deep learning pipelines. However, it discusses some relevant concepts that could be applied to mitigate data imbalance, such as stratification and diverse data collection.

In the context of species distribution modeling, the authors mention making three random selections of background points from the training dataset for use during model construction. This process resembles stratified sampling, where the goal is to ensure that different classes or categories in the dataset are represented proportionally. By selecting the same number of background points as presences ("1x" selection), ten times the number of presences ("10x" selection"), or a fixed number of 10,000 background points ("10K" selection), the authors aim to maintain consistency across background points used to train each model. This approach minimizes variations in model results due to differences in the response variable.

Although not explicitly mentioned, oversampling and undersampling techniques could also be employed to handle class imbalances in datasets. Oversampling involves duplicating examples from the minority class, while undersampling reduces instances from the majority class. These techniques help achieve a balanced dataset, improving the model's predictive capabilities.

Diverse data collection is another strategy that can indirectly reduce data bias. Collecting various types of data from multiple sources ensures that the dataset represents real-world scenarios accurately. While not directly discussed in the given context, incorporating diverse data can improve the generalizability and robustness of models.

In summary, although the text does not directly address data bias in deep learning pipelines, it touches upon relevant strategies such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. These techniques can help manage data imbalances and biases, ultimately enhancing the performance and reliability of machine learning models.
