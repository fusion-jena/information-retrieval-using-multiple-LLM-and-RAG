In the context provided, there isn't explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer from the description of the experiments conducted that they involve using images or photographs of plants.

For instance, in the 'Hand-crafted Feature Extraction Experiment', a dataset named 'D' is mentioned, which could potentially refer to a collection of plant images. Similarly, in the 'Deep Learning Experiment', the process involves resizing images to 224x224 pixels before feeding them into the network.

While these details do not directly mention the use of surveys, sensors, or public datasets, they suggest that the raw data collected for this particular study might have been image data, possibly sourced from existing databases or captured specifically for this research.

To provide a more definitive answer, additional context would be required, detailing the exact methodologies employed for gathering the raw data used in these experiments.
