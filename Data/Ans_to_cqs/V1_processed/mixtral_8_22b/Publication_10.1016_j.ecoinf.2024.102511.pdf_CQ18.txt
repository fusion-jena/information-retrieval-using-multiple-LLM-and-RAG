The provided context does not explicitly mention a specific strategy for monitoring the model performance during training. However, it does provide some insights into the requirements for successful implementation of the BANTER model, which is used for automated machine learning classification.

The text suggests that reliable training data is crucial for the success of the BANTER model. This includes labels with strong confidence in species identity, ideally determined by agreement from more than one analyst. Additionally, the sample sizes should be large enough to explain the natural variability in the data. These requirements imply that careful attention needs to be paid to the quality and quantity of the training data to ensure the model performs well.

Moreover, the context mentions that all species and events would ideally be included in the classification model to better represent the local species diversity and variability found in the area. This indicates that comprehensive coverage of the dataset is important for effective modeling.

However, the context also acknowledges that there might be challenges in determining species identity when calls are highly variable and do not include at least one call that provides high confidence of species identity. In such cases, it recommends that training data include a high level of confidence for inclusion, particularly for species with small sample sizes.

In conclusion, while the context does not directly address the strategy for monitoring the model performance during training, it emphasizes the importance of using reliable and representative training data for the successful implementation of the BANTER model. Regular evaluation of the model's performance against these criteria could potentially serve as a strategy for monitoring its performance during training.
