The given context does not provide specific information about data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it mentions that machine learning methods require text preprocessing, including word segmentation and stop word removal, followed by selecting a portion of text to manually annotate emotions for accuracy verification. This suggests that emotion labeling might have been employed as part of their data annotation process. Nevertheless, without explicit details regarding other annotation techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, we cannot definitively state what specific data annotation techniques were utilized in their deep learning pipeline.
