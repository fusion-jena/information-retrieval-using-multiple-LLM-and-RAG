The paper does not provide explicit details regarding specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the Random Forest (RF) algorithm was utilized for machine learning training, using 34 ground data points. The RF method provides an unbiased internal estimation of the generalization error through out-of-bag (OOB) samples, which are not included in the training subset. This implies that some form of cross-validation or bootstrapping might have been applied during the training process. Additionally, the paper states that the total number of samples used for validation is 8, suggesting that a separate validation set was created to evaluate the performance of the trained model. Nevertheless, further details such as whether stratified sampling was implemented or if diverse datasets were incorporated remain undisclosed within the given context.
