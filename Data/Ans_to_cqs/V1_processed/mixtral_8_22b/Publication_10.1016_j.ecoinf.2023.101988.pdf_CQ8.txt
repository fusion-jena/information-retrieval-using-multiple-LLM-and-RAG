The information provided does not explicitly mention the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in any of these studies. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based solely on the given context. It would be best to refer to each study individually or contact their respective authors for more detailed information about the availability of their code repositories.
