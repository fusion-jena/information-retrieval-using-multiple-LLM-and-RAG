The pipeline uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, which is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN). LSTMs are particularly well-suited for handling sequential data and capturing long-term dependencies, making them ideal for tasks such as carbon emission forecasting. Other types of deep learning models mentioned in the context include Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) and Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU), but the primary model employed in this case is the LSTM neural network.
