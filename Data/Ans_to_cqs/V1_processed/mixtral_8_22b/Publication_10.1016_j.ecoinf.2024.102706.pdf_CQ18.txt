To monitor the model performance during training, a strategy involving the use of various metrics such as R2, RMSE, rRMSE, and MAE was employed. These metrics helped evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the models in predicting forest canopy cover. Additionally, the models were trained using different datasets - one for training and another for testing. This allowed for the comparison of model performance between these two sets, ensuring that the models did not suffer from overfitting. Furthermore, the variable importance was also considered while fitting the models into the training data. Lastly, the optimized hyperparameter values were determined through a process called grid search, which involved trying out different combinations of hyperparameters within specified ranges until the best combination was found.
