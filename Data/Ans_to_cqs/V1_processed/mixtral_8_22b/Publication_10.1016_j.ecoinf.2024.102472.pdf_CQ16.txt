Training completion criteria are not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, there are some indicators that suggest how training might have been considered complete. In the case of gradient boosting iterations, which involve increasing or decreasing weights in a training dataset, the completion could be determined by reaching a certain number of iterations or achieving a desired level of accuracy. Similarly, during the MLPNN (Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network) training phase, the completion criterion appears to be reaching a target minimal error. This is achieved through iterative error back-propagation adjusting connection weights. Additionally, specific parameters such as learning rate (0.01), momentum (0.18), and training iterations (500) were tested to determine their optimal values, suggesting that these factors may also play a role in determining when training is complete.
