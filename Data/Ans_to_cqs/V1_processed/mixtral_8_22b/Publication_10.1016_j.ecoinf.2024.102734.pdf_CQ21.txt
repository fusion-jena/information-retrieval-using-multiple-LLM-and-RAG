The text does not provide explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it mentions some aspects related to evaluation and testing. After training the classification models with an 80/20% training-validation split, the performance is evaluated using both validation and test datasets. The test dataset consists of 500 segments, including 187 possum vocalizations and 313 noise samples, manually reviewed by humans. It also states that both validation and test dataset performance are reported, but it doesn't specify what kind of metrics are calculated or if any visualization techniques like saliency maps or confusion matrices are employed. Therefore, without additional context, it cannot be determined precisely what postprocessing steps are involved after the model training.
