The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that the model is designed for image classification tasks. This is evident from the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the mention of different architectures such as AlexNet, DenseNet, GoogLeNet, Inception, MobileNet, Resnet, Resnext, VGG, and Xception. Furthermore, the study mentions training five CNN models based on Inception v.3 using two optimization techniques, transfer learning, and data augmentation. Finally, the goal is to classify new 396 images with different tree cover in global drylands using the built CNN-based model. Therefore, it can be concluded that the primary objective of the deep learning model is to perform image classification tasks related to tree cover in global drylands.
