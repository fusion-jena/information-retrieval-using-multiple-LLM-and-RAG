The sources cited do not provide explicit details about specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, they suggest that remote sensing technologies are employed for gathering large volumes of environmental data. For instance, Ustin et al. (2002) discuss using hyperspectral remote sensing for invasive species detection and mapping. Similarly, Prasai et al. (2021) mention utilizing Google Earth Engine Python API and NAIP imagery for land use and land cover classification. These examples indicate that satellite or airborne images could serve as primary sources of raw data in such applications. Additionally, Vali et al. (2020) review deep learning approaches for land use and land cover classification based on hyperspectral and multispectral earth observation data, further emphasizing the role of remote sensing in providing input data for these models. While the exact methodology for acquiring raw data may vary depending on the application, it appears that remote sensing plays a significant part in supplying the necessary data for deep learning pipelines in ecological studies.
