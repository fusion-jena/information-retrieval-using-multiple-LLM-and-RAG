Unfortunately, there isn't any explicit information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the given context. Data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, etc., can be used to increase the diversity of the training data without collecting new samples. These methods help prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize. However, since the context does not provide details regarding the specific data augmentation techniques employed, it is impossible to give a precise answer based solely on the available information.
