The text does not provide explicit information on specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it mentions that the biases were reflected by cross-validations, indicating that some form of validation technique might be employed. Additionally, the authors acknowledge that downscaling techniques could encounter difficulties due to limitations in capturing climate-forcing effects not initially present in the coarse-scale products. This suggests that the researchers may have considered these challenges while designing their approach but does not explicitly mention any preprocessing techniques to address data bias.
