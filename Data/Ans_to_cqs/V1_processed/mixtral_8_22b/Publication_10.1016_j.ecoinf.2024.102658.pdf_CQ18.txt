The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, it can be inferred that the authors follow an iterative modeling process based on the Bayesian workflow described by Gelman et al. (Gelman et al., 2020). In this process, they repeatedly inspect the outputs of a model, analyze the effects of the model and its configurations, and adjust the configurations or switch to another model type according to their observations. This cyclical approach allows them to systematically evaluate and improve the model performance throughout the training phase.
