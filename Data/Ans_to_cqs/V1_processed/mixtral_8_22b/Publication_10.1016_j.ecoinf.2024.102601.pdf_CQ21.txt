The text does not provide explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps used after model training. However, it can be inferred from the given context that some form of hyperparameter optimization was performed using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV methods from the scikit-learn library. These techniques help improve the performance of the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. Additionally, the text mentions the use of SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), which is a game theoretic approach to explain the output of any machine learning model. SHAP calculates the contribution of each feature to the final prediction, helping identify the most important features or predictors. While these details do not directly address the postprocessing steps mentioned in the query, they suggest potential avenues for further analysis and evaluation of the trained model.
