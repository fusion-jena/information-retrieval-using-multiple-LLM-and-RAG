According to the given context, the deep learning model was trained using a desktop PC equipped with an Intel QuadCore CPU (Intel i5-6600) and an NVidia GTX 1070 GPU. Therefore, it can be concluded that the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model include both CPUs and GPUs. However, there is no mention of any use of TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) in this context.
