In this study, several data augmentation techniques were employed to address the issue of overfitting and improve the generalization of deep learning models. The data augmentation techniques applied include horizontal and vertical translations, which were performed within a range of 30 to 30 pixels, allowing random shifts. Additionally, shear distortion was applied within a range of 5 to 5, representing maximum distortion to the left and right. However, it should be noted that the exact types of data augmentation techniques used may vary depending on the specific requirements of the study or application.
