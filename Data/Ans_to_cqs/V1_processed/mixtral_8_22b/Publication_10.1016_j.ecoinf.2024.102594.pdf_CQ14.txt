The paper titled "Enhancing Land Cover/Land Use (LCLU) classification through a comparative analysis of hyperparameters optimization approaches for deep neural network (DNN)" discusses the optimization of hyperparameters for DNN models used in land cover/land use classification. However, it does not explicitly mention which specific methods such as grid search or random search are used for this purpose. Instead, it focuses on comparing different optimization algorithms like Bayesian Optimization, Genetic Algorithm, and Particle Swarm Optimization. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot determine the exact method used for hyperparameter optimization in this case.
