The given context does not provide specific information on the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the model requires meteorological, soil, and vegetation data. These types of data could be collected using various methods such as weather stations or satellites for meteorological data, soil sampling for soil data, and remote sensing or field observations for vegetation data. Public datasets may also be available for these types of data. Without more specific context, it is impossible to determine exactly which methods are being used in this case.
