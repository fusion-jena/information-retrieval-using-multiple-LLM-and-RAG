The text does not provide explicit information about the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions several techniques used to improve the model's accuracy, such as transfer learning, data augmentation, and dropout. These methods are commonly employed to prevent overfitting and enhance the generalization capabilities of deep learning models. Additionally, the text discusses the use of a ResNet-50 network architecture, which has been proven effective for handling complex datasets like the one presented here. It also highlights the importance of the image acquisition protocol and its impact on the model's ability to process features accurately. Lastly, the text presents various metrics related to misclassified images and accuracy rates for different stages of the training process, suggesting that these indicators were likely used to evaluate the model's performance.
