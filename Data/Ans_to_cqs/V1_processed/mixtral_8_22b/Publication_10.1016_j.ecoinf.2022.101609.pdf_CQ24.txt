The provided context does not directly address the specific strategies used to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, including managing random seed values. However, it can be inferred that some common practices include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, employing techniques like cross-validation, and utilizing ensemble models to reduce variance caused by randomness. Additionally, hyperparameter tuning and regularization methods may also help manage randomness in deep learning pipelines.
