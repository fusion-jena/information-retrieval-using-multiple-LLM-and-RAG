Based on the given context, it appears that the study focuses on applying deep learning models to predict diving locations of birds monitored with GPS devices. However, there is no explicit mention of specific data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation within this context. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer based solely on the provided text.

However, generally speaking, in deep learning pipelines, various data annotation techniques can be employed depending on the nature of the task. For example, object detection tasks often involve bounding box annotations around objects of interest, while semantic segmentation tasks require pixel-level labeling of images. Instance segmentation combines both approaches, providing detailed annotations for individual instances of objects within an image. These techniques help train deep learning models to recognize patterns and make accurate predictions.
