In the given context, there is no mention of any specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). Instead, the text focuses on the use of Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and Random Forest Regression (RFR) algorithms for bathymetry prediction.

For the CART algorithm, the authors fine-tune specific model parameters like'max\_depth','min\_samples\_leaf', and'max\_leaf\_nodes'. They select these parameter values to prevent overfitting and minimize cross-validation error in their model.

Similarly, when implementing the RFR model, they utilize the Python programming language and import the RFR algorithm from the'sklearn' library. Here too, they fine-tune model parameters such as 'n\_estimators'.

However, without further information about the training process or the specific libraries used, it is not possible to determine which optimization techniques might be involved in this deep learning pipeline.
