The authors did not explicitly mention a specific strategy to monitor the model performance during training. However, they mentioned using Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification and obtaining a clean separation for the training database with over 85% accuracy. They also stated that they built as many classifiers as there are classes, and each classifier discriminated one class against all the others. Therefore, it can be inferred that the authors might have monitored the model performance during training through evaluating the accuracy of their SVM classifiers on the training dataset. Additionally, they may have employed techniques such as cross-validation or early stopping to prevent overfitting and ensure optimal performance.
