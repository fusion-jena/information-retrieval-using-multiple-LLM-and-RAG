The context does not explicitly mention specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does allude to certain challenges faced when using traditional methods such as dive visual censuses performed by divers. These challenges include limitations in terms of depth, time constraints, and the slow rate of data collection. Despite these limitations, dive visual censuses have still been used to gather a significant amount of information about shallow habitats. Additionally, the context mentions the use of large databases for training models, which could potentially be public datasets or other sources of pre-existing data. It also references studies related to oceanography and marine mammal species detection, suggesting that sensor data may play a role in gathering raw data for deep learning applications in these areas. Overall, while the exact methods used for collecting raw data are not specified, the context implies that various techniques such as dive visual censuses, public datasets, and possibly sensor data may be employed depending on the specific application.
