The text does not provide explicit information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it can be inferred from general machine learning practices that common criteria include reaching a validation loss plateau or achieving a desired level of performance on a separate validation dataset. These criteria help ensure that the model has learned useful patterns without overfitting to the training data.

Based on the table provided, it appears that the algorithm-based image classification was evaluated using independent validation data labeled 'CK data'. This suggests that the model's performance was assessed on unseen data during training, which aligns with best practices for determining when training should be stopped. Without further details about the training process, it cannot be definitively stated what exact criteria were used to decide when training was complete.
