The given context does not provide information about the evaluation metrics used for the deep learning model. However, common metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, AUC, etc. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of total instances. Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives. Recall or sensitivity is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all actual positives. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve plots True Positive Rate against False Positive Rate, and Area Under Curve (AUC) represents degree or measure of separability.
