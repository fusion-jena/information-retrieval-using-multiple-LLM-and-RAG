There are several techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same proportion of classes in each set. This ensures that the classifier learns from a representative sample of the entire dataset.

Oversampling is a technique used when there is a significant imbalance in the number of instances belonging to different classes. It involves duplicating some instances of the minority class until it has the same number of instances as the majority class. This helps prevent the classifier from being biased towards the majority class.

Undersampling is another technique used to handle class imbalance. It involves removing some instances of the majority class until it has the same number of instances as the minority class. This can help reduce overfitting and improve the generalization ability of the classifier.

Diverse data collection involves collecting data from various sources to ensure that the dataset is representative of the real world. This can help prevent the classifier from being biased towards certain types of data.

These techniques can be combined to achieve better results. For example, stratified sampling can be used along with oversampling or undersampling to create balanced datasets. Additionally, diverse data collection can be used to collect data from multiple sources before using stratified sampling, oversampling, or undersampling.
