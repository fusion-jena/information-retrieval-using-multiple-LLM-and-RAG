The information provided does not explicitly mention where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it suggests that the Footprint Identification Technique (FIT) method can be enhanced by collecting imperfect footprints and using missing value imputation as part of the data preprocessing pipeline. It also mentions a study using deep learning models to classify three sympatric otter species, but no specific details about the availability or location of the dataset are given. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer based on the information provided.
