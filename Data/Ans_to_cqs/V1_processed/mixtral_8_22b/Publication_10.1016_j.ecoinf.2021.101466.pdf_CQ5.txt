The text does not provide specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the EfficientNet was trained using a data augmentation method on 4000 images per category. It is also mentioned that the capacity of the EfficientNet was evaluated over various benchmark datasets. Unfortunately, the names of these benchmark datasets are not explicitly stated in the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive list of the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
