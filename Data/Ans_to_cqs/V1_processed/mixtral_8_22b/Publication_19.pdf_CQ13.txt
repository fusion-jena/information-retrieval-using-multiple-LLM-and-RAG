The hyperparameters used in the deep learning models include the learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs. These values were determined through a process called grid search. For the Inception-V3 model, the learning rate was set to 0.05, the batch size was set to 48, and the number of epochs was set to 75. Similarly, for the MobileNet-V2 model, the learning rate was set to 0.01, the batch size was set to 32, and the number of epochs was set to 100. For the ResNet-18 model, the learning rate was set to 0.005, the batch size was set to 32, and the number of epochs was set to 150. Lastly, for the DenseNet-121 model, the learning rate was set to 0.001, the batch size was set to 16, and the number of epochs was set to 100. All models used stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as their optimizer.
