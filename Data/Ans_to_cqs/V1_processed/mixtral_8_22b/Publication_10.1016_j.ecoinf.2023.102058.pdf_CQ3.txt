Based on the given context, there is no specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key points or landmark annotation, and image classification. These techniques help label the input data so that the machine learning algorithm can learn patterns and relationships between the labeled features and their corresponding outputs. In this case, since the study focuses on applying deep learning algorithms to hyperspectral data to predict water quality parameters, it is likely that some form of pixel-level annotation technique such as semantic segmentation or instance segmentation may have been used to identify and classify different water quality parameters within the hyperspectral images. However, without more specific information, it cannot be confirmed which exact data annotation techniques were used in this particular study.
