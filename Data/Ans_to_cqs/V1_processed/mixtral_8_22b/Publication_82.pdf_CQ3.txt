The given context does not provide information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that one of the parameters varied in the experimental configurations is the choice of dataset type, including color, grayscale, and leaf segmented datasets. This suggests that some form of image preprocessing or annotation may have been applied to these datasets before being used in the deep learning models. Unfortunately, without more detailed information about how these datasets were prepared, I cannot specify whether techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation were employed.
