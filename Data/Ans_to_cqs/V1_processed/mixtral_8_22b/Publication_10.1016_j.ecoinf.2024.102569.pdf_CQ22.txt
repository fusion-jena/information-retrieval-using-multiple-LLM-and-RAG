Based on the provided context, it appears that the Root Trimmed Mean Squared Prediction Error (RTMSPE) is utilized to evaluate the performance of the model. This metric is employed to select the appropriate values for the tuning parameters τ and ϕ, removing the impact of heterogeneous observations. The RTMSPE is calculated using the formula presented in equation (6) of the context, where e^2 [i] represents the square of the i-th residual, h_δ denotes the number of non-trimmed observations, and δ is a trimming proportion between 0 and 1. However, it should be noted that this context does not explicitly mention any traditional evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall, which are often used in evaluating the performance of machine learning models. Therefore, without additional information, it cannot be definitively stated whether these metrics are also being used to assess the performance of the deep learning model discussed here.
