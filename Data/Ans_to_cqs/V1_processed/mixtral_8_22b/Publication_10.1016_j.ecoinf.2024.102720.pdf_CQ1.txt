Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, common methods for gathering such data include using sensors, conducting surveys, utilizing publicly available datasets, web scraping, and more. It is important to note that the choice of method depends on the nature of the problem being addressed and the type of data required for training the deep learning model. For instance, if one needs spatial data, remote sensing techniques can be employed, while temporal data may require time series analysis. Therefore, without further details regarding the specific application or project mentioned in the context, it cannot be determined which methods were used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
