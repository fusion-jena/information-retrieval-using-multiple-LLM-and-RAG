The text does not provide information about specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it mentions the use of two prominent models - RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV - from the scikit-learn library for hyperparameter optimization of the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. These methods help improve the performance of the RF algorithm by searching through different combinations of hyperparameters. RandomizedSearchCV uses a probabilistic approach to explore the hyperparameter space, while GridSearchCV performs an exhaustive search over a predefined set of hyperparameters. Both these methods aid in finding the optimal hyperparameters for the given problem.
