The text does not provide explicit information about the specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to perform various preprocessing techniques such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization involves transforming the data so that it falls within a certain range, often between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. Scaling refers to adjusting the values measured on different scales to a common scale. Cleaning involves handling missing or inconsistent data points. These preprocessing steps help improve the performance and efficiency of the deep learning model during training.
