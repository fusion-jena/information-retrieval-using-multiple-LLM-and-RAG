The given context does not provide any information about the deployment of a trained deep learning model or its related aspects like model serialization or platform selection. It primarily discusses the use of a TPINet-based process network approach to identify causal links between variables in a pine-dominated ecosystem. The focus is on analyzing sub-daily scale processes using this methodology. Hence, I am unable to provide an answer regarding the deployment of a trained deep learning model based on the given context.
