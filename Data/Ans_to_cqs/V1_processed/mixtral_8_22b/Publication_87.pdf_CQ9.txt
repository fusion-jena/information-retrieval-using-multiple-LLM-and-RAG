The document does not provide information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It discusses the process of collecting images with camera traps, preparing data, training models, and predicting new images using a subset of the original dataset. However, there is no mention of where the complete dataset or any part of it has been made publicly available. Therefore, I do not have enough information to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
