The provided context does not directly discuss the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices. These concepts are typically associated with machine learning applications, particularly in computer vision tasks like image classification or object detection.

However, based on the given context, we can infer that after training a model for analyzing animal movement data, one might perform validation of classifications using additional behavioral observations. Additionally, the context mentions the use of state-space models and hidden Markov models for behavioral segmentation of animal movement paths. After applying these models, it may be necessary to interpret the results, which could involve visualizing the predicted states over time or calculating summary statistics related to the identified behaviors.

To summarize, while the provided context does not explicitly mention postprocessing steps like saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices, it suggests that validating classifications and interpreting results would be important steps following model training in the context of analyzing animal movement data.
