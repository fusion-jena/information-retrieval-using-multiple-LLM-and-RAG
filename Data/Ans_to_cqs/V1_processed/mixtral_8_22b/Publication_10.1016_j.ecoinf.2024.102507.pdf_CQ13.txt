Based on the given context, the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model such as learning rate and optimizer are not explicitly mentioned. However, it is stated that the models were configured with Input(shape = (64, 64, band_num)) and set weights to None. For 'include top', it was specified as False. Also, Dropout layers with Dropout\_Rate were included in the model along with Dense layers with ReLU and softmax activations. It is important to note that these details do not provide information about the learning rate or optimizer used in the model. Therefore, without additional context, I cannot provide the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
