After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the project or task. However, based on the provided context, there isn't any explicit mention of postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, confusion matrices, or other metrics calculations. Nevertheless, from the information available, we can infer that the models underwent evaluation using certain metrics like Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), as shown in Table 1. These metrics help assess the performance of the models on the test dataset. Additionally, Fig. 4 displays actual versus predicted numbers of animals, providing visual insights into the accuracy of predictions made by the models. In summary, while the exact postprocessing steps aren't explicitly mentioned, the context suggests that the models were evaluated using error metrics and visual comparisons between actual and predicted values.
