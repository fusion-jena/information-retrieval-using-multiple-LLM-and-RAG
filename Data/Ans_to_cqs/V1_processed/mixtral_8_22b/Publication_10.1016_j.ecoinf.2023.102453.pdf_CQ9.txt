According to the given context, there isn't explicit mention of where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, under the 'Data Availability' section, it states that "Data will be made available on request." This suggests that the data might not currently be publicly accessible but can be requested directly from the researchers involved in the study. Therefore, without additional information, I cannot definitively state which platform hosts the data repository, such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
