The given context does not provide specific information about the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, shearing, and brightness adjustment. These techniques help increase the size of the dataset and improve the generalization ability of the model. It is important to note that the choice of data augmentation technique depends on the nature of the problem and the characteristics of the dataset. Without more specific details about the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context, it is impossible to determine which data augmentation techniques were applied.
