Unfortunately, based on the provided information, there is no explicit mention of a specific code repository for the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct link to the code repository. However, it might be worth checking out related papers and resources mentioned in the text, such as those authored by Zhu et al. (2019) and Schindler and Steinhage (2021). These authors have published studies on deep learning techniques for identifying animals and recognizing their actions in wildlife videos. Additionally, exploring Intel's work on efficient implementation of neural networks built on FPGAs could also prove helpful.
