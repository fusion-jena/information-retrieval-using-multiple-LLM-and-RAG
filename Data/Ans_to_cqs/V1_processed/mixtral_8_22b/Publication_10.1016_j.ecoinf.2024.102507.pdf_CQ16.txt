The context does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, common practices include monitoring metrics such as validation loss or accuracy during training and stopping when these values reach a plateau or desired threshold. Additionally, early stopping can be employed based on performance on a separate validation set. Without further details from the given context, it cannot be definitively stated which criteria were used in this particular case.
