The text does not provide information on which specific frameworks were used to build the deep learning models. It only mentions different types of architectures such as ResNet, InceptionTime, LSTM, and CNN, but it does not specify if they were built using TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other framework. Therefore, I do not have enough information to determine which frameworks were used to build the deep learning models.
