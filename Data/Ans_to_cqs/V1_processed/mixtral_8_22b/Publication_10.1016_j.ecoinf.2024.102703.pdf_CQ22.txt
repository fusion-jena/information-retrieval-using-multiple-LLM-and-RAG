To evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, specifically the Back Propagation (BP) Artificial Neural Network used in this case, two main metrics are employed: the Coefficient of Determination (R^2) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). These metrics help measure how well the predicted Trophic State Index (TSI) matches the actual or measured TSI.

The Coefficient of Determination (R^2), often referred to as the R-squared value, indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable (in this case, TSI) explained by the independent variables (aCDOM(254) and Fn(355)). A high R^2 value suggests that the model has a good fit and explains much of the variability in the data.

On the other hand, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) measures the difference between the predicted and observed values. Lower RMSE values indicate better model performance since they signify smaller differences between the predicted and actual TSI.

In summary, the performance of the deep learning model in this scenario is evaluated using the Coefficient of Determination (R^2) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). These metrics provide insights into how accurately the model predicts the Trophic State Index based on the given inputs.
