The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipelines discussed. However, based on the information given, we can infer that some form of structured numerical data was likely used for both studies. For instance, Nguyen et al. (2019) discuss mapping vegetation types using a random forest approach, which suggests they may have utilized geospatial data such as satellite imagery or LiDAR point clouds. Similarly, Castro and Farias (2020) modeled increment in diameter of individual trees, implying they might have worked with tabular data containing measurements related to tree dimensions and other relevant features. Nevertheless, without further details about the exact datasets employed in these studies, it remains uncertain what specific data formats were involved in their respective deep learning pipelines.
