Regularization is a technique used in machine learning and deep learning models to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function during training. This helps to reduce the complexity of the model and improve its ability to generalize to new data. In the context of deep learning pipelines, there are several regularization methods commonly used to prevent overfitting.

One popular method is Dropout, which randomly drops out neurons from the network during training. This prevents any single neuron from becoming too influential and encourages the network to learn more robust features. Another common method is L2 Regularization, also known as weight decay, which adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the weights to the loss function. This encourages smaller weights and reduces the risk of overfitting.

Other regularization methods include Early Stopping, where training is stopped when validation error starts increasing instead of decreasing; Data Augmentation, where additional synthetic data is generated to increase the size of the training set; and Batch Normalization, which normalizes the inputs to each layer of the network to reduce internal covariate shift.

These regularization methods are often combined in practice to achieve optimal results. For example, Dropout and L2 Regularization can be used together to further reduce overfitting. Ultimately, the choice of regularization method depends on the specific problem being solved and the characteristics of the data being used.
