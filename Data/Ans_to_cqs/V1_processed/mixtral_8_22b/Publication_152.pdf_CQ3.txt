Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for vegetation identification from UAV images. However, it can be inferred that some form of image labeling or segmentation was employed due to the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs typically require labeled datasets for training and validation purposes.

In general, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. Bounding box annotation involves drawing a rectangle around objects of interest within an image. Semantic segmentation entails assigning each pixel in an image to a class label, while instance segmentation further differentiates individual instances of the same object class.

Considering the application of identifying specific vegetation mixed with native vegetation from UAV flights mentioned in the context, it is likely that either semantic segmentation or instance segmentation was utilized. These techniques would allow for precise delineation of various vegetation types within the collected images. Nevertheless, without more detailed information about the dataset preparation process, it cannot be definitively stated which specific data annotation technique was applied.
