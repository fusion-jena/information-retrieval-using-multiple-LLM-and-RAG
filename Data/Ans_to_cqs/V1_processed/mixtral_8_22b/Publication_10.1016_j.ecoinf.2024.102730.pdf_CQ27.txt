The provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, including details about model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a specific answer based solely on the given information. However, typically after training a deep learning model, the next steps would involve saving or serializing the model, selecting a suitable deployment platform, and then integrating the serialized model into the chosen platform for real-world applications.
