The text does not provide specific information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some common techniques include stratified splitting, which involves splitting the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes or labels in both sets. Oversampling is another technique where synthetic samples are created from existing minority class examples to balance the dataset. Undersampling, on the other hand, involves removing samples from the majority class to achieve a balanced dataset. Lastly, diverse data collection aims to collect more representative data to reduce bias in the dataset. These techniques help ensure that the model learns from a fair representation of all classes or labels, reducing potential biases in the final predictions.
