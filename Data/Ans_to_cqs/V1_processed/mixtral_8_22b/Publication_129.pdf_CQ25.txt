The purpose of the deep learning model used in this case is object detection and classification. This is evident from the use of the Faster R-CNN approach, which is a type of convolutional neural network designed specifically for object detection tasks. The Faster R-CNN model uses a Region Proposal Network (RPN) to propose potential object locations within the input image, and then applies a classifier and regressor to refine these location predictions and assign class labels to them. The goal of this process is to accurately detect and identify specific objects - in this case, agricultural insect pests - within the input images.
