The given context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the data format used could be related to environmental studies, particularly concerning water bodies and wind speeds. This suggests that the data format might include satellite imagery, such as those obtained from Sentinel-2 or Landsat-8, which are mentioned in some of the cited works. These types of data are often processed as images or raster datasets. Additionally, the context mentions the use of neural networks for tasks like classification and regression, which are common techniques applied to various data formats including images, audio, video, and CSV files. Therefore, while the exact data format cannot be determined solely from the provided context, it is reasonable to assume that the deep learning pipeline may involve processing image data derived from satellite sources.
