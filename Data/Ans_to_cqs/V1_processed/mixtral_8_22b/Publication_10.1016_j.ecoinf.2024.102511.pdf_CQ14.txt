The text does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, there is mention of selecting small values for'sampsize' to improve computational performance and using large values for 'ntree' to achieve stable classification results. This suggests some form of optimization or tuning was performed, although the specific method (grid search, random search, etc.) is not mentioned.
