The text does not provide information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that the authors worked with a high number of randomly chosen species from an initial set of 7626 species, selecting species with more than 300 observations and creating subsets E1000, E200, and E50. However, there is no mention of where this data is stored or made publicly available. Therefore, I do not know where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
