To ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the authors used a diverse dataset consisting of satellite images from different regions and seasons. This helped to capture various features and patterns present in the images, making the model more robust and applicable to different scenarios. Secondly, they employed data augmentation techniques such as rotation, zoom, shear, horizontal and vertical shifts, brightness adjustments, and flips (both horizontally and vertically). These techniques increased the diversity of the training set without collecting new data, further enhancing the model's ability to generalize well. Lastly, while not explicitly mentioned in the given context, it can be assumed that some form of validation technique like k-fold cross-validation or stratified splitting might have been utilized during the development phase to prevent overfitting and assess the model's performance accurately. However, this assumption cannot be confirmed based solely on the provided information.
