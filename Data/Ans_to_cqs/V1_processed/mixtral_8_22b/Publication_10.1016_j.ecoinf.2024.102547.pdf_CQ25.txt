The information provided does not directly state the specific purpose of the deep learning model being used. However, based on the given context, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is likely being used for spectral analysis and modeling, with a focus on exploring the relationship between SSL descriptors such as thickness, depth, and density. These descriptors are treated as observations of a real-valued spatial process. Additionally, the analysis includes dimension reduction techniques, as well as supervised and unsupervised methods, taking into consideration spatial dependencies within extensive datasets. Therefore, while the exact purpose of the deep learning model cannot be definitively determined from the provided context, it appears to involve some form of pattern recognition or prediction related to these SSL descriptors and their distribution across a spatial domain.
