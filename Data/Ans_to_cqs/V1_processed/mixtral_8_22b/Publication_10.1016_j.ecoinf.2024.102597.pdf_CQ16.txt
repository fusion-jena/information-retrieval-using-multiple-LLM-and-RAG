The text does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, common practices in machine learning include monitoring metrics like validation loss or accuracy during training and stopping when these values reach a plateau or no longer improve significantly. This can be done manually or automatically through early stopping mechanisms. Other possible criteria could involve reaching a predefined number of epochs or iterations, achieving a target performance level, or exceeding a maximum allowed time limit for training. Without more details, it cannot be definitively stated which criteria were employed in this particular case.
