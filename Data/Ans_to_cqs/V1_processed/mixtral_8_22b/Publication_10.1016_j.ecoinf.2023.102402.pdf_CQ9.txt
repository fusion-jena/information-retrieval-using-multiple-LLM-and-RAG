The authors do not explicitly mention where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, they provide a list of sources from which they obtained presence records for H. guttulatus and H. hippocampus, including Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS), iNaturalist, AquaMaps, and literature such as Zhang and Vincent (2018). They also state that further details on how to obtain their presence data can be found in the Data Availability section. Therefore, it is likely that the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available through one or more of these sources. To confirm this, readers should refer to the Data Availability section of the paper.
