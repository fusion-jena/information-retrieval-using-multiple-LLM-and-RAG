After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be taken to evaluate the performance of the machine learning models used in this study. These include calculating metrics such as overall accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and kappa coefficient. Additionally, confusion matrices can be generated to visualize the performance of the models by comparing predicted labels with actual labels. Another useful tool for evaluating model performance is saliency maps, which highlight important features contributing to the final prediction. However, due to the lack of information regarding specific postprocessing steps mentioned in the given context, I cannot provide detailed instructions on how to perform these tasks. Nonetheless, these general guidelines should help guide further analysis of the results obtained from the machine learning models used in this study.
