Unfortunately, the provided context does not directly address the query about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, based on general knowledge about deep learning practices, there are several strategies often used to manage randomness:

1. **Fixed Random Seeds**: One common strategy is setting fixed random seeds for various parts of the pipeline, including data preprocessing, model initialization, and even data loading. By fixing these seeds, one can ensure reproducibility across multiple runs of the same experiment.

2. **Deterministic Algorithms**: Another way to reduce randomness is using deterministic algorithms wherever possible. For instance, some operations like sorting can have both stochastic and deterministic implementations. Choosing the latter ensures consistency between runs.

3. **Cross-Validation**: To account for variability introduced by random splits of train/test sets, cross-validation techniques can be employed. K-fold cross-validation involves splitting the dataset into k subsets, then iteratively holding out each subset as a test set while training on the remaining data. This helps average out any effects caused by a particularly favorable or unfavorable split.

4. **Ensemble Methods**: Ensembling combines predictions from multiple models trained independently. Since each model sees slightly different data due to shuffling or augmentation, ensembles can help smooth over variations caused by randomness.
