The papers mentioned do not explicitly discuss specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, or scaling within their respective deep learning pipelines. However, it can be assumed that some form of data augmentation may have been used due to its common application in improving the performance of machine learning models. Data augmentation helps prevent overfitting and improves generalization by creating new training examples through various transformations applied to existing images. Without explicit mention of these techniques in the given sources, one cannot definitively state which methods were employed.
