Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the provided context to determine what specific data augmentation techniques have been used in the deep learning pipeline. However, some common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, and shifting images. These techniques help improve model performance and prevent overfitting by increasing the diversity of training data without collecting new data.
