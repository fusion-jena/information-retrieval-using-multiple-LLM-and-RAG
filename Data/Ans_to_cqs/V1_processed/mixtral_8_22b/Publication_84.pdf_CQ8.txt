The article does not provide information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that Google Earth Engine (GEE) was used for processing large-scale remote sensing datasets and developing spectral-phenological features for understanding Spartina alterniflora invasion. To find out if there is a publicly accessible code repository for this study, one could search online platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket using relevant keywords like "spartina_alterniflora", "deep_learning", "remote_sensing", etc. Alternatively, contacting the authors directly might yield more specific results regarding the availability of the code repository.
