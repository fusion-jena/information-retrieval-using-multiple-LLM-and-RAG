The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it is mentioned that the final dataset consisted of 6936 tagging events under three treatments, which suggests some level of diversity in the dataset. Furthermore, the use of a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) indicates that the researchers considered random effects in their analysis, potentially accounting for variability within the dataset. Lastly, the use of the R packages glmmTMB and DHARMa to fit the model and evaluate its goodness-of-fit also implies rigorous statistical testing to validate the results. Nevertheless, without more detailed information regarding the dataset composition and preprocessing steps, it is difficult to definitively state what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
