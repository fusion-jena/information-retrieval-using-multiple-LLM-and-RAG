The provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, based on general practices in machine learning, some common strategies include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using techniques like cross-validation to reduce variability due to random sampling, and employing ensemble methods to combine multiple models trained with different initializations.
