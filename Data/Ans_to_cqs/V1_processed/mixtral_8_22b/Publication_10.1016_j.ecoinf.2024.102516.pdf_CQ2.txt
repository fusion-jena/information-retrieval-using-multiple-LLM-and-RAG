The text mentions that the network is trained with images, specifically with an input image resolution of 512 x 512 pixels. It also refers to the use of a ResNet50 architecture, which is commonly used for image recognition tasks. Furthermore, the text discusses the abundance of image data generated by smartphones and automated camera systems. Therefore, it can be concluded that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images.
