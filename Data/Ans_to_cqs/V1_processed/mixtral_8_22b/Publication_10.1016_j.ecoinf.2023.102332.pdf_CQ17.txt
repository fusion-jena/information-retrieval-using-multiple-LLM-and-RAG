The given context does not provide information about the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, it discusses various techniques related to natural language processing and text analysis, including Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) spaces, Word2Vec, and BERT. These techniques involve vector representations of words and documents, which can help capture semantic relationships between them. While these techniques do not directly address regularization methods for preventing overfitting, they contribute to building robust machine learning models by providing meaningful feature representations. Regularization methods like dropout and L2 regularization aim to reduce overfitting by adding constraints to the model parameters during training, thus improving generalization performance. Dropout randomly drops neurons during training to prevent co-adaptation among features, while L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function to discourage large weights.
