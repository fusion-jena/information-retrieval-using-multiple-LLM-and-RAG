The given context does not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. However, it does discuss some aspects related to the training and validation process of their automatic classifier.

In section 3.1, they present the results of their manual classification algorithm. In sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2, they provide training and validation results for their automatic classifier. They also mention using an SVM model with 5-fold cross-validation for training their classifier. Additionally, they describe using a basic laptop with Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9850H CPU for running the training and validation tasks.

They further explain using a ResNet-50 architecture to generate a feature vector of size 1000, which is then used to train the SVM classifier. They compare the performance of their method with softmax and highlight the advantages of their approach over softmax.

However, there is no information available regarding any postprocessing steps like saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot determine what postprocessing steps were involved after the model training.
