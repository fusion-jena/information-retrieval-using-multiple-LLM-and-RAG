The text does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, there are some clues regarding the learning rate schedule used during training. The authors mention they employed a fixed learning policy, which means the learning rate was likely manually tuned rather than automatically searched through techniques like grid search or random search. They also describe adjusting the learning rate by a factor of 10 when the validation set accuracy stops improving, indicating a form of manual learning rate scheduling. Other hyperparameters such as momentum, weight decay, and batch size appear to be set to specific values without any indication of optimization methodology. Therefore, while the exact process of hyperparameter optimization remains unclear, it appears that the authors primarily relied on manual tuning and heuristics.
