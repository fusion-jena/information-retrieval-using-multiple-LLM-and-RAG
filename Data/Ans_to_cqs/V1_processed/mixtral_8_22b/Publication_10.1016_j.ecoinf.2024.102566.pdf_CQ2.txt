The text does not provide explicit information about the data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of forest inventory data and remote sensing imagery for biomass estimation. Therefore, it can be inferred that the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline could include images or satellite data, which is often used in remote sensing applications. Additionally, the text refers to the use of field-collected data, which might suggest the use of structured data such as CSV files. However, without more specific details, it cannot be definitively stated what exact data formats were used in the deep learning pipeline.
