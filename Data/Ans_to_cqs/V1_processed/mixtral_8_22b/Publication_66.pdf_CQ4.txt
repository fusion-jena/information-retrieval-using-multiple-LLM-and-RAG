Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention or discussion of specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, scaling, etc., applied within a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer based solely on this context. However, these techniques are commonly employed in image processing tasks to increase the size of training datasets artificially, thereby improving model performance and generalization.

Flipping involves creating new images by horizontally or vertically reversing existing ones. Rotation generates additional samples by rotating images through various angles. Scaling resizes images to different dimensions while preserving their original aspect ratio. Other popular data augmentation techniques include cropping, translation, shearing, brightness adjustment, contrast manipulation, and noise injection. These methods help expose machine learning models to more diverse input variations during training, enhancing their ability to recognize patterns and features across multiple scales, orientations, and lighting conditions.
