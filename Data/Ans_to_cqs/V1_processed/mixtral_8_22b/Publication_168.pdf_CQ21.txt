After the model training, there are several postprocessing steps that can be taken to evaluate the performance of the model and gain insights into its predictions. Some common postprocessing steps include:

* Calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc. These metrics provide quantitative measures of how well the model performs on the test data.
* Generating confusion matrices to visualize the performance of the model across all classes. A confusion matrix shows the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative rates for each class.
* Creating saliency maps or heatmaps to highlight the regions of the input images that contribute most to the model's predictions. This can help identify any biases or errors in the model's decision making process.

In this paper, the authors do not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps they took after training their models. However, based on the results presented in Section IV, it appears that they calculated some form of accuracy metric to compare the performance of their proposed method (SSPCNN) against other methods (SVM, 1-D CNN, and 2-D CNN). They also generated a classification map of the entire image using their trained model, which could potentially serve as a type of saliency map if interpreted correctly.
