The text mentions several preprocessing steps taken before training a deep learning model. First, Fastai was used for data preprocessing and model training. Three key data preprocessors from Fastai were adopted: categorify, fillMissing, and normalize. Categorify maps categorical columns to distinct categories, fillMissing replaces null values with column median values, and normalize scales continuous columns by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. Additionally, the "add datepart" helper function of the library was used to generate additional predictors based on the date column, such as "Year", "DayofWeek", "DayOfYear", and "IsMonth\_End".
