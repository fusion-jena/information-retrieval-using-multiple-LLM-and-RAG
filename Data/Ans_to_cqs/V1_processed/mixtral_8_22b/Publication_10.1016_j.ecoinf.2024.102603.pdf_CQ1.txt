The provided context does not explicitly mention specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does provide some insights into the types of data that might be collected. For instance, it mentions structured and unstructured data, which could include images and text. It also refers to vegetation index extraction, suggesting that remote sensing data might be used. Furthermore, there's a reference to satellite data, specifically from instruments like the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (SENTINEL-5P TROPOMI), SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartography (ENVISAT SCIAMACHY), Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment 2 (GOME-2), Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT), and Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2). These details suggest that various sources, such as sensors, satellites, and possibly public datasets, could be used to collect raw data for a deep learning pipeline.
