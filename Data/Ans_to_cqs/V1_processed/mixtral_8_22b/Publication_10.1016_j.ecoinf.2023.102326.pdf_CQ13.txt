The given context does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text mentions the use of Python 3.8.5 and corresponding packages but does not specify which deep learning framework was employed or what hyperparameters were chosen for training the model. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based on the given context.
