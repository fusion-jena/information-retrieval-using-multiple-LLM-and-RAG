To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the endemic bird data was randomly split into 3,132 images for training and 760 images for testing. This allowed the model to learn from a diverse range of examples, improving its ability to generalize adequately. Secondly, the training dataset was augmented ten times, resulting in a total of 31,320 images. Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, scaling, and flipping were likely applied to increase the diversity of the training data further. Thirdly, the Inception-ResNet-v2 model was trained using the mini-batch gradient descent algorithm with a batch size of 32 and a learning rate of 0.0001. The Adam optimizer was also employed to fine-tune the model. Fourthly, a mechanism was proposed to swap the training and validation misclassified datasets. By doing so, the model could be retrained to correct any errors made during the initial training phase, thereby enhancing its overall performance. Lastly, five-fold cross-validation was utilized to verify the predictive performance of the model. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into k subsets or folds, then training the model on k-1 folds while validating it on the remaining fold. This process is repeated k times, each time with a different fold serving as the validation set. By averaging the results obtained from each iteration, a more robust estimate of the model's performance can be achieved. Overall, these measures helped to ensure that the deep learning model could accurately classify endemic bird species across various datasets, thus contributing to the conservation of biodiversity.
