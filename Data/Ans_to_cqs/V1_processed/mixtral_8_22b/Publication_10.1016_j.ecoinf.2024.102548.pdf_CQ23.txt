The text does not provide explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning models. However, it mentions that each model underwent training for 10 epochs utilizing a batch size of 32. Additionally, the class mode was set to 'categorical,' indicating that the labels were encoded using one-hot encoding for multi-class classification tasks. These generalized parameter settings were consistently applied across all models, ensuring comparability and standardization throughout the study experiments. While these steps contribute to maintaining consistency and fairness during the experimentation phase, they do not directly address the issue of generalizability. To improve the generalizability of the models, techniques like diverse datasets, cross-validation, stratified splitting, or regularization methods could have been employed. Unfortunately, there is no mention of these techniques in the given context.
