The text does not provide explicit information about which specific framework was used to build the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the authors applied deep learning techniques using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Both TensorFlow and PyTorch support building CNN architectures, but without further details, we cannot determine which framework was utilized.

Based on the citation "[79] Atienza, R. Advanced Deep Learning with Keras: Apply Deep Learning Techniques, Autoencoders, GANs, Variational Autoencoders, Deep Reinforcement Learning, Policy Gradients, and More; Packt Publishing Ltd.: Birmingham, UK, 2018." from the references section, there is a possibility that they might have used Keras, a high-level API built on top of TensorFlow, to develop their deep learning model. Nevertheless, this remains speculative without direct confirmation from the paper.
