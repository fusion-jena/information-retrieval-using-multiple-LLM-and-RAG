The text does not provide specific information about the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it mentions that optimal hyperparameter selection leads to improved model accuracy and enhanced prediction performance. Hyperparameters are parameters whose values are set before the learning process begins. They govern the training process and determine the overall behavior of the training algorithm. The text also mentions that k-fold cross-validation was chosen as the preferred approach for hyperparameter tuning. This technique involves dividing the development dataset into 'k' groups or folds. Each fold is then used once as a validation set while the remaining 'k - 1' folds form the training set. This process is repeated 'k' times, with each of the 'k' folds used exactly once as the validation set. The error estimation is averaged over 'k' trials to produce a single estimation. This method is particularly useful when dealing with small datasets.
