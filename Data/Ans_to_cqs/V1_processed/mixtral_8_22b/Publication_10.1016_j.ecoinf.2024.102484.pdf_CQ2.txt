The information provided does not explicitly state the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the study uses remote sensing imagery based on the mention of "high-resolution remotely sensed imagery" in one of the cited sources (Huang et al., 2019). Additionally, the ArcGIS software is mentioned, which typically deals with geospatial data such as images or maps. Therefore, it can be assumed that the deep learning pipeline likely involves image data. Nevertheless, without explicit confirmation, this remains speculative.
