The text does not provide specific information about techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some common techniques include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes in both sets. Oversampling increases the number of instances in the minority class, while undersampling reduces the number of instances in the majority class. Diverse data collection aims to gather data from various sources to ensure that the model is trained on a representative sample of the population. These techniques help prevent overfitting and improve the performance of machine learning models.
