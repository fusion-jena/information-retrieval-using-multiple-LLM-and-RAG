The given context does not provide any explicit information about the specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. However, based on common practices in machine learning research, it is likely that the authors would share their code and datasets through popular platforms such as GitHub, Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. To find out exactly where this particular deep learning pipeline is available, one could search these platforms using relevant keywords or contact the authors directly for more information.
