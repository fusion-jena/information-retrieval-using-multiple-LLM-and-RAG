Based on the given context, it appears that the data is divided into two main parts: one for training and another for testing and validation purposes. However, the exact ratio or percentage used for this division is not explicitly mentioned. It can be inferred that the majority of the data, likely more than half, is allocated for training, while the rest is reserved for testing and validation. This approach aligns with common practices in machine learning and deep learning, where the larger portion of available data is typically utilized for training models, while smaller portions are set aside for evaluating performance through testing and validation.
