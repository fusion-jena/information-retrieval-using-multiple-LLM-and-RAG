To ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model, several measures were implemented during its development. Firstly, the authors utilized a diverse dataset consisting of 14,896 images containing various fish species. This diversity helped prevent overfitting and improved the model's ability to recognize different types of fish accurately. Secondly, data augmentation was employed by multiplying the original dataset by twelve, which further enhanced the model's robustness against variations in input data. Lastly, the authors performed a ground truth validation using data from four fishing sets, comparing it with official sources and estimations. However, there is no explicit mention of specific techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting being applied in this study.
