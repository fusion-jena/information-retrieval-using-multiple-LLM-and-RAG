Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be applied to improve its performance. These may include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing missing values, outliers, and irrelevant data from the dataset. It also includes handling inconsistent data entries.

2. Normalization/Standardization: This step scales numerical input variables so they have zero mean and unit variance. This is important because gradient descent converges much faster with normalized inputs. Common methods include Min-Max Scaling, Z-Score Normalization, and Batch Normalization.

3. Encoding Categorical Variables: Deep learning models cannot handle categorical variables directly. Therefore, these need to be converted into numerical form. Techniques like one-hot encoding, label encoding, and binary encoding can be used.

4. Feature Selection: Not all features contribute equally to predicting the target variable. Some might even degrade the modelâ€™s performance. Hence, it is essential to choose only those features which significantly impact the outcome.

5. Splitting Dataset: Before training the model, the dataset should be split into training set, validation set, and test set. Training set is used to train the model, validation set is used to tune hyperparameters, and test set is used to evaluate the final model.

6. Data Augmentation: To increase the amount of training data, various transformations can be applied to existing images (like rotation, zooming, flipping etc.) to create new ones.

These preprocessing steps help in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the deep learning model. However, the specific steps required depend largely on the nature of the problem being solved and the type of data available.
