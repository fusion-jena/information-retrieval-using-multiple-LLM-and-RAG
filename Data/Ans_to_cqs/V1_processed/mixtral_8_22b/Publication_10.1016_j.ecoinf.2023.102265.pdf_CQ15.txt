Unfortunately, there isn't any explicit mention of specific optimization techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) being applied in the given context. However, based on common practices in deep learning pipelines, these optimization techniques could potentially be employed. For instance, when training the ResNet-50 model mentioned in the text, one might use either SGD or Adam as the optimizer. But without further details, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding which optimization technique was actually utilized in this case.
