The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, we can infer that the model is used for image classification or object detection tasks related to identifying mining activities. This is suggested by phrases such as "the speed at which this approach can classify mining" and "removing the influence of small, misclassified pixels on the reclassification of water bodies." Furthermore, references to using satellite imagery and tools like Google Earth Engine indicate that the model likely processes remote sensing data for these purposes.
