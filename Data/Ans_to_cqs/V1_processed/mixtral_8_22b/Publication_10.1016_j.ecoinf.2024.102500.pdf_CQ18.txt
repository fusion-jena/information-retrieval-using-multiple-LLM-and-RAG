The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of fivefold cross-validation. This means that the dataset is divided into five equal-sized folds. Each fold is then used once as a validation set while the other four folds serve as the training set. This process is repeated five times, ensuring that every data point gets to be in the validation set exactly once. By averaging the coefficient of determination (R2) or root mean square error (RMSE) across these five iterations, a more comprehensive model performance analysis becomes possible. Additionally, hyperparameter tuning is employed to improve the model's predictive capabilities further. This involves selecting the optimal values for various hyperparameters, such as 'n_estimators','max_depth', and'min_samples_split'. The Python library's 'randint' and 'uniform' commands are utilized to pick integer and continuous/discrete values within a specified range for these hyperparameters.
