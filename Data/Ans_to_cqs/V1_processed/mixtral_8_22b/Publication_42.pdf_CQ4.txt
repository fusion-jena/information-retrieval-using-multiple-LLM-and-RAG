The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include flip vertical, flip horizontal, zoom, different illumination intensity, and rotation of different degrees. These operations were performed to provide more training data and create a uniform distribution of species. As a result, the original dataset was scaled with a factor of 32 times, leading to 72,000 images, where each class contained 8000 data points after augmentation.
