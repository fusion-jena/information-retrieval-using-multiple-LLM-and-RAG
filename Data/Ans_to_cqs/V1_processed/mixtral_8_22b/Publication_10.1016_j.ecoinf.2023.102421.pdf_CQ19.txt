The given context does not provide information about any deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch being used to build a deep learning model. Instead, it discusses the use of Bayesian Optimizers and Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT) for tuning the hyperparameters of XGBoost and LightGBM models. These are gradient boosting decision tree algorithms, not deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot determine which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model based on the provided context.
