The article does not provide information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that the authors used convolutional neural networks (CNN) and XGBoost models for their analysis but does not specify any details regarding the availability or location of the code repositories. Therefore, I do not have enough information to determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
