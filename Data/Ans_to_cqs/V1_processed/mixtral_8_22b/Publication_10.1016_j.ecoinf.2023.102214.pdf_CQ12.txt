Unfortunately, the given context does not explicitly mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, there are some clues that suggest the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). For instance, the paper mentions using "data augmentation techniques" such as "left-right mirroring," which are commonly employed when working with image data in CNNs. Additionally, one of the cited papers discusses an "automated vertebrate animals classification using deep convolution neural networks." This further supports the idea that CNNs might be involved in the pipeline. Nevertheless, without explicit confirmation, it cannot be definitively stated that CNNs are the only deep learning model used in the pipeline.
