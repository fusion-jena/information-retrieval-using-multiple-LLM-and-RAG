The given context does not provide explicit information on the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, based on the available information, we can infer that georeferencing and occurrence records of species were used for data collection. Georeferencing involves assigning geographic coordinates to a location or feature, while occurrence records refer to documented instances of a particular species in a specific area. These methods suggest that field observations or surveys may have been employed to gather data on species distributions. Additionally, the use of QGIS software indicates that spatial analysis techniques might have been applied during data processing. Nevertheless, without more specific details, it cannot be confirmed if other methods such as sensors or public datasets were also utilized in this study.
