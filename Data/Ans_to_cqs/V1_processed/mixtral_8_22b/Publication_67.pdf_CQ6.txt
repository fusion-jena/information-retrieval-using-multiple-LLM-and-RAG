The given context does not provide explicit information about specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning applied before training the deep learning model. However, it mentions the use of data augmentation techniques to increase the size of the dataset, which can be considered a form of preprocessing. Data augmentation involves creating modified versions of existing data through operations like rotation, flipping, cropping, etc., to improve the diversity of the dataset and prevent overfitting during training. Additionally, the text refers to configuring model parameters, including setting a learning rate and decay factor, which could also be seen as part of the preparation process before training.
