The research paper titled "A review of deep learning techniques used in agriculture" discusses various deep learning techniques applied in agriculture but does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, another reference, "Estimation of soil organic carbon using Vis-nir spectral data and spectral feature bands selection in southern Xinjiang, China," suggests that spectroscopy is employed for gathering raw data. In this study, a portable visible near-infrared (Vis-NIR) spectrometer was used to collect spectral data from soil samples. The collected data were then processed using different algorithms such as Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR) with Savitzky-Golay smoothing (SG/PLSR) or without smoothing (R/PLSR). Additionally, the paper mentions that data pre-processing was carried out using software like ViewSpecPro and Unscrambler. Therefore, it can be concluded that one method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is through the use of spectrometers.
