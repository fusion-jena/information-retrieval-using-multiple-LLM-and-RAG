The paper does not explicitly discuss specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions using heterogeneous ensemble techniques to combine predictions from multiple models with different algorithms or architectures to improve overall performance and address biases. These techniques include stacking, voting, and weighted average ensembles. Additionally, the authors plan to investigate the scalability and transferability of these ensemble techniques and compare them with deep learning models like CNN and RCNN. While the paper doesn't directly mention stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, these methods could potentially be employed to handle data imbalance and reduce bias in the dataset before applying ensemble techniques or deep learning models.
