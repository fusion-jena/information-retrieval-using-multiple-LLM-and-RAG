The given context does not provide information about specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it discusses the use of automated signal recognition software, specifically Kaleidoscope Pro, for detecting ungulate vocalizations. It mentions a study that achieved a recall rate of 90% for five supervised machine learning algorithms using the Red Deer as a study species. Additionally, the text describes how Kaleidoscope Pro was able to automatically detect 74.5% of cow calls within a validation dataset, which was a significant improvement over previous research using the same software. The context also suggests future directions for improving the accuracy of these algorithms, including the potential use of more sophisticated methods like convolutional neural networks or deep learning.
