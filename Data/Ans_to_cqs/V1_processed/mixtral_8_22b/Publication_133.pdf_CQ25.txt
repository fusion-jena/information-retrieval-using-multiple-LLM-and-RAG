The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is object detection and classification. This can be inferred from several references to the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and specific object detection algorithms like "Faster R-CNN" and YOLO. These techniques are commonly employed for detecting and identifying multiple objects within an image simultaneously. Furthermore, the mention of tables describing recall and precision errors suggests that the model is being evaluated for its ability to accurately identify and categorize different insect species.
