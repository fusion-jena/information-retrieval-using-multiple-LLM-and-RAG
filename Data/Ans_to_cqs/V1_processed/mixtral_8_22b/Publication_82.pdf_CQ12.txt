The study uses two types of deep learning architectures: AlexNet and GoogLeNet. Both models are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). AlexNet was introduced in 2012 and consists of five convolutional layers followed by three fully connected layers. It was one of the first successful applications of CNNs to large-scale image classification tasks. On the other hand, GoogLeNet, also known as Inception v1, was proposed in 2014 and features a more complex design with multiple parallel paths containing different combinations of convolutions, pooling operations, and fully connected layers. This allows the network to capture both local and global patterns within images effectively.
