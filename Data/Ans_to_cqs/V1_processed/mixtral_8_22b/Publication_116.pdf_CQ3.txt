The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data annotation techniques used in computer vision tasks include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. These techniques help provide labeled datasets necessary for supervised machine learning algorithms such as those employed in deep learning models. Without explicit information about the dataset or methodology used in this study, it is impossible to determine which specific technique was utilized.
