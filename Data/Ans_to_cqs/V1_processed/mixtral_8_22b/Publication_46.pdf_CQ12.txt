In the given context, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used as the deep learning model in the pipeline. This type of neural network is specifically designed for processing multidimensional data that follow a grid pattern. The CNN consists of three main layers: convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers. The first two layers are responsible for feature extraction, while the last layer maps these extracted features to the output. In this case, the CNN model was applied to establish both linear and nonlinear relationships between ecological and atmospheric variables to predict the occurrence scenarios of a specific species. The results showed that the CNN model outperformed the traditional BIOCLIM model in terms of accuracy and performance evaluation metrics, such as Area Under Curve (AUC), Kappa, and True Skill Statistics (TSS).
