While the given context does not explicitly mention specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning models, it does suggest that various combinations of epochs and batch sizes were experimented with during the training process. Additionally, it mentions the use of different input resolutions for the images. These factors indicate that some form of preprocessing might have been applied to prepare the dataset for training.

Preprocessing in deep learning typically involves several steps aimed at improving the quality and consistency of the input data. Common preprocessing techniques include:

1. Normalization: Scaling pixel values to a standard range, often between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1, which helps stabilize the learning process by ensuring consistent input scales across different features.

2. Scaling: Resizing images to maintain uniform dimensions, making it easier for the model to learn from them. This step may involve either downscaling larger images or upscaling smaller ones.

3. Cleaning: Removing irrelevant information or noise from the dataset, such as removing unwanted objects or artifacts present in the images.

4. Augmentation: Applying transformations like rotation, flipping, zooming, cropping, or color shifting to generate additional training examples and enhance the robustness of the model.

In the given context, although no explicit details about preprocessing are mentioned, it is reasonable to assume that similar steps might have been employed to ensure the successful training of the YOLOv5 models for alate detection on sorghum leaves.
