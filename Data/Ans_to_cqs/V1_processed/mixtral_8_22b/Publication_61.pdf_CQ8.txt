Unfortunately, there is no information provided about the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the paper. Therefore, I cannot provide the exact link or name of the repository. However, it is common practice for researchers to share their code and datasets publicly, often through platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. You may want to check these platforms or contact the authors directly to request access to the code repository.
