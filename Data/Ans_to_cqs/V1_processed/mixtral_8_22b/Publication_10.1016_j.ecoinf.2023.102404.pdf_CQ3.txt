The given context does not provide specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses various aspects related to remote sensing, machine learning, and deep learning applications. It includes studies on topics such as Google Earth Engine for big data applications, estimating shrub willow biomass from UAS imagery, comparing decision tree-based models for forest above-ground biomass estimation, neural networks for mapping canopy height, and a meta-analysis of deep learning in remote sensing applications.

In general, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and image classification. These techniques help label datasets for tasks like object detection, image segmentation, or image classification. However, without explicit mention in the provided context, I cannot confirm which specific data annotation techniques were employed in these studies.
