Based on the given information, it does not provide details about the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot accurately determine whether they use image, audio, video, or CSV files for their analysis. However, considering the nature of the research involving specimen categorization and environmental factors, it can be assumed that they might have used structured datasets like CSV or Excel files containing relevant information about each specimen and its corresponding environment. Additionally, satellite imagery could also potentially be utilized to extract topographical features. Nevertheless, without explicit mention of the data format, this remains purely speculative.
