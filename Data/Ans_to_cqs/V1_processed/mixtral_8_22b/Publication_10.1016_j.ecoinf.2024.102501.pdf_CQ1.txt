Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer from the information provided that various types of data might have been collected for this study.

For instance, the paper mentions considering parameters such as temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure in the air as input variables for their model. This suggests that they may have used sensors or other devices to collect these environmental data points. Additionally, since the study focuses on predicting dissolved oxygen concentrations in water, it is likely that water samples were taken and analyzed to gather relevant data.

Moreover, the context refers to a dataset listed in Table 1, which could indicate that publicly available datasets were also used in the study. It is common practice in many scientific fields to utilize existing datasets alongside original data collection efforts.

Lastly, while the context does not directly state the use of surveys, it cannot be ruled out entirely. Surveys can provide valuable insights into human activities affecting water bodies, which could influence dissolved oxygen levels indirectly.

To summarize, although the exact methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline are not specified in the provided context, it is reasonable to assume that a combination of sensor measurements, water sample analysis, publicly available datasets, and possibly even survey responses were employed.
