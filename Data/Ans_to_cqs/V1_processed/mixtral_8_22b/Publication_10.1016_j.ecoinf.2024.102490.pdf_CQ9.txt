The georeferenced coordinates of Campomanesia guazumifolia, C. xanthocarpa, Eugenia pyriformis, and Psidium cattleyanum are obtained from various databases such as SpeciesLink, Reflora-Virtual Herbarium, and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) system. However, there is no explicit mention of a specific data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in this study. Therefore, it cannot be determined where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available based on the given context.
