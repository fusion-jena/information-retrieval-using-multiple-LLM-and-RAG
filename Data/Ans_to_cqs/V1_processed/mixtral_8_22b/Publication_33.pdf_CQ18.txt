The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves two phases. In the first phase, a classification model is built by training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on a given database T0. Once the initial model is trained, the second phase begins, which focuses on tuning a risk threshold specific to each class (species in this case) using a second and independent database called T1. This process allows for adjustments to ensure optimal performance and accuracy when dealing with large datasets containing unidentified species.
