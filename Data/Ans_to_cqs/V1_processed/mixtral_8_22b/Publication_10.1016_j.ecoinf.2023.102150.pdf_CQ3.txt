The papers mentioned in the given context discuss various aspects related to deep learning and its applications in wildlife monitoring and conservation. However, they do not explicitly mention specific data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Nevertheless, some relevant information regarding data annotation can still be extracted from these sources.

For instance, Norouzzadeh et al. (2021) describe their work on developing a deep learning system for animal identification in camera trap images. Although they do not specifically state the type of data annotation technique employed, it can be assumed that some form of object detection or semantic segmentation was utilized to identify animals within the images. Similarly, Mos & Hofmeester (2020) present their research on designing a specialized camera trap called the 'Mostela,' intended for studying small mustelids. While no explicit reference is made to any particular data annotation methods, it is reasonable to infer that similar techniques were applied to train their deep learning models.

Moreover, Kellenberger et al. (2020) introduce AIDE (Annotation Interface for Data-driven Ecology), an open-source web framework designed for image annotation and machine learning model training. This platform supports both manual and automated annotations, suggesting that multiple data annotation techniques could potentially be implemented through this software.

Lastly, the review paper by Young et al. (2018) mentions several software tools developed for managing camera trap data and facilitating image annotation processes. Some of these tools may incorporate features supporting different types of data annotation techniques like bounding boxes or polygonal masks.

In conclusion, while none of the cited works directly address the specific data annotation techniques used in their respective deep learning pipelines, there are indications that various approaches such as object detection, semantic segmentation, and possibly others might have been employed based on the nature of their studies.
