Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no explicit information about which specific frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch were used to build the deep learning models mentioned in this study. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the use of these particular frameworks. However, considering that the authors compared their results with those obtained using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), it could be inferred that they might have employed one of the popular deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch, as these libraries support various optimization algorithms including SGD. Nonetheless, further clarification would require additional information or resources beyond what is currently available.
