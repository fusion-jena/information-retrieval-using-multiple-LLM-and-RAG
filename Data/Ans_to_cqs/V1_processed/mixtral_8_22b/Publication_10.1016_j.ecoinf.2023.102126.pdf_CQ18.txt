Based on the given information, there isn't any direct mention or discussion about monitoring the model performance during training. However, it does discuss the process of analyzing and visualizing the results of the FAIR assessment of datasets using the F-UJI tool. After running the F-UJI tool, the results are processed through a computational notebook report, resulting in visualizations of the summaries of each FAIR principle for all eight repositories. These visualizations include histogram plots of the results, showing each principle and the overall FAIR score. Therefore, while there may not be explicit details regarding the strategy for monitoring the model performance during training, the process involves collecting total scores for the FAIR metric within a data frame and then visualizing these metrics to summarise the evaluations.
