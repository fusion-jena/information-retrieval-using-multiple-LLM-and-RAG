Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization being used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, the text does indicate that data augmentation was employed to address the issue of overfitting due to insufficient training data. Data augmentation is a common technique used to increase the amount of available training data by applying various transformations to existing images, thereby creating new variations of the original data. This helps improve the generalizability of the model and reduces the risk of overfitting. While data augmentation is mentioned as a method to combat overfitting, it should be noted that other regularization techniques like dropout or L2 regularization could also have been applied but were not explicitly stated in the provided context.
