The authors used heterogeneous ensemble techniques to optimize the performance of five base learners and mitigate potential overfitting. They combined predictions from multiple models with different underlying algorithms or architectures. This approach helps to address biases and improve the effectiveness of models. However, the specific methods used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, are not explicitly mentioned in the given context. Therefore, it cannot be determined which specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model based on the provided information.
