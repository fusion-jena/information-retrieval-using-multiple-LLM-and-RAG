Unfortunately, based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware resources were utilized during the training process. It would be best to refer back to the original source material or consult with the authors/researchers involved in developing this model for more accurate details about their chosen hardware setup.
