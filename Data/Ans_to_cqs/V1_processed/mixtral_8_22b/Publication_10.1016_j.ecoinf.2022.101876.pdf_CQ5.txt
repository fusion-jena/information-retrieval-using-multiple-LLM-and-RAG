The text does not provide specific details about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that MegaDetector, a state-of-the-art computer vision network based on Faster R-CNN, was trained using hundreds of thousands of images labeled by manual human review from a wide variety of ecosystems. These images were classified as either an animal (any non-human animal), human (any person), or truck (any vehicle). Therefore, while the exact dataset names are not mentioned, it can be inferred that the training dataset consisted of diverse wildlife camera trap images containing animals, humans, and vehicles.
