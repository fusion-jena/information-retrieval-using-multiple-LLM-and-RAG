Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available from the given context to provide a specific answer regarding the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, based on common practices in machine learning projects, some possible postprocessing steps might include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., creating confusion matrices, and visualizing results through graphs and charts. These steps help evaluate the performance of the trained models and gain insights into areas where they may need improvement.
