The performance of the deep learning model, specifically the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), is evaluated using several metrics. The primary metric mentioned in the provided context is the Area Under Curve (AUC) evaluation metrics. The AUC value for the CNN model was found to be 0.917, while it was 0.68 for the BIOCLIM model. This indicates the superiority of the CNN model for species distribution compared to the BIOCLIM model.

Additionally, the Kappa statistic is used to measure the agreement between predicted and observed values, resulting in values of 0.94 for the CNN model and 0.76 for the BIOCLIM model. Another metric used is True Skill Statistics (TSS), with a value of 0.652 for the CNN model and 0.44 for the BIOCLIM model. These values further demonstrate the superiority of deep learning models like CNN for species probability distribution using the given set of ecological and bioclimatic parameters.
