Based on the given information, it is not possible to determine the exact process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, some common steps involved in deploying a deep learning model include model serialization, platform selection, and integration into existing systems or applications. Model serialization involves saving the trained model parameters and architecture in a file format such as.h5 or.pkl, so that they can be loaded later for making predictions. Platform selection involves choosing a suitable environment for running the deployed model, such as cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure, or local servers. Integration into existing systems or applications may involve writing custom code to call the model and handle its input/output, or using pre-built libraries or APIs. Without more specific details about the deployment process used in this study, it is not possible to provide a more detailed answer.
