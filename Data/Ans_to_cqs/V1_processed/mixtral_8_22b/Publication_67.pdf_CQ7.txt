The text does not provide explicit information about how the data was split into training, testing, and validation sets. However, it can be inferred that five different datasets were created during the database construction phase, which included examples of images with different levels of tree cover, continuous and discrete approximations, and the inclusion of an auxiliary class called "Non-Forest." It is also mentioned that these datasets were used to train five CNN models based on Inception v.3 using two optimization techniques, transfer learning, and data augmentation. Therefore, it can be assumed that one or more of these datasets served as the training set for the models. Additionally, the text mentions that the performance of the CNN-based models was assessed on new images, suggesting that there may have been a separate test or validation set used for evaluation purposes. However, without further details, it cannot be determined exactly how the data was divided among the various subsets.
