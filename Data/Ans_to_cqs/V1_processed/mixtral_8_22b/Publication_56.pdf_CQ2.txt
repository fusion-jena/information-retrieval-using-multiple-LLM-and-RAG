Based on the given context, it appears that the primary focus is on the application of deep learning techniques to analyze remote sensing (RS) data. While specific details regarding the exact format of this data are not explicitly mentioned, it can be inferred that the data primarily consists of images due to the nature of remote sensing. Remote sensing involves capturing images of the earth's surface from various platforms like satellites, aircraft, etc. These images may include multispectral or hyperspectral data, which provide detailed information about the physical characteristics of the observed objects.

Moreover, the context mentions the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for processing this data. CNNs are particularly effective in handling image data, while RNNs are often used for sequential data, including time series data. Given these points, it can be concluded that the data used in this deep learning pipeline is predominantly in the form of images, potentially accompanied by other related metadata. However, without more explicit information, it cannot be definitively stated whether additional data formats like audio, video, or CSV files are included in the pipeline.
