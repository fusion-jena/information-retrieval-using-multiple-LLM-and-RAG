I apologize, but based on the given context, there is no information about any specific optimization techniques being applied in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate response to your query.

Based on the provided context, we can discuss the findings related to the comparison of different methods for correcting sampling bias effects in species distribution modeling. However, there is no mention of any optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline.

In the context provided, various methods like Fenv, BGenv, and Fgeo were compared using different performance indices such as ΔDenv, ΔDgeo, and ΔAUC. The ranking of these methods varied depending on the correction type and the number of presence sites. For instance, when the number of presence sites was 20, Fenv was the best method concerning ΔDenv, followed by BGenv. On the other hand, when the number of presence sites increased, BGgeo was ranked the best in terms of ΔAUC, while BGgeo and Fenv were the best in terms of ΔDenv and ΔDgeo respectively.

However, none of the mentioned methods seem to be consistently superior across all scenarios, making it difficult to identify a single best approach. Additionally, the chosen parameterization for the correction methods was deemed appropriate due to its ability to achieve a good compromise between unbiased models and corrected ones.

Overall, the discussion focuses on comparing different methods for correcting sampling bias effects in species distribution modeling rather than discussing optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline.
