Based on the given context, the study uses the 'Full-archive search endpoint' to access the entire dataset published on Twitter from its beginning in 2006-2007 until the end of 2022. The API works by searching for words, hashtags, or combinations of both in the text of tweets. Three different criteria were used to perform the tweet search through the API: (i) tweets in which users ask "who knows" or if "anyone knows" what they have found, (ii) tweets that directly ask "what is this" that they have found, and (iii) tweets from users claiming to have found something, with textual expression as "I/we have found". However, the context does not provide any explicit mention of data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. These techniques are typically associated with image or video datasets rather than textual data like tweets. Therefore, based on the given context, I do not know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for this study.
