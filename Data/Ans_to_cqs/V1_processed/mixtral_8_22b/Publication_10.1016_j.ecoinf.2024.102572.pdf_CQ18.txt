Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide a helpful response regarding the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, some common strategies include tracking metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or loss function values; visualizing learning curves; and performing cross-validation. These methods can help identify issues like underfitting, overfitting, or convergence problems during the training process.
