Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about specific data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, the text does mention that the model training involves processing data with a deep neural network to output a classifier for prediction. This suggests that some form of labeled data is likely being used during the training phase. Additionally, the discussion of the results mentions the segmentation of a point cloud test set and obtaining final segmentation results, indicating that semantic segmentation may be one of the tasks performed in this pipeline. It should also be noted that the references section includes papers related to classification and segmentation tasks, further supporting this interpretation. Without more detailed information about the specific dataset and preprocessing steps involved, it is not possible to definitively state what data annotation techniques were used.
