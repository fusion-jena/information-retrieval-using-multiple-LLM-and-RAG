According to the given context, the hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a grid search method. Grid search is a technique where we define a set of values for each parameter and exhaustively consider every combination of these parameters to find the best one. This method can be computationally expensive but it ensures that the optimal solution will not be missed. However, the context does not provide any information about other methods such as random search or Bayesian optimization being used for hyperparameter tuning.
