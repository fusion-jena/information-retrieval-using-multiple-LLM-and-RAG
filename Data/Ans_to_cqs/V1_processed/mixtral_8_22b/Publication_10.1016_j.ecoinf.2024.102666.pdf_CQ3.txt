The given context does not provide specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge, some common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and image labeling. These techniques help in creating labeled datasets required for training machine learning models.

Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects in an image and assigning them labels. Semantic segmentation involves classifying each pixel in an image into one of several predefined categories. Instance segmentation is similar to semantic segmentation but also differentiates between individual instances of the same category. Polygon annotation involves outlining the shape of objects in an image using polygons. Key point annotation involves marking specific points or landmarks on objects in an image. Image labeling involves assigning a label or tag to an entire image.

In the context of satellite imagery analysis, object detection and semantic segmentation are commonly used techniques. Object detection can be used to identify and locate specific features such as buildings, roads, or vehicles within an image. Semantic segmentation can be used to classify pixels into different land cover types such as vegetation, water bodies, or urban areas.
