Based on the provided context, it appears that the text discusses a statistical modeling approach rather than a deep learning model. Therefore, there is no mention of specific hyperparameters typically associated with deep learning models such as learning rates or optimizers. Instead, the context refers to two tuning parameters, τ and ϕ, used in the penalized loss function with an L1 penalty. These parameters play a role similar to regularization hyperparameters in machine learning models, controlling the strength of the penalty applied during optimization. Additionally, the Root Trimmed Mean Squared Prediction Error (RTMSPE) is utilized to select appropriate values for these tuning parameters. However, without further information about the underlying model architecture or training process, it is not possible to provide more specific details regarding any potential hyperparameters related to this context.
