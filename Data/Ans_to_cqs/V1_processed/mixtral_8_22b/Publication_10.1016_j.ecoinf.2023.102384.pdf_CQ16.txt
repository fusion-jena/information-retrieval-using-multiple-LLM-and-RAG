The text does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, it mentions that there is a separate validation phase where the performance of the trained model is evaluated. This suggests that the completion of training might be determined by monitoring the performance of the model on the validation set. Common practices include stopping the training when the validation loss or error stops improving significantly (validation loss plateau). Additionally, early stopping can also be applied to prevent overfitting, which involves halting the training if the validation loss starts increasing while the training loss continues decreasing. Nevertheless, without further details, it cannot be confirmed what exact criteria are used to decide when the training should stop.
