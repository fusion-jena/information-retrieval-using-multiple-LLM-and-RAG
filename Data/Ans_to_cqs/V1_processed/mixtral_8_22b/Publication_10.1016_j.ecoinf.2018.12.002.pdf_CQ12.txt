The given context does not provide information about the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it mentions several machine learning algorithms such as neural networks, CARTs, linear discriminant analysis, random forests, and support vector machines. These are traditional machine learning models rather than deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot determine which type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline.
