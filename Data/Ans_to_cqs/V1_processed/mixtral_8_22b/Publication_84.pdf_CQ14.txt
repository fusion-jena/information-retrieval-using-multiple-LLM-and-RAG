In this study, the hyperparameters of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model were optimized using a sensitivity analysis method described by Heydari and Mountrakis (2018). Specifically, they used a grid search approach to find the best combination of parameters for their model. They tested different values for two main parameters: 'gamma' and 'cost'. For 'gamma', they tried values ranging from 0.01 to 300, while for 'cost', they tested values from 0.1 to 50. To evaluate each combination of parameters, they selected 50% of the reference data for parameter optimization. Finally, they chose the combination of 'gamma' and 'cost' that resulted in the highest overall accuracy. However, it is not explicitly mentioned how the hyperparameters of other models like Stacked Autoencoder (SAE) or deep learning with Ppf-CM were optimized.
