The text does not provide specific information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. It discusses the methodology used for training the model, including the dataset preparation, preprocessing steps, and the division of data into training and validation sets. However, it does not mention any details regarding the deployment process such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, without additional context, it is not possible to determine what process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
