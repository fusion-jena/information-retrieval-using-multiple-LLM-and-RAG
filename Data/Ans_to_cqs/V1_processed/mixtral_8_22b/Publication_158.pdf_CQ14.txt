The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a combination of random search and grid search methods. Initially, a random search is performed to identify an optimal parameter set, where 100 sets are sampled and compared using three-fold cross validation. The parameter ranges for this random search include the number of trees (200 to 800, by 100), minimum samples split (2--4), minimum samples per leaf (2--4), maximum depth (full), bootstrap (true), and maximum features for split (square root of the number of features). After identifying an optimal parameter set through the random search, a grid-search is then employed to refine these results further. The parameter ranges for the grid-search are set to ±50 for the number of estimators and ±1 for the other parameters. This optimization process helps ensure that the best possible hyperparameters are selected for the given dataset and problem statement.
