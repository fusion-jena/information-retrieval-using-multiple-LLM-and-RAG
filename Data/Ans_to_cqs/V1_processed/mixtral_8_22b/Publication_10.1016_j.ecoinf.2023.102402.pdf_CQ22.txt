The performance of the deep learning model was evaluated using two main metrics: the Area Under the receiver-operator Curve (AUC) and the True Skill Statistics (TSS). The AUC values range from 0 to 1, where values closer to 1 indicate a higher accuracy of model prediction. On the other hand, the TSS values range between -1 and +1. A TSS value of +1 means complete agreement between observed and predicted distributions, whereas values of ≤0 denote no better than random performance. These two metrics are commonly used to assess the model performance in species distribution model studies. Additionally, the Akaike Information Criterion corrected for small sample sizes (AICc) was used to select the best model among different candidate models based on goodness-of-fit and complexity. The model with the lowest AICc value is considered the best model, while all models with ΔAICc <2 are generally considered to have substantial support.
