The given context does not provide information about the specific deep learning frameworks used to build the model. However, it mentions the use of machine learning methods and specifically discusses the Enhanced Representation through Knowledge Integration (ERNIE) model. While the context does not explicitly state whether TensorFlow or PyTorch were used, these are popular deep learning frameworks that could have been utilized. Without further context, it cannot be definitively stated which framework was used to build the deep learning model.
