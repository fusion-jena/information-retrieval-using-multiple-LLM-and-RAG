Based on the given context, it appears that there is no explicit mention of specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. However, Figure 2 does showcase some form of data augmentation being applied to the Acridotheres cristatellus sound. Unfortunately, without further details, I cannot provide a precise list of the data augmentation techniques employed in their study. Nevertheless, it can be inferred that they did utilize some form of data augmentation methods to enhance their dataset.
