Based on the given information, there isn't any explicit mention of specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the authors have utilized their own custom dataset consisting of ecological images related to their research topic. They also mentioned using a 'prior synthetic dataset', but no further details about this dataset were provided. Therefore, without additional context, I cannot provide a definitive list of datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
