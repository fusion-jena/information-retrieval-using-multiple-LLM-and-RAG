The deep learning model mentioned in this context is called BirdNET, which is used for avian diversity monitoring. According to the paper by Kahl et al. (2021), BirdNET is designed to perform bird species recognition using audio recordings. Therefore, its primary purpose is classification - specifically, identifying the species of birds present in a given recording. This is further supported by the fact that it has been evaluated based on classification performance in several studies, including those by Swaminathan et al. (2024) and McGinn et al. (2023).
