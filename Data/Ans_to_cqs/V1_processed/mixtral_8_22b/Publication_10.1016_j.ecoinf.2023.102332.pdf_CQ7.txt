Unfortunately, there isn't any explicit information about how the data was split for deep learning model training (train, test, validation) in the given context. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to use a portion of the available data for training the model, another portion for validating the model during training, and a third portion for testing the model after training. A typical split might be 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. But this can vary depending on the specific requirements and constraints of each project. In some cases, techniques like k-fold cross-validation may also be employed.
