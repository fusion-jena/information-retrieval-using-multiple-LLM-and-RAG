The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that some form of image labeling or classification was performed due to the mention of various datasets containing different types of rice diseases. Additionally, the use of deep learning-based segmentation mentioned in one of the studies suggests that instance segmentation might have been applied. Instance segmentation involves outlining each object of interest within an image, allowing the model to identify individual instances of objects rather than treating them as part of a larger group. Nevertheless, without more detailed information on the exact steps taken during the data preparation phase, it cannot be definitively stated what specific data annotation techniques were used.
