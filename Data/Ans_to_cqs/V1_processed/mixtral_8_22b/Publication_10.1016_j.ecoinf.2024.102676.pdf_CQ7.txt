The information provided does not explicitly state the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, or validation sets. However, it is common practice in machine learning to use a portion of the dataset for training the model, another portion for validating its performance during the training process, and a final portion for testing the model after training. This helps prevent overfitting and ensures the model can generalize well to new, unseen data. Typically, the dataset is randomly divided into these subsets, often using an 80/20 or 70/30 split for training and testing, respectively, while reserving a smaller subset for validation. Without specific details about the splitting criteria used in this case, I cannot provide a more precise answer.
