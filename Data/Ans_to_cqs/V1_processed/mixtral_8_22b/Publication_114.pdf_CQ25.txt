The purpose of the deep learning model in this case is for image classification. Specifically, the authors aim to classify 18 different types of tree species using various Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures such as AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet50. These networks were originally developed for general image classification tasks but have since been applied to remote sensing applications like tree species identification. The goal is to accurately distinguish between different tree species by analyzing their visual characteristics captured in images. This task is framed as a supervised image classification problem where the model learns to predict the correct label for each input image based on labeled training data.
