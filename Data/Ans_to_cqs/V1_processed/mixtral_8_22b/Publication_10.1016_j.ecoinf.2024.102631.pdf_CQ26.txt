The text does not provide specific details about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, common techniques used to handle data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets based on certain criteria, such as class labels, ensuring each subset maintains the original distribution of classes. Oversampling increases the representation of minority classes by duplicating samples, while undersampling reduces the majority class size by removing samples. Lastly, diverse data collection aims to gather more representative datasets by including samples from different sources, demographics, or conditions. These techniques can help mitigate data bias and improve the overall performance of deep learning models.
