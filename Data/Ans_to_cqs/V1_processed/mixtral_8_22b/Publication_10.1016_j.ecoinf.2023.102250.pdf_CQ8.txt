The paper does not provide information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions the datasets used, such as MobileNetV2, ResNet18, VGG16, Ori G1\_Dataset1, G1\_Dataset2, etc., but it does not mention any specific code repository or platform like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information based on the given context.
