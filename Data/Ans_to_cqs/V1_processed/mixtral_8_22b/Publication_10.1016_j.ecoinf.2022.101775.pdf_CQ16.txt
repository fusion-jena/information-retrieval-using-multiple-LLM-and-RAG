The text does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, it can be inferred that the training duration is predetermined based on the statement "trained the algorithm during 100 epochs." Additionally, the use of a validation set suggests that monitoring validation performance might have been employed to ensure the model did not overfit during training. Therefore, while there isn't explicit information about the exact stopping criterion, one could infer that the model was trained for a fixed number of epochs (100) and possibly monitored for overfitting using the validation set.
