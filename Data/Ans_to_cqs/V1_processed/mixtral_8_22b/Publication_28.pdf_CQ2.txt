The materials and methods section does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the context that the data format used is likely to be images, specifically satellite images. This is because the text discusses the application of Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in assigning proper class labels to satellite images during the classification process. Both VAE and CNN are commonly used for processing image data. Therefore, it can be concluded that the data format used in this deep learning pipeline is most likely image data, specifically satellite images.
