The pipeline uses various types of deep learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Specifically, it employs DenseNet201, efficientNetB0, efficientNetB3, Inceptionresnetv2, and ResNet50v2. These models are part of the ensemble methods used in the pipeline. Additionally, the pipeline utilizes EfficientNet, which is a CNN architecture and scaling method that uniformly scales all dimensions of the CNN. It includes networks such as EfficientNetB0 and EfficientNetB3. Another model used is InceptionResNetv2, which is a CNN network built upon the inception family of architectures but incorporating residual connections instead of the filter concatenation stage of the inception family. Lastly, the pipeline uses ResNet50v2, a deep learning architecture that is 50 layers deep and trained on a million images from the ImageNet dataset.
