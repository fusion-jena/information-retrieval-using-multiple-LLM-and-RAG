The text does not provide explicit information on the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it mentions that a significant amount of training data including the Near Infrared (NIR) band along with Red Green Blue (RGB) color images were used. Additionally, large batch sizes greater than 16 were employed during training due to the recommendation for efficient model training in DeepLabV3+. Furthermore, the DeepLabV3+ architecture, initially designed for three input channels (RGB), had to be modified to accommodate four-channel input images (RGB + NIR). This suggests that efforts were made to incorporate diverse datasets into the training process. Nevertheless, without further details, it remains unclear whether techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting were utilized to enhance the model's generalizability.
