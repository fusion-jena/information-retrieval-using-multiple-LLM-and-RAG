The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it can be inferred that some form of data preprocessing was likely performed given the nature of the research involving remote sensing and deep learning methodologies.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same proportions of classes within both sets. This technique ensures that the classifier has been trained on a representative sample of all possible classes.

Oversampling and undersampling involve adjusting the balance between majority and minority classes in order to improve classification performance. In oversampling, additional instances of the minority class are added to the dataset, whereas in undersampling, instances of the majority class are removed.

Diverse data collection refers to collecting a wide variety of samples representing various conditions and scenarios in order to ensure that the resulting model generalizes well across different situations.

While these techniques were not specifically mentioned in the provided context, they may still have been employed during the preprocessing stage of the deep learning pipeline. It is important to note that addressing data bias is crucial in ensuring accurate and reliable results when applying deep learning algorithms to real-world problems.
