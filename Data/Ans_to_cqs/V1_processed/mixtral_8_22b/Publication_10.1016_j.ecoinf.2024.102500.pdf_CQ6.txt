The text does not provide explicit information about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it mentions several common preprocessing steps typically applied when working with machine learning models, including those based on deep learning architectures.

Preprocessing steps can include various operations aimed at preparing the dataset for modeling, such as handling missing values, outliers, and noisy data. Normalization and scaling are also frequently employed to ensure that all features have similar scales, preventing any feature from dominating others due to differences in magnitudes. Common normalization techniques include Min-Max scaling, Z-score standardization, and unit norm scaling.

Data cleaning involves identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies within datasets. This step may involve removing duplicates, dealing with missing values through imputation or deletion, and addressing outliers.

Additionally, encoding categorical variables into numerical representations might be necessary if the deep learning model requires numeric input. Techniques like label encoding, one-hot encoding, or ordinal encoding could be utilized depending on the nature of the categorical variable.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps for deep learning models, typical preprocessing tasks often include handling missing values, normalization/scaling, data cleaning, and encoding categorical variables.
