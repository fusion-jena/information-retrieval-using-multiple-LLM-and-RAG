The performance and accuracy of each model are evaluated and compared using two main metrics: AUC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve) and TSS (True Skill Statistic). The true skill statistics value ranges between -1 and +1, where positive values indicate a perfect fit. On the other hand, AUC values range from 0.5 to 1, with higher values indicating better accuracy and predictive power. These metrics help assess how well the models perform in predicting the desired outcomes based on the input data.
