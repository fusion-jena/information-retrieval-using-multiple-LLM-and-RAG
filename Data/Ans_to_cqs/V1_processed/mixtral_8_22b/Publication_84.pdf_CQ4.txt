The given context does not provide information about specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, or scaling used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the study investigates the application of phenological knowledge as input data for deep learning to improve the performance in detecting invasive Spartina alterniflora. It also discusses using Google Earth Engine (GEE), a powerful platform for handling large amounts of data, and employing a deep learning classifier. Unfortunately, there is no mention of any particular data augmentation techniques used within their deep learning pipeline.
