The given text does not provide specific details about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that due to the complexity and computational requirements of deep learning algorithms, powerful hardware resources such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) would typically be employed for efficient training. These specialized processors enable parallel processing, allowing for faster computation and handling of large datasets required for deep learning tasks.
