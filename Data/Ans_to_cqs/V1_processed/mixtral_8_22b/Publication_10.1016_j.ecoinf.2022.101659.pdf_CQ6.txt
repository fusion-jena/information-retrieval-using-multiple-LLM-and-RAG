Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be taken to ensure optimal performance. These include:

1. Normalization or standardization: This involves transforming the data so that it has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. This helps to prevent any single feature from dominating the others due to its scale.

2. Scaling: Similar to normalization, scaling involves adjusting the range of features to a common scale without distorting differences in the ranges of values or losing information.

3. Cleaning: Data cleaning involves removing or correcting errors, missing values, and inconsistencies in the dataset. This step ensures that the model does not learn incorrect patterns from noisy or erroneous data.

4. Feature selection/extraction: Selecting relevant features or extracting new ones can help reduce dimensionality and improve model performance. Techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can be used for feature extraction.

5. Splitting the dataset: The dataset is typically split into three subsets - training set, validation set, and test set. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters, and the test set is used to evaluate the final model performance.

Based on the given context, we can see that the authors have performed some preprocessing steps before conducting their analysis. They mention using 1 Hz sampling frequency and averaging the gaping data over 5 minutes for the Venice Lagoon and 1 minute for the Wadden Sea. They also state that they used daily curves of gaping as input in their analysis. However, specific details regarding other preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
