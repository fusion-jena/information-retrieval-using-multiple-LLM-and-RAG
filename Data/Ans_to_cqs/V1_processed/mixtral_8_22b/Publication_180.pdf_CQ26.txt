The text does not provide information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that a crucial advantage of using TensorFlow was eliminating the need for preprocessing images for their identification system. This suggests that they did not employ any preprocessing techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Instead, they directly compared TensorFlow's classification performance based on cleaned and raw images.

Based on general knowledge, there are several techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline:

1. Stratified Splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes in both sets. It helps prevent overfitting and ensures that the model learns from all classes equally.

2. Oversampling: In cases where one class has significantly fewer samples than others, oversampling can be employed to create synthetic examples of the minority class. This balances the dataset and improves the model's ability to learn from underrepresented classes.

3. Undersampling: Contrary to oversampling, undersampling reduces the size of the majority class to match the minority class. While this may lead to loss of valuable information, it can help improve the overall performance of the model.

4. Diverse Data Collection: Collecting more diverse data can also help mitigate data bias. By gathering data from multiple sources, demographics, or environments, the model becomes better equipped to handle real-world scenarios and reduce biases introduced by limited datasets.
