Based on the given context, it appears that the study utilizes Multispectral LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data for training a Deep Learning (DL) model. However, the specific methods or tools used for collecting the raw data are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.

In general, LiDAR data can be collected using airborne or terrestrial LiDAR systems. Airborne LiDAR involves mounting the system on an aircraft or drone, while terrestrial LiDAR requires placing the sensor on the ground. Both methods involve emitting laser pulses towards the target area and measuring the time it takes for the pulse to return after reflection, which allows for accurate distance measurements.

As for the spectral reflectance values mentioned in the context, they could potentially be obtained through hyperspectral imaging techniques. Hyperspectral cameras capture images across numerous narrow bands of the electromagnetic spectrum, providing detailed information about the materials being imaged.

However, without more specific details regarding the data collection process in this particular study, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer. It would be necessary to refer to additional sources or consult the original research paper for more precise information.
