The tables provided do not directly discuss the evaluation metrics for a deep learning model but rather present the evaluation indices for object-oriented nearest neighbor and random forest classifications. However, based on these tables, we can infer some commonly used evaluation metrics for assessing the performance of such models.

For both the nearest neighbor and random forest classifications, two main metrics are presented: Producer Accuracy and User Accuracy. These metrics are also known as Precision and Recall, respectively, in machine learning terminology. Additionally, Overall Accuracy is mentioned, which could be considered equivalent to the Accuracy metric in machine learning. The Kappa statistic is another measure used to evaluate the agreement between predicted and actual classes, considering the possibility of chance agreements.

To summarize, the following metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the object-oriented nearest neighbor and random forest classifications:

1. Producer Accuracy/Precision: This measures how many true positives were correctly identified out of all positive predictions made by the model. It helps determine the reliability of the model's positive predictions.
2. User Accuracy/Recall: This measures how many true positives were correctly identified out of all actual positive instances. It indicates the model's ability to find all relevant instances.
3. Overall Accuracy/Accuracy: This measures the proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions made by the model. It provides a general idea of the model's performance.
4. Kappa Statistic: This measures the agreement between predicted and actual classes while accounting for the possibility of chance agreements. A higher value indicates better agreement.
