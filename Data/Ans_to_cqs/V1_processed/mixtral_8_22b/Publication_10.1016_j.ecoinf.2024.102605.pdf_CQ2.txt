The papers cited do not provide explicit information about the specific data formats used in their respective deep learning pipelines. However, we can infer from the titles and abstracts that some of them use images or hyperspectral data. For example, Patil and Kumar (2016) analyze plant leaf diseases using color, shape, and texture features, which suggests they work with image data. Similarly, Qiyou et al. (2021) identify strawberry leaf diseases using hyperspectral imaging, indicating they also work with image data. Other studies like Pavanelli and Loch (2018) and Pisek et al. (2015) focus on remote sensing applications, suggesting they might be working with satellite or drone-generated image data. Lastly, Lira et al. (2010) mention infrared spectroscopy, implying they may be dealing with spectral data. Therefore, it is safe to assume that these studies primarily utilize image or spectral data formats in their deep learning pipelines.
