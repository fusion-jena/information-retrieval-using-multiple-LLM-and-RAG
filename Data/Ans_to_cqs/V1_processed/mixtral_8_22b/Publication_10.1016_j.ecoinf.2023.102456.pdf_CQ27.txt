Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available in the given context to provide a detailed response about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, based on common practices in machine learning projects, after training a deep learning model, one would typically follow these steps:

1. Model Serialization: Save the trained model parameters into a file or database so they can be loaded later without retraining the model. This is often done using libraries specific to the programming language used, such as pickle in Python or joblib.

2. Platform Selection: Choose where to host the deployed model. This decision depends on various factors, including the size of the dataset, computational resources required, latency requirements, and budget constraints. Some popular platforms include cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, or local servers.

3. Deployment: Once the platform is selected, the serialized model needs to be uploaded onto the chosen platform. Depending on the platform, this step may involve setting up virtual machines, containers, or serverless functions.

4. API Creation: Create an application programming interface (API) to allow users or applications to access the predictions made by the deployed model. APIs are usually created using web frameworks like Flask or FastAPI in Python.

5. Testing: After deployment, thoroughly test the entire pipeline to ensure everything works correctly and efficiently. This includes testing the accuracy of the model's predictions, checking the performance under load, and verifying security measures.
