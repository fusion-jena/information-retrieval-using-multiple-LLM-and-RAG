The pipeline uses a modified version of the Xception network, which is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This network has been adapted with a positional attention mechanism to improve its effectiveness in bird recognition tasks. The Xception network outperforms other CNN architectures like Resnet and DenseNet due to its deep separable convolutional (DSC) structure. Additionally, it offers faster training and inference speeds compared to vision transformers.
