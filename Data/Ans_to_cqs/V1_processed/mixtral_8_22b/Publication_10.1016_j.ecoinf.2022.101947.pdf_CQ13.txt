The text does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. It only mentions that the FIT pairwise comparison model was used for generating a classification dendrogram with 100% accuracy. To find out more about the hyperparameters used in this study, one would need access to additional resources or contact the authors directly.

Based on the given context, it is not possible to determine the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
