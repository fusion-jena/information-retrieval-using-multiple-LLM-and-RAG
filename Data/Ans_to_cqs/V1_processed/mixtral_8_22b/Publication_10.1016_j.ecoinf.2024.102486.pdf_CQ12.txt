The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, we can infer some possibilities based on the mentioned tools and applications.

For instance, the text mentions the use of the Deep Learning Toolbox by MathWorks, cuDNN, and Darknet. These tools support various types of deep learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and others.

Moreover, the context refers to typical machine learning applications involving recognition and classification of visual images or acoustic recordings. CNNs are commonly used for image recognition tasks due to their ability to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features. On the other hand, RNNs are often used for sequential data like speech or music signals, making them suitable for processing acoustic recordings.

However, without more specific details, it is impossible to definitively state what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline. It could be any of these models or even a combination of different types depending on the specific requirements and design of the system.
