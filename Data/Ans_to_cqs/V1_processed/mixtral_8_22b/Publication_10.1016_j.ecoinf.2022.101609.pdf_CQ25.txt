The purpose of the deep learning model is to make day-ahead predictions of three pollutants - PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 concentration levels. The problem is modeled as a structured data with additional features added to extend a typical time-series problem. This method allows exploring entity embeddings for the categorical features. The performance of the baseline model on individual pollutant concentration is good, indicating that this modeling approach is practical. An improved forecasting model could be applied to highways where air quality sensing devices are unavailable, but data on other features such as traffic flow and weather are captured. These models can serve as substitutes to estimate the air quality on those highways.
