The given context does not provide specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of datasets containing images of microorganisms and Cervidae, suggesting that these datasets could be sourced from various means such as surveys, sensors, or publicly available datasets. For instance, images of microorganisms might come from scientific research using microscopy techniques, while images of Cervidae could originate from wildlife monitoring projects or open databases like iNaturalist. Nonetheless, without explicit mention in the provided context, one cannot definitively state the exact methodologies employed for gathering raw data in this case.
