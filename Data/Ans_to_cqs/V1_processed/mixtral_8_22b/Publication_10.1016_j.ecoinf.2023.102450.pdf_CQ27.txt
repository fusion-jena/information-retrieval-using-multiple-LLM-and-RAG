Unfortunately, there is no information available regarding the deployment process of the trained deep learning model from the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide any specific details about the model serialization or platform selection. However, typically, after training a deep learning model, it would be saved or serialized into a format such as.h5,.onnx, or.pb, depending on the framework used. Then, this serialized model could be deployed onto various platforms like cloud services, edge devices, or mobile applications, again depending on the use case and requirements.
