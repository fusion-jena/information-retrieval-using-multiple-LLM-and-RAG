The given context does not provide information on specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. However, it mentions the use of machine learning (ML) methodologies in conjunction with satellite data interpretation for aquatic environmental monitoring. It also highlights the work of Binh et al. (2022) in developing sophisticated atmospheric correction algorithms for analyzing Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations using data from the Sentinel-3 satellite. While this indicates the use of ML techniques, no explicit mention is made of any particular optimization technique employed in the deep learning pipeline.
