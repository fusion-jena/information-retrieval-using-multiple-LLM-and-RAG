The given context does not provide explicit information about specific data annotation techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it mentions that the training dataset consists of 100 80x80 pixel image patches containing Ziziphus lotus shrubs and 100 images for bare soil with sparse vegetation. This implies that some form of labeling or annotation was performed to identify these classes within the images. Without further details, it cannot be determined whether this involved bounding boxes, semantic segmentation, or another method.
