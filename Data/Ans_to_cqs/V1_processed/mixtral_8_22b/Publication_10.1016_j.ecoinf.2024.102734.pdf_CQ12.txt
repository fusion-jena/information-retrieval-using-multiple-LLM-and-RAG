The pipeline uses two types of deep learning models: convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers. Specifically, it evaluates a pre-trained ResNet-50 architecture, which is a type of CNN, and two transformer-based models: Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) and HuBERT. These models operate on different input representations; while ResNet-50 works on single-channel images, AST processes spectrograms, and HuBERT operates directly on the 1-D waveform.
