Deep learning pipelines can utilize various types of data formats depending on the specific application or task. Some common data formats include images, audio files, videos, text, and structured data like CSV files.

Images are often used in computer vision tasks such as object detection, facial recognition, and image segmentation. These tasks typically involve training deep learning models using large datasets of labeled images.

Audio files are commonly used in applications related to speech recognition, music generation, and sound event detection. Audio data can be represented in different ways, including raw waveforms, spectrograms, and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs).

Video data is frequently employed in action recognition, motion tracking, and video summarization tasks. Videos can be processed frame by frame or as entire clips, with each approach having its own advantages and challenges.

Text data is essential for natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, and chatbot development. Text data can come in various forms, including plain text, HTML documents, and JSON objects.

Structured data, such as CSV files, is often utilized in predictive modeling tasks involving tabular data. This type of data consists of rows and columns containing numerical or categorical values representing different features or variables.

In summary, deep learning pipelines can handle multiple data formats, including images, audio files, videos, text, and structured data like CSV files. Each format has unique characteristics and requirements, making them suitable for different applications and tasks within the field of deep learning.
