The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), or others. However, it discusses the optimization of LandTrendr (LTR) parameters using figures A2-A4 and Figure 4 in Runge et al. (2022). This optimization process aims to improve the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of the model, leading to better capturing of the index response to wildfires. The text also mentions that the Kappa coefficient is chosen to assess the detection accuracy for different indices and parameter sets. It further explains that the User's Accuracy is generally higher than Producer's Accuracy, indicating that LTR has a tendency towards larger omission errors compared to commission errors. Lastly, the context emphasizes the importance of selecting appropriate indices based on regional climate and vegetation cover conditions to achieve accurate results relevant to those regions.
