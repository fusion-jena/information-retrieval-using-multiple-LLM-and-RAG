The text does not provide specific information about how the hyperparameters of the BEiT model were optimized. However, it mentions that the CAHA-AXRNet approach proposed by S.P. Sankareshwaran et al. uses the crossover-boosted artificial hummingbird algorithm to optimize hyperparameters. Unfortunately, there is no further explanation or details given regarding this optimization technique.
