In the given context, one regularization method is mentioned to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline - Dropout. The dropout rate for each task was set at 0.5 during the training process of the EfficientNet model. Dropout is a commonly used regularization technique in neural networks where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent overfitting by making the model more robust and reducing its dependency on individual neurons. Other common regularization techniques not explicitly mentioned in the context include L1 and L2 regularizations, early stopping, and weight decay. These methods help control the complexity of the model and reduce overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function or limiting the number of iterations during training.
