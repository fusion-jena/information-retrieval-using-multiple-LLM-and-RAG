In this work, the researchers contributed the largest fully labeled snow leopard dataset for deep learning research. They utilized a Min-3/Max-10 data subset, which consists of individuals with three to ten instances each, along with left-right mirroring data augmentation techniques. These methods helped reduce overfitting and improved the algorithm's ability to match individuals based on pelt patterns rather than the background. Although specific dataset names like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet were not mentioned, it is clear that the researchers focused on creating a custom snow leopard dataset tailored specifically for deep learning applications.
