The information provided does not explicitly state the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that partial data is available on Figshare. Therefore, one possible source for accessing the data could be through Figshare. Unfortunately, without more specific details or direct links, it cannot be confirmed if this is indeed the correct location for the deep learning pipeline data. It would be best to refer back to the original sources mentioned in the text for further clarification.
