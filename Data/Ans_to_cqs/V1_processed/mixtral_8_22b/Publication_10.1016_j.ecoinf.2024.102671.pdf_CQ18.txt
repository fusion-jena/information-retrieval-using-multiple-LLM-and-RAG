The text does not provide explicit details about the specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions the use of cross-validation techniques to assess the predictive accuracy and robustness of each zoning method. Cross-validation is a common technique used to evaluate the performance of a model during training by dividing the dataset into subsets or folds, then iteratively fitting the model on one subset while evaluating its performance on another. This process helps prevent overfitting and provides a reliable estimate of how well the model will perform on unseen data. Therefore, we can infer that some form of cross-validation was likely employed to monitor the model performance during training.
