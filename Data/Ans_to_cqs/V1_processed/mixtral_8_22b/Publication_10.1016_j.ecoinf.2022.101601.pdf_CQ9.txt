The information provided does not contain any reference to a specific data repository or dataset related to a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is impossible to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline might be available based solely on this context. It would require additional information about the source of the deep learning pipeline or its associated research project to provide a more accurate response.
