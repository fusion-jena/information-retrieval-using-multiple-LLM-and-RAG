Unfortunately, there isn't any explicit information about the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context. However, common data augmentation techniques often employed in deep learning pipelines include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, zooming, shearing, and brightness adjustments. These methods help increase the diversity of the dataset and improve the robustness of the model. It would be best to refer to the original research paper or source code for more detailed information regarding the specific data augmentation techniques utilized in this case.
