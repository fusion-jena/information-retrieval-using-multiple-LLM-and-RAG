Based on the provided context, one method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is field surveys. Field surveys involve gathering information directly from the source or location being studied. They are often conducted to collect data about specific phenomena, such as plant growth patterns or animal behavior, in their natural environments. However, field surveys can be costly and time-consuming due to resource requirements and the need for extensive manpower and materials. Despite these challenges, field surveys offer valuable insights into real-world scenarios that cannot always be replicated in controlled laboratory settings. Additionally, the context suggests that field survey data might be used to estimate biological parameters characterizing different species using physiologically based models. It should also be noted that field data may have higher variability compared to laboratory data due to uncontrolled environmental conditions, potentially impacting the reliability of estimations.
