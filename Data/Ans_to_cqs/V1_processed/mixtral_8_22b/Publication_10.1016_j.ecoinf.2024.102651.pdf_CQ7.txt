The context does not provide information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, or validation sets. However, it is common practice in machine learning to use a random stratified sampling method to ensure that all classes have equal representation across the splits. This helps prevent overfitting and ensures that the model generalizes well to unseen data. Other methods include using a fixed percentage split, such as 80/20 or 70/30, where 80% or 70% of the data is used for training and the remaining 20% or 30% is used for testing. Cross-validation can also be used to further evaluate the model's performance on multiple subsets of the data.
