The text mentions that an early stop approach was implemented with a patience value of 16 to regularize the model and minimize the loss function. This technique halts the training process prematurely if performance on a validation dataset fails to improve beyond a predefined threshold. Therefore, it can be inferred that the criterion used to determine when training is complete is based on the improvement or lack thereof in the performance on the validation dataset. More specifically, the training stops when the performance does not improve for a certain number of epochs, defined by the patience value. In this case, the patience value is set to 16, meaning that if the performance does not improve after 16 consecutive epochs, the training process will be stopped.
