The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is not explicitly stated; however, it can be inferred that the model is designed for image classification tasks based on the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the mention of applying the Sigmoid and Softmax functions for binary and multi-class classification, respectively. Additionally, the context mentions the application of the model for birdsong classification, suggesting that the primary goal of the model is to classify different types of birds based on their songs or visual representations of their sounds.
