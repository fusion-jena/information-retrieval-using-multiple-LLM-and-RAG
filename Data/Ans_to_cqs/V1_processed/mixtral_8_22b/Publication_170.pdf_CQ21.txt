After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be taken to evaluate the performance of the trained model. These include generating saliency maps, calculating various metrics, and creating confusion matrices.

Saliency maps help visualize the regions of input data that contribute most significantly to the output prediction made by the model. This can provide insights into how the model makes its decisions and whether it focuses on relevant features or not.

Calculation of different metrics is essential to quantify the performance of the model. As mentioned in the given context, the model performance evaluation includes both errors and time cost evaluations. Three specific metrics used here are overall error, commission error, and omission error, defined by equations (2), (3), and (4) in the paper. Overall error measures the total misclassification rate, while commission error and omission error measure false positive and false negative rates, respectively.

Creating a confusion matrix is also helpful in understanding the classification results better. A confusion matrix is a table layout that allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm. Each row of the matrix represents the instances in an actual class, while each column represents the instances in a predicted class. By analyzing this matrix, one can understand where the model performs well and where it struggles.

These postprocessing steps enable a comprehensive analysis of the model's performance and help identify areas for improvement.
