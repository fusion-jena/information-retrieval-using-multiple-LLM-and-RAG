Based on the given context, it appears that the purpose of using the random forest model is not explicitly stated as a deep learning model. However, we can infer that the random forest model is used for classification purposes. In the context provided, the random forest model is utilized to classify whether certain areas on Earth are suitable habitats for Elephas maximus based on various features such as mean annual temperature. The goal seems to be creating a model that accurately predicts these suitable habitats without overfitting to the training data.
