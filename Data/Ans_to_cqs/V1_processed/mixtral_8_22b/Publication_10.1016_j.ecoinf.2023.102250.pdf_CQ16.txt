The text does not provide explicit information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, based on common practices in machine learning, some possible criteria include reaching a certain number of epochs, achieving a desired level of performance on a validation set, observing a plateau in the validation loss, or meeting other user-defined stopping conditions. In this case, during the training process of the DR-ACGAN model, the goal is to achieve an optimal state for both the discriminator and the generator. This suggests that the training might continue until both components reach their respective optimum states.
