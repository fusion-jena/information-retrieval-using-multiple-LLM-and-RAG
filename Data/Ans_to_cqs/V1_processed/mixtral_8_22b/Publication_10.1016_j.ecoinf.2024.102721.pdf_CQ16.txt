The given text does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed in their machine learning model. However, it mentions using 5-fold cross-validation for model evaluation, which suggests they might have used some form of performance metric or error measure like Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) or coefficient of determination (R^2) to assess the model's performance during training. These metrics could be monitored over epochs or iterations to identify if the model has reached its optimal state or if the training should continue. Typically, training would stop when these metrics reach a satisfactory level or start showing no significant improvement with further training.
