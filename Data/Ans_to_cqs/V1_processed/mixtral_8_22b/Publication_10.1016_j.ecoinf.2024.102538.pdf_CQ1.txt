The context does not provide explicit information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions two benchmark datasets - BirdCLEF2018-Small (BC-S) and BirdCLEF2018-Large (BC-L) - which were recorded in Europe and America. This suggests that audio recordings could be a method for gathering raw data. Additionally, another dataset called Lishui-Zhejiang Birdsdata (LS) was mentioned, with its recordings being made in China. Therefore, it can be inferred that audio recording devices or sensors might be used for capturing raw data in these cases. Publicly available datasets may also be utilized for obtaining raw data.
