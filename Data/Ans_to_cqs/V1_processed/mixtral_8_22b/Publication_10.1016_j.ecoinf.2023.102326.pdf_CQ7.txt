The text does not provide explicit information regarding the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (train, test, validation). However, common practices include splitting the data randomly or stratified based on specific features such as land use type or time of day. The typical ratios used for this purpose are 70/15/15 (training/validation/testing) or 80/10/10. Without further details, it cannot be determined if these standard practices were followed in this case.
