The text does not provide explicit information about how the data was split for deep learning model training (train, test, validation sets). However, it mentions using a subset of the Benthoz15 dataset consisting of images from Western Australia (WA) to train their classifier. This suggests that they may have divided the dataset into training and testing or validation sets. Typically, when working with deep learning models, one might use a percentage split (e.g., 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing) or employ techniques like k-fold cross-validation. Unfortunately, without more specific details, it cannot be determined exactly what method was used to divide the data in this case.
