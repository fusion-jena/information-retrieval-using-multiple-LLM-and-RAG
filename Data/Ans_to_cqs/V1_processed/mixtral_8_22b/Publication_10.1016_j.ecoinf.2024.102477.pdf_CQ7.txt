The context does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to use a random stratified sampling technique or a temporal split when dealing with time-series data. The typical ratios used for splitting the dataset are 60-20-20 (train-test-validation) or 80-10-10, depending on the size of the dataset and the specific requirements of the project. It is essential to ensure that the splits maintain the same distribution as the original dataset to avoid introducing bias into the model.
