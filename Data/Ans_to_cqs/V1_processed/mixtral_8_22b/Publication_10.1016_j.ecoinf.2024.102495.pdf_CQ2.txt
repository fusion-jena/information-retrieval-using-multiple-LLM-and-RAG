The text mentions that CNN, a type of deep learning model, is commonly used to process two or more dimensions of data with high complexity, such as images or sound data. Therefore, we can infer that the deep learning pipeline discussed in this context uses both image and audio data formats. However, there is no mention of video or CSV data being used in this specific case.
