Unfortunately, there is no specific mention of any deep learning models or their generalizability measures in the given context. Therefore, it is impossible to provide a direct answer to your query based solely on the provided text.

However, some general principles can be mentioned regarding ensuring the generalizability of deep learning models. These include using diverse datasets, employing techniques like cross-validation, stratified sampling, or k-fold validation, and applying regularization methods to prevent overfitting. Additionally, hyperparameter tuning and ensemble methods are also commonly used strategies to improve the performance and generalizability of deep learning models.
