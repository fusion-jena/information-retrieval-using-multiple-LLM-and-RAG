Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as using a fixed random seed value or other techniques. However, some general practices often used in deep learning pipelines include setting a fixed random seed value before running experiments to ensure reproducibility, using deterministic algorithms when possible, and employing cross-validation techniques to mitigate the effects of random initialization. In this particular context, the authors do not discuss any specific methods they use to address randomness in their deep learning pipeline.
