The provided context does not directly discuss the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that similar preprocessing techniques used in machine learning models may also apply to deep learning models. These techniques often involve data cleaning, normalization, and scaling. Data cleaning involves removing or correcting erroneous data points, while normalization scales numeric columns to a range between 0 and 1. Scaling adjusts the values of numeric features to have approximately mean = 0 and variance = 1. These preprocessing steps help improve the performance and efficiency of the deep learning model by ensuring that all input features contribute equally to the final output.
