Based on the given context, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images. Specifically, the input images have dimensions of 512x512 pixels with three color channels. These images are fed into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classification purposes. Additionally, the context mentions the use of Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to generate heatmaps that highlight important aspects of each head capsule used in the taxonomic decision-making process of the model. Therefore, we can conclude that the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is images.
