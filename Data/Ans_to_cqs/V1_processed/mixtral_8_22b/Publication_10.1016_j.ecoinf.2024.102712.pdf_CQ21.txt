After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the study or application. In this case, the authors mention two main postprocessing steps: inspection of residual plots and validation of the model using a leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) approach.

Inspection of residual plots involves examining the differences between the predicted and actual values of aboveground biomass density (AGBD) to assess the accuracy and reliability of the model. This step helps identify any patterns or trends in the errors, which could suggest potential issues with the model or the input data.

Validation of the model using LOOCV involves iteratively leaving out one observation from the dataset, fitting the model to the remaining observations, and then predicting the left-out observation. The process is repeated until each observation has been left out once. This technique provides a more robust evaluation of the model performance by reducing overfitting and improving generalization.

Additionally, the authors report several metrics to evaluate the model performance, including the root mean square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), and bias. These metrics provide insights into different aspects of the model's accuracy and precision, allowing researchers to compare models and select the most appropriate one for their purposes.

Other common postprocessing steps not explicitly mentioned in this context include generating saliency maps, calculating confusion matrices, and performing sensitivity analysis. However, these techniques may not always be relevant or necessary depending on the goals and scope of the study.
