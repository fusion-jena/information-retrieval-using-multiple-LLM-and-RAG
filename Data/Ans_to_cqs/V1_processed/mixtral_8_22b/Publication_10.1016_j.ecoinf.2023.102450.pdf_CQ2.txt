The paper by Z. Yin et al. uses a dataset consisting of videos and images for training and testing their deep learning model. Specifically, they use three classes of shapes - circular curves, straight lines, and 8-shaped curves. Each class has a certain number of videos and corresponding images extracted from those videos. For example, there are 10 videos of circular curves, which have a total duration of 927 seconds and contain 27,819 images. Similarly, there are 22 videos of straight lines and 10 videos of 8-shaped curves, each having its own set of durations and images. Therefore, it can be concluded that this particular deep learning pipeline uses both video and image data formats.
