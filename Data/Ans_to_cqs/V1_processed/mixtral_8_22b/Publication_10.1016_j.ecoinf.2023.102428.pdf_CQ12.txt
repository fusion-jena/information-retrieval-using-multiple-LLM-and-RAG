The pipeline uses a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model, which is a type of feedforward artificial neural network. This model is part of the broader category of deep learning models but differs from other types such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or Transformers. The MLP model is characterized by its multiple layers of interconnected nodes, or neurons, where each node in one layer connects to every node in the next layer. It uses a process called backpropagation to adjust the weights and biases of these connections based on the error of the output compared to the desired result.
