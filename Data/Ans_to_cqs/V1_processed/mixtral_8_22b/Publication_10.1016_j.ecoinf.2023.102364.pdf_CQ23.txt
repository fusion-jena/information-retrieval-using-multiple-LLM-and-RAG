The article does not provide explicit details about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it mentions using multi-year fieldwork and open access data, which could contribute to a diverse dataset. Additionally, the use of machine learning ensemble models like Random Forest, TreeNet, CART, and MARS suggests some form of cross-validation or bootstrapping might have been employed during training. Nevertheless, without more detailed information, we cannot definitively state what measures were specifically used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
