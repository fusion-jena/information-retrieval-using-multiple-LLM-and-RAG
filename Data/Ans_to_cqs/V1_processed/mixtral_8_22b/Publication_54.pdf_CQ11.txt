The provided context does not contain information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that the authors used a deep-learning-based model called Inception-ResNet-v2 to train and learn the features of 27 endemic bird species (source domain), which were then transferred to a second target network to train the newly added dataset on endemic bird species (target domain). The paper also compares the classification accuracies achieved by different learning models but does not provide any links to data repositories containing the datasets used in their study.
