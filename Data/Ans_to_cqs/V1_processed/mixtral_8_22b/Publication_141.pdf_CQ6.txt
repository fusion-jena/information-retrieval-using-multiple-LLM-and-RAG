The text does not provide explicit information about specific preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it mentions several other strategies employed before training the deep learning model. These include a two-stage training process, data augmentation, and application of dropout techniques.

In the first stage of the training process, only a top classifier (fully connected layer) is trained based on features extracted from processing images with a pretrained convolutional part of the network. This suggests that some form of feature extraction has been carried out prior to the actual training.

Data augmentation is another technique mentioned, which involves randomly deforming input images in each training cycle. This step helps increase the diversity of the training data without actually collecting new samples, thus improving the model's ability to generalize.

Dropout techniques are also applied to extracted features to enhance model robustness. Dropout is a regularization method that approximates training a large number of neural networks with different architectures in parallel. During training, some number of neuron outputs are randomly ignored or “dropped out.” This has the effect of making the training process noisy, forcing nodes within a layer to probabilistically take on more or less responsibility for the inputs. It reduces overfitting and improves the model’s performance on unseen data.
