The text does not explicitly state the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions that the optimal number of training epochs is identified after full training. This suggests that some form of monitoring is done during training to identify the point at which further training would not significantly improve the model's performance. Additionally, the use of a separate validation dataset (Bv) implies that validation loss could be monitored to detect overfitting and determine the optimal number of epochs. Therefore, while not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that criteria such as validation loss plateau or lack of significant improvement in validation performance might have been used to decide when training should be stopped.
