To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. One common technique is stratified splitting, where the dataset is split into training, validation, and testing subsets while maintaining the class proportions in each subset. This ensures that the model learns from a representative sample of the entire dataset, reducing potential biases. Another technique is oversampling, which involves duplicating examples from the underrepresented classes to balance the dataset. Undersampling, conversely, removes examples from the majority class to achieve a balanced distribution. Both oversampling and undersampling aim to mitigate imbalanced datasets, but they should be used carefully to avoid introducing other types of bias or losing valuable information. Additionally, diverse data collection is essential to ensure that the dataset represents various scenarios and conditions relevant to the problem being addressed. By incorporating diverse data sources, the model can capture a broader range of patterns and improve its overall performance and generalizability.
