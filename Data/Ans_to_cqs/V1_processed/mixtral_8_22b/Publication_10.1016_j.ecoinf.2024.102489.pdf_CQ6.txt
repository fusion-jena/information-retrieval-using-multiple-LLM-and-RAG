The given context does not provide explicit information about specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it mentions some general practices related to preparing data for machine learning models like Random Forest (RF) models. These include eliminating cloud-contaminated and poor-quality pixels using pixel quality control metrics of MODIS products, removing outliers from training samples, and selecting a sufficient number of LAI training samples. Additionally, while building the RF model, the training samples were divided into two parts - one for training and another for testing purposes. GridSearchCV was employed to find the optimal parameters of the model. While these steps might also apply to deep learning models, they do not cover all possible preprocessing techniques typically applied before training a deep learning model. Common preprocessing steps for deep learning models may include normalizing or standardizing input features, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.
