The text does not provide information on the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, common postprocessing steps include generating saliency maps to visualize which parts of the input data most influenced the model's predictions, calculating metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the model's performance, and creating confusion matrices to understand false positives and negatives. These steps help researchers interpret their models and improve them if necessary.
