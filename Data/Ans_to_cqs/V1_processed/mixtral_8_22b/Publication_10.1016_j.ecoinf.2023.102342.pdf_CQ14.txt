Unfortunately, based on the provided context, it does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, such as through methods like grid search or random search. It primarily focuses on explaining the concept of the support parameter and the Apriori algorithm used in data mining. However, without additional information about the specific model being used, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding its hyperparameter optimization method.
