The authors have not explicitly mentioned any specific techniques such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning models. However, they do discuss the use of different hyperparameters for each of the two detection models used - YOLOX and YOLOv8. These include initial learning rates, learning rate schedules, Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) thresholds, confidence thresholds, weight decays, image sizes, batch sizes, optimizers, classification losses, location losses, and data augmentations.

Additionally, the authors mention using color jitter and mosaic data augmentation techniques for one of the models, while another uses VFL (Vertical Federated Learning), DFL (Dynamic Federated Learning), and CIoU (Complete Intersection over Union) for data augmentation.

While these details suggest that the authors took steps to improve the robustness and accuracy of their models, there is no explicit discussion about strategies specifically aimed at ensuring the generalizability of the models across different domains or scenarios.

However, the authors do acknowledge the importance of assessing domain gaps or shifts between training and testing data for improving cross-domain performance and deciding if domain adaptation or generalization is required for unseen data. They also propose future research directions focusing on this aspect.
