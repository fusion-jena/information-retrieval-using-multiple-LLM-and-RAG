Based on the given information, there isn't any explicit mention of a specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, it can be inferred that the authors have evaluated the accuracy of the proposed models and compared them with each other and with other fully-supervised models. This suggests that some form of performance evaluation was conducted during or after the training process. Additionally, the use of a semi-supervised model for accelerating model development speed and a weakly-supervised model for balancing development time and accuracy implies that the authors were concerned about the efficiency and effectiveness of their models. Therefore, it can be assumed that some sort of performance monitoring strategy was likely employed during the training phase, although the exact details are not explicitly stated in the provided context.
