Based on the given information, it appears that the study primarily uses raster and vector data formats. The LULC dataset is a raster format with a high spatial resolution of 10 meters per pixel. Other datasets mentioned include MNT-Lidar, Weather data, Database of Parcels and Declared Agricultural Production (BDPPAD), Geobase of Quebec Hydrographic Network (GRHQ), and Geobase Addresses Quebec. However, the specific file formats for these datasets are not explicitly stated. It is common for raster data to be stored in formats such as.TIFF,.GEOTIFF, or.IMG, while vector data might use formats like.SHP,.KML, or.GPX. Without more detailed information about each dataset, I cannot definitively state the exact file formats used in the deep learning pipeline.
