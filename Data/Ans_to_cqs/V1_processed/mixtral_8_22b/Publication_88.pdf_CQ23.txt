To ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model, several measures were taken during its development and evaluation process. Firstly, the authors utilized diverse datasets consisting of satellite images from both the Amazon and Cerrado regions. These datasets contained various types of land cover, such as deforestation and non-deforestation areas, which helped improve the robustness of the model.

Secondly, the data was split into different subsets – training, validation, and testing – using stratified sampling based on the available deforested and non-deforested samples. This approach ensured that the class distribution remained consistent across all subsets, preventing any potential bias towards specific classes.

Thirdly, the authors employed a technique called early stopping while training the model. Early stopping involves monitoring the performance of the model on the validation set and halting the training process when there is no further improvement observed over multiple epochs. This helps prevent overfitting and improves the model's ability to generalize well to unseen data.

Lastly, the authors also experimented with varying numbers of training samples to assess the influence of sample size on the model's performance. By doing so, they could determine the optimal amount of training data required to achieve good generalization without compromising computational efficiency or risking overfitting.

In summary, the authors took several steps to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model, including utilizing diverse datasets, employing stratified sampling for data splitting, implementing early stopping during training, and evaluating the impact of varying training sample sizes.
