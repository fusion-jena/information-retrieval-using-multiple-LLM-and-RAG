Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps may be involved depending on the nature of the data and the requirements of the model. However, the given context does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps. Nevertheless, from general knowledge about deep learning, common preprocessing techniques include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization involves rescaling the values of features so they fall within a specific range, often between 0 and 1. Scaling refers to transforming the feature values into a standard scale, such as mean=0 and variance=1. Cleaning involves removing noise, outliers, or irrelevant information from the data. Additionally, for image data, other preprocessing steps might include resizing images, converting them to grayscale, or augmenting the dataset through rotation, flipping, or cropping. However, these specific details are not mentioned in the provided context.
