The study does not explicitly mention any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it is mentioned that the classification accuracy and performance improved as data increased during the training of a deep learning model using satellite imageries over multiple periods. This suggests that collecting diverse data from different periods may help improve the performance and reduce potential biases in the dataset. Additionally, the study mentions using phenological characteristics to classify elements even in the absence of specific classes, which implies that feature engineering might have been employed to extract meaningful features from the raw data. Nevertheless, without explicit information about the preprocessing techniques used to handle data bias, one cannot definitively state what methods were utilized in this particular study.
