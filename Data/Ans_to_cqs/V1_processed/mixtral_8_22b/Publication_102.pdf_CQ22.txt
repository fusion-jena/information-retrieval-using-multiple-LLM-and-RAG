The performance of the deep learning models in this study is evaluated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). These metrics measure the difference between the predicted values and the actual values. Lower values of RMSE and MAE indicate better performance of the model. For instance, Model-2 achieved an RMSE value of 1.88 and 0.60 for the SSL and elephantsâ€™ datasets, respectively, while Model-K had an RMSE of 2.17 and 0.81 for the same datasets.
