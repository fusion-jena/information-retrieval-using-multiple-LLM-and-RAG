Based on the given information, it appears that the authors have conducted their experiments using a subset of the total dataset and performed multiple runs (specifically, 20 runs) to evaluate the performance of different feature representation methods such as Spectral Indices, MFCC, and Auto Encoders. This approach can contribute to ensuring the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there is no specific mention of other techniques like diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting being employed to further enhance the model's robustness and generalization capabilities. Therefore, while some steps towards ensuring generalizability are evident from the available data, additional details regarding the application of more sophisticated validation strategies would be required to provide a comprehensive response.
