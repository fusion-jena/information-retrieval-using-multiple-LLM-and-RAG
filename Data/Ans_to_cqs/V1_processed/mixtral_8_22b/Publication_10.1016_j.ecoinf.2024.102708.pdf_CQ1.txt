The article discusses using drone imagery for mapping the density of wild Pacific oysters. This suggests that the method utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is through remote sensing via drones. The drones capture high-resolution images which are then processed and analyzed using convolutional neural networks (CNN), a type of deep learning algorithm.

From the abstract, we learn that the research focuses on managing the expansion of invasive Pacific oysters into protected areas. To achieve this, they collected drone imagery from two different sites - Scoble and Collapit. These images were divided into smaller sections called 'tiles', some of which contained Pacific oysters while others did not.

The number of tiles collected from each site is mentioned in the text: 3643 tiles from the Scoble site (with 758 containing Pacific oysters) and 7571 tiles from the Collapit site (with 879 containing Pacific oysters). This indicates that the researchers gathered a substantial amount of raw data using drones.

Furthermore, the article mentions that data augmentation techniques were employed to expand the training dataset by creating modified versions of existing images. However, it appears that these modifications were made solely to the images containing Pacific oysters, rather than being applied to all collected images.

In summary, the primary method used for gathering raw data in this deep learning pipeline is capturing high-resolution drone imagery. This approach allows for efficient collection of large amounts of visual data, which can subsequently be processed and analyzed using CNN algorithms to map the density of wild Pacific oysters.
