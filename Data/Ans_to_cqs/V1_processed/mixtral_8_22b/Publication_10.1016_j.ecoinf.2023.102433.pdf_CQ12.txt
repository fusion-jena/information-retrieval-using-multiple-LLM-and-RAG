According to the given information, it is not explicitly mentioned what specific type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline. However, it is stated that deep learning analysis can be performed using TensorFlow, which is a machine learning and artificial intelligence open-source framework developed by the Google Brain team. TensorFlow supports various types of neural networks including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and others. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot determine the exact type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It could be any of the models supported by TensorFlow.
