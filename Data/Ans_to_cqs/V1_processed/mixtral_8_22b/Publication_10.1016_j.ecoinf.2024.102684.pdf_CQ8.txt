The given text does not provide any explicit information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot determine if it is hosted on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. To find this information, one would need additional details regarding the authors, project name, or other relevant keywords to conduct a proper search.

Based on the provided context, here are some key points related to the study:

* A hyperparameter search was conducted over two sites considering the activation function, optimizer, and learning rate.
* An exhaustive search was carried out for the fully connected architecture for both mono-site and multi-site models.
* Training, validation, and testing performances were compared to prevent overfitting.
* Hyperparameter search software like Optuna and Sklearn could have been used but were avoided to maintain full control over the process.
* The small grid search included hidden activation functions (ReLU, sigmoid, or elu), optimizers (RMSprop or Adam), and learning rates (0.1, 0.001, 0.0001, and 0.00001).
* The study focuses on applying deep learning techniques in remote sensing while addressing the challenge of developing reliable model validation frameworks.
* The researchers aim to improve the ability of deep learning models to generalize and transfer learned patterns to new contexts, especially in diverse landscapes with significant terrain and spectral property variations.
* The methodology involves a six-step workflow to assess the transfer learning of CNN regression models under different scenarios.
