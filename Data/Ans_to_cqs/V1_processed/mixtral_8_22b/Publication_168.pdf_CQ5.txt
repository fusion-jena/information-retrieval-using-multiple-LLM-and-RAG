The context does not provide specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipelines mentioned. However, it mentions that the designed 1-D-CNN achieved satisfactory classification performance despite having a simple structure due to insufficient training data. Additionally, it states that the spectral-spatial residual network achieved the highest classification accuracy on three data sets, without specifying what those data sets were. Similarly, the HybridSN architecture was tested on three data sets, but their names are not mentioned. Lastly, the DCNN proposed by Zhang et al. achieved the best classification performances on two data sets compared to other methods, but again, no details about these data sets are given. Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot determine the exact datasets used in the deep learning pipelines discussed.
