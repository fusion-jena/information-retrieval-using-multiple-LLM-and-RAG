Before training a deep learning model, various preprocessing steps can be applied depending on the nature of the dataset. These may include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and augmentation. Normalization involves rescaling the features so they fall within a specific range, such as between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. Scaling adjusts the scale of independent variables to bring them to an appropriate level. Cleaning refers to handling missing or inconsistent data points by removing or imputing them. Data augmentation generates new samples by applying transformations like rotation, flipping, zooming, etc., which helps improve the model's generalizability. However, not all datasets require every step, and some might benefit more from certain techniques than others. It ultimately depends on the characteristics of the dataset and the problem being addressed.
