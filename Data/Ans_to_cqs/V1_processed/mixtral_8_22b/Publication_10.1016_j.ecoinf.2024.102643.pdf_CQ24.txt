The query asks about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, specifically regarding random seed values. However, none of the provided sources directly address this topic. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific strategy based on these sources.

In general, some common strategies used to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline include fixing the random seed value, using deterministic algorithms where possible, and employing techniques such as cross-validation and bootstrapping to estimate model performance accurately. These methods help ensure reproducibility and consistency in results across different runs of the same model.
