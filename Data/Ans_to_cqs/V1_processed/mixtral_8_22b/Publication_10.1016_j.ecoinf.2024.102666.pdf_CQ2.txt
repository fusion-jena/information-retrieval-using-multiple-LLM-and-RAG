The data formats used in the deep learning pipeline primarily include satellite images. These images are captured by various sensors such as MSI and OLCI, which have different central wavelengths and resolutions. The spectral bands used in these images are blue, green, red, and near-infrared. Additionally, there is mention of in-situ measured data, but it is not explicitly stated what format this data takes. There is no mention of other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV files being used in the deep learning pipeline.
