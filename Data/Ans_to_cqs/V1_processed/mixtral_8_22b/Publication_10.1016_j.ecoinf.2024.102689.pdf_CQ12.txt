The given context does not explicitly mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, there are several references to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), suggesting that they might be part of the pipeline. For example, Rauf et al. (2019) proposed a deep learning framework based on the CNN method for fish species recognition. Additionally, Spampinato et al. (2008) mentioned detecting, tracking, and counting fish in low-quality unconstrained underwater videos, which could involve CNNs or other types of models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for temporal data processing. Lastly, Zhang et al. (2021) developed an underwater fish individual recognition method based on improved YOLOv4 and FaceNet, both of which use convolutional layers. Therefore, while the exact type of deep learning model used in the pipeline remains unknown, there are strong indications that CNNs play a significant role in various aspects of fish detection, tracking, and recognition tasks.
