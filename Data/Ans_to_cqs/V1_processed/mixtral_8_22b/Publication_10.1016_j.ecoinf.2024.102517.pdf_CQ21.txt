The given context does not provide explicit information about any specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, based on general machine learning practices, some common postprocessing steps could include evaluating the performance of the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score. Additionally, creating confusion matrices can help visualize the performance of the model across different classes. Visualizing saliency maps might also be useful to understand which parts of the input data were most important for the model's predictions. But without more specific details about the model architecture or the problem domain, it is difficult to provide a definitive list of postprocessing steps.
