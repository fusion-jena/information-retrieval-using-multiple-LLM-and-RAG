The paper uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as its primary deep learning model for plant leaf classification tasks. This information can be found in Table 4, where various ranges of hyperparameters for the CNN model are listed, including filters, filter sizes, neurons, batch sizes, epochs, and optimizers. Additionally, the paper mentions using a Deep Attention Dense CNN model for plant leaf disease classification, further confirming the use of CNN models in their research.
