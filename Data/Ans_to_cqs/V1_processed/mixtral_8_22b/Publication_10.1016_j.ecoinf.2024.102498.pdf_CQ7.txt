In this study, 33,209 samples were collected using a stratified sampling approach. Out of these, 70% were allocated for training, while the remaining 30% were employed for testing. For hyperparameter tuning of ML models, validation data consisting of 10% of the training data was used. The specific hyperparameters set for each model during training and validation are presented in Table 3. These include max nodes, min leaf population, number of trees, bag fraction, variables per split, shrinkage, sampling rate, loss, kernel type, SVM type, and decision procedure.
