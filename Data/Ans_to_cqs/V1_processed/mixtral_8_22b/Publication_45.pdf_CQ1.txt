The context does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the given sources that the study uses a dataset related to bark beetle outbreaks in coniferous forests. This dataset covers an area of 13,319 hectares and is available online (Seidl et al., 2015). Additionally, more information about the dataset and its statistical analysis can be found in Seidl et al. (2016). Unfortunately, without further details or access to the mentioned references, I cannot provide specific information regarding the collection methods of this raw data.
