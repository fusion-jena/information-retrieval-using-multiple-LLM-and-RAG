The authors used a random subset of 5256 pictures (80% of the total dataset) for training their deep learning models. This means that they randomly selected 80% of the images from the entire dataset to use for training purposes. They did not explicitly mention any separate validation set, so it is assumed that they only used a single split for training and testing. However, they mentioned repeating the training-testing process 10 times for each algorithm, ensuring that all five algorithms used the same training and testing picture subsets in each replicate run. This suggests that they might have been using cross-validation techniques to evaluate the performance of their models. In summary, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training were a random selection of 80% of the dataset for training and the remaining 20% for testing, without any explicit mention of a separate validation set.
