The text does not provide explicit information about the specific methods used for hyperparameter optimization such as grid search or random search. However, it mentions that the optimization method for neural network parameters is based on stochastic gradient descent algorithms. This suggests that the hyperparameters might also be optimized using similar techniques, possibly involving some form of iterative refinement or adaptation during training. Nonetheless, without further details, it cannot be definitively stated which exact methods are employed for hyperparameter optimization.
