The text does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a specific random seed value. However, it can be inferred that the authors might have controlled for randomness during their experiments by fixing the random seed values before running their code. This practice ensures that results are reproducible and comparable across multiple runs. Additionally, techniques like cross-validation and bootstrapping could be employed to assess the robustness of the models against variations due to randomness.
