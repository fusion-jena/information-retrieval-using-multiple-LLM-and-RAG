The given context does not directly discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it does mention methods used for improving NDVI reconstruction and long-term vegetation cover studies using deep learning enhanced fusion methods. These include applying optimal weighted allocation, introducing optimal weights for prediction simulation results based on spatial and temporal dimensions, and minimizing the sum of squares of combined prediction errors within a specific time period. While these methods do not specifically target data bias, they contribute to improving the quality and accuracy of NDVI datasets by addressing issues like missing values due to clouds or other factors. To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, one could consider implementing techniques such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, or collecting more diverse data. Stratified sampling involves dividing the data into homogeneous subgroups before selecting samples, ensuring each group is proportionally represented. Oversampling increases the number of instances in minority classes, while undersampling reduces instances in majority classes to balance the dataset. Collecting more diverse data can also help reduce bias by including a wider range of examples in the training process.
