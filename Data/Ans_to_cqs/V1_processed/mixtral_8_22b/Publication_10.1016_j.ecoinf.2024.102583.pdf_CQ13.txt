The text does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. However, common hyperparameters in deep learning models include learning rate, optimizer, batch size, number of epochs, and regularization parameters. The learning rate determines how much the weights should be adjusted during training, while the optimizer algorithm specifies how these updates are performed. Batch size refers to the number of samples processed before updating the internal model parameters, and the number of epochs defines the total number of iterations through the dataset. Regularization parameters help prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. Without explicit information on the hyperparameters used in this study, one cannot definitively state what they were.

Based on the given context, I am unable to determine the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. However, some commonly used hyperparameters in deep learning models include learning rate, optimizer, batch size, number of epochs, and regularization parameters.
