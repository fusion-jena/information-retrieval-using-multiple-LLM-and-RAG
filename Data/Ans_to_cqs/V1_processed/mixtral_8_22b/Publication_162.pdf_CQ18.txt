The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using a feedback mechanism known as active learning. This mechanism involves human input to optimize the system while minimizing manual labeling efforts. At certain intervals, the system forwards images to humans for annotation, and these images are then used to train a classifier iteratively. Evaluation is carried out with a retained test set of images annotated manually. Additionally, since the monitoring devices may detect species unknown to the recognition system, novelty detection is employed to allow for continuous improvement of the system over time through lifelong learning algorithms. These algorithms enable updates to the classification models when new data becomes available.
