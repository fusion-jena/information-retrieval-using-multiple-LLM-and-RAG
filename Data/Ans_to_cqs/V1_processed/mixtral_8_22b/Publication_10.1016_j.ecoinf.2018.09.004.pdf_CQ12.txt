Based on the given information, there is no mention of using a specific deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers in the pipeline. Instead, the text discusses various traditional machine learning techniques including Support Vector Machines (SVMs), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Trees. Therefore, based on this information alone, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the usage of a particular deep learning model in the pipeline.
