The text does not provide explicit information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some common techniques include stratified splitting, where the dataset is divided into training and testing sets while maintaining the same class distribution, oversampling or undersampling to balance classes, and diverse data collection to ensure a wide range of representative samples. These techniques can help mitigate issues related to imbalanced datasets and improve model performance.

Based on the given context, it appears that the authors may have employed some form of data balancing or normalization during preprocessing, but the exact method remains unclear without further details. The study mentions the use of bootstrapping, which involves creating multiple subsets of the original dataset through random sampling with replacement. While this technique is often used for estimating statistical parameters, it could also potentially aid in addressing data bias if applied appropriately. Nonetheless, the primary focus of the paper seems to revolve around analyzing large audio datasets rather than discussing specific deep learning pipeline preprocessing techniques.
