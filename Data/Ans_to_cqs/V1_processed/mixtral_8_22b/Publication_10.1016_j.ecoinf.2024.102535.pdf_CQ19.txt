Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to determine which specific framework was used to build the deep learning model. The text only mentions the use of various network architectures such as VGG, ResNet, and Xception but does not provide any details about the programming framework or library employed to implement these architectures. Therefore, I cannot definitively state whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or some other framework was utilized.
