Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be taken to improve its performance. These include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing any irrelevant, redundant, or incorrect information from the dataset. It also includes handling missing values if present.

2. Normalization/Standardization: This step scales numerical input variables so they have zero mean and unit variance. This is done because many machine learning algorithms perform better when numerical input variables are scaled to a standard range.

3. Feature Scaling: This process rescales the values of features to fit into a small specified range like -1 to 1 or 0 to 1. This is important for optimization algorithms such as gradient descent which are used within neural networks.

4. Encoding Categorical Variables: Deep learning models cannot handle categorical data directly. So, we need to convert these categorical variables into numbers using techniques like label encoding, one hot encoding etc.

5. Splitting Dataset: Before feeding our data into the model, itâ€™s common practice to split the dataset into three parts: Training set, validation set, and test set. This helps us understand how well our model generalizes to unseen data.

6. Data Augmentation: In some cases, particularly with image data, we might not have enough data to train our model effectively. To overcome this problem, we can use various techniques to augment our existing data. For example, flipping images horizontally or vertically, rotating them slightly, zooming in or out, etc.
