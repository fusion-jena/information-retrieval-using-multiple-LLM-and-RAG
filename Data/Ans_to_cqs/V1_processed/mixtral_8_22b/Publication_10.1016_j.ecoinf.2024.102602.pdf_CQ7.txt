The data was split using 5-fold cross validation for the deep learning model training. This means that the dataset was divided into five equal subsets or 'folds'. At each iteration of the 5-fold cross validation, one subset was used for evaluating the models, while the remaining four subsets were used for training (90% of the images) and validation (10% of the images). This approach allows for a more robust and unbiased estimate of a modelâ€™s performance, and it also guides effective hyper-parameter tuning for improved overall performance.
