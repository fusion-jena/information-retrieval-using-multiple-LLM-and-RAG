The context does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, common practices include splitting the data randomly or stratified based on class labels. Typically, the data is divided into three sets: training set, validation set, and testing set. The training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Finally, the testing set is used to evaluate the performance of the trained model. In this case, it appears that the data was split into a training set and a testing set, as evidenced by the presence of RMSE\_Train, MAE\_Train, RMSE\_Test, and MAE\_Test values. It is possible that a separate validation set was also used but not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
