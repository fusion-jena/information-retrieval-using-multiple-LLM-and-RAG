The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, there is a reference to spatial inputs with dimensions 257 x 257 x 9, denoted as M (masks of states). This suggests that the data format being used is likely some form of multi-dimensional array or tensor, possibly representing images or grids. Without further information, it cannot be definitively stated whether additional data formats such as audio, video, or CSV files are also utilized within the deep learning pipeline.
