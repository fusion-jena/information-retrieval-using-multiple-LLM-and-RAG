The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the given context is semantic segmentation. This can be inferred from the use of the term "U-net," which is a popular convolutional neural network architecture used for semantic segmentation tasks. Additionally, the mention of identifying features in large amounts of data, such as individual tree species mapping in tropical forests, further supports the idea that the deep learning model is being used for semantic segmentation.

Semantic segmentation involves assigning each pixel in an image to a specific class label, allowing for detailed understanding and analysis of the scene. In this case, the deep learning model is likely being used to segment different tree species within very high-resolution images of tropical forests. By doing so, researchers can better understand the distribution and range of various plant species, contributing to our knowledge of ecological mechanisms governing these natural processes.
