While the given context does not explicitly mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, it provides insights into the application of deep learning models, specifically LSTM networks, in carbon emission forecasting. However, addressing data bias is crucial in any machine learning or deep learning task. Common techniques include stratified sampling, which ensures that different subgroups in the population are represented proportionately in all samples, oversampling, where minority classes are replicated to match the majority class, undersampling, where instances from the majority class are removed to match the minority class, and diverse data collection, which involves gathering data from various sources to ensure representation. These techniques help mitigate issues such as imbalanced datasets, skewed distributions, and lack of diversity, ultimately improving the fairness and reliability of the model predictions.
