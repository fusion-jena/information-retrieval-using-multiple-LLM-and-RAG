Unfortunately, there is no information available regarding the deployment process of the trained deep learning model in the given context. The text only discusses feature selection, evaluation criteria for machine learning models, and performance statistics of different models used for predicting groundwater salinity hazard maps. Therefore, I cannot provide any specific details about the deployment process such as model serialization or platform selection.
