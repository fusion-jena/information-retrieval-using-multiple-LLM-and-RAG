After the model training process, there are several postprocessing steps that can be taken to evaluate the performance of the model and interpret its results. Some common postprocessing steps include:

1. Saliency maps: These are visualizations that highlight the regions of an image that contribute most strongly to the output of a neural network. They can help identify which features of the input data are important for making predictions.
2. Metrics calculation: Various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc. can be calculated to quantify the performance of the model. These metrics provide insights into how well the model is able to classify or regress the target variable.
3. Confusion matrix: This is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification algorithm. It shows the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives for each class. This information can be used to calculate various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Based on the given context, it appears that the authors used a combination of these postprocessing techniques to validate their model. Specifically, they mention using the Area Under ROC Curve (AUC) metric to evaluate the performance of their model in predicting the species distribution. Additionally, they state that out of the in-situ occurrences of Rhododendron arboreum at ground locations, only 70% of the data were used in calibrating the model, while the remaining 30% of the data were used to test the model. This suggests that they likely also used some form of confusion matrix or similar technique to assess the performance of their model on both the training and testing datasets. However, without more specific details about the exact methods used, it is difficult to provide a more detailed response.
