The given context does not provide information about any specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it appears to be related to various studies on topics like drought tolerance in Mediterranean species, limitations of global bioclimatic datasets for ecological niche modeling, and mid-Holocene vegetation and climatic history of the Iberian Peninsula. Therefore, based on this context, we cannot determine which datasets were used in a deep learning pipeline.
