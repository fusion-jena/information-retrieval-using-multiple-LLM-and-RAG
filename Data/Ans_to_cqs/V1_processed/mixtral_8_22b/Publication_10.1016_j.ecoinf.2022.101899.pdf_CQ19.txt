The papers by Halgamuge et al. (2020) and Dowdy (2020) do not explicitly mention which specific deep learning framework was used to develop their respective models. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively state whether they used TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other deep learning framework. However, both studies focus on applying deep learning techniques to predict wildfire events in Australia, with Halgamuge et al. (2020) focusing on optimizer selection methods and Dowdy (2020) concentrating on seasonal prediction systems.
