The text does not explicitly mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it mentions that the main tool of deep learning is the deep neural network (DNN), which is built upon artificial neural networks (ANNs). Therefore, we can infer that the authors use some form of deep neural network (DNN) or artificial neural network (ANN) in their pipeline. Unfortunately, without more information, we cannot determine if they specifically use convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers, or another type of DNN/ANN architecture.
