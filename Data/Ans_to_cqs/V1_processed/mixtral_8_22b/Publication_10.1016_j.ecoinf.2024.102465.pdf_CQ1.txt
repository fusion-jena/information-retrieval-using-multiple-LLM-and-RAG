In this study, the researchers collect relevant reviews with images from three different platforms - Weibo, Dianping, and Ctrip - for 57 traditional villages. After cleaning and removing irrelevant data, they obtain 3694 social media data entries with photographs. This suggests that the primary method used for collecting raw data in their deep learning pipeline involves gathering user-generated content from various online sources. However, it should be noted that the specifics regarding how the data was extracted or scraped from these platforms are not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
