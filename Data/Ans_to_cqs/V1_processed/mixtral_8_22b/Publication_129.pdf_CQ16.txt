Based on the provided context, there isn't any explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, common practices in machine learning include stopping training when the model's performance on a validation set stops improving, often referred to as early stopping or when the validation loss plateaus. Other methods may involve setting a fixed number of epochs or iterations, or manually inspecting the model's performance after each iteration. Without more specific details from the authors regarding their approach, we cannot provide a definitive answer.
