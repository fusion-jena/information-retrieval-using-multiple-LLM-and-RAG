The information provided does not explicitly mention where the data repositories of the deep learning pipelines are available. However, some studies have mentioned using datasets from specific organizations. For instance, R. Mohanty et al. (Mohanty et al., 2020) used a dataset containing the vocalizations of 14 different bird species, recorded by the Central Poultry Development Organization (CPDO) in Bhubaneswar, India. Unfortunately, no further details about the availability of this dataset were given. Similarly, K. W. Gunawan et al. (Gunawan et al., 2021) used a transfer learning technique to categorize endangered species, including the Indonesian scops owl, but did not provide any information regarding the source or accessibility of their dataset. Therefore, without additional context, I cannot determine where the data repositories of these deep learning pipelines are available.
