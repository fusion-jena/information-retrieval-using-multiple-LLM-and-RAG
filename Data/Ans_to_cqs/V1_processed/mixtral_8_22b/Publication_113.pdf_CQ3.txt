The given context does not provide explicit details about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, there are some indications regarding the process involved in training the models.

In the context, it mentions running a pre-trained detector model on images, which suggests that object detection might be one of the tasks being performed. Object detection often involves annotating images with bounding boxes around objects of interest. Additionally, the mention of 'crops' could imply that region cropping was applied to focus on relevant parts of the images.

Furthermore, the context discusses employing margin-based active learning, which is a technique where the model iteratively requests labels for the most uncertain instances. This implies that human annotators were likely involved in labeling the data during the active learning phase.

Lastly, the context refers to fine-tuning the network on the target dataset, suggesting that transfer learning was utilized. Transfer learning typically involves taking a pre-trained model and adapting it to a new task by continuing its training on a smaller, related dataset.

However, without additional context, it is impossible to definitively state what specific data annotation techniques were used in the deep learning pipeline.
