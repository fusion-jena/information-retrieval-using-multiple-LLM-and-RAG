To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, a diverse dataset was utilized, which included various environmental variables such as temperature, salinity, chlorophyll concentration, sea level anomaly, thermocline intensity, surface oxygen concentration, silicate levels, and more. This diversity in the dataset helped capture different aspects of the environment that could influence tuna catch rates. Secondly, a 5 x 10-fold cross-validation technique was employed during the training phase of the model. Cross-validation is a powerful preventive measure against overfitting, where the model learns the noise in the training data instead of the underlying pattern. By repeatedly partitioning the original sample into a training set to train the model and a test set to evaluate it, cross-validation provides a robust estimate of how well the model will perform on unseen data. Lastly, stratified sampling was likely applied when dividing the dataset into folds for cross-validation. Stratification ensures that each fold is a good representative of the whole dataset, maintaining the same proportions of classes or categories within each fold. These measures combined contribute to building a reliable and accurate deep learning model capable of making predictions about high and low tuna catches and absences in the study area.
