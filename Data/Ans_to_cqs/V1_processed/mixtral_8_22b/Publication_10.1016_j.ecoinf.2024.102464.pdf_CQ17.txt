The provided context does not directly mention any specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, some common regularization techniques include Dropout and L2 Regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to make the model more robust and prevents overfitting. This can be thought of as training a large number of neural networks with different architectures in parallel.

L2 Regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of all the weights in the network. This encourages smaller weights, leading to simpler models that generalize better.

Other regularization techniques include L1 Regularization, Early Stopping, and Data Augmentation. These methods help to improve the model's ability to generalize to new data and reduce overfitting.
