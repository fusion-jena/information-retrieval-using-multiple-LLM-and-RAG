To ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model, the authors employed various strategies. Firstly, they conducted a grid search to tune the hyperparameters of their model. This involved defining a range of potential values for each parameter based on prior knowledge and literature review, and exhaustively testing all possible combinations of these values. They used the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as the evaluation metric, aiming to minimize it to achieve the most accurate predictions. Through this process, they determined the optimal values for 'numberOfTrees','minLeafPopulation', 'bagFraction', and'seed'.

Secondly, they used a stratified random sampling approach to create their training and testing datasets. This involved randomly selecting half of the pixels for the training and testing split. However, unlike simple random sampling, stratified random sampling ensured that the training/testing dataset accurately represented the distribution of Above Ground Biomass (AGB) values within the LiDAR-derived AGB maps. This strategy was crucial in ensuring that the generated AGB maps were accurate and representative of the distribution of AGB values in the study area.

Lastly, they used cross-validation techniques during the grid search to evaluate the model's performance. Cross-validation involves dividing the original sample into a training set to train the model, and a validation set to validate the model. This helps prevent overfitting and ensures that the model can generalize well to new, unseen data.

In summary, the authors took several measures to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model. These included conducting a grid search to tune the model's hyperparameters, using a stratified random sampling approach to create diverse training and testing datasets, and employing cross-validation techniques during the grid search.
