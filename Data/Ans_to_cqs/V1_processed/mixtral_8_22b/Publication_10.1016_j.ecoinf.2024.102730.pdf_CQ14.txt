The hyperparameters of the model were optimized using a grid search approach. Specifically, the authors used the Optuna library for this purpose. They explored various ranges of hyperparameters including the number of neurons in the first and second layers, strength of the L2 regularization term, solver for weight optimization, initial learning rate, learning rate schedule for weight updates, maximum number of iterations, and maximum number of iterations with no improvement. After performing the grid search, the optimal values for these hyperparameters were identified for each of the three regression tasks. These optimal values are listed in Table 2.
