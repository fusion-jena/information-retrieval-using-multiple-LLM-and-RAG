The text does not explicitly state the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions that repeated training and testing are necessary to develop an optimal neural network and achieve high performance. This suggests that some form of iterative process is employed to evaluate the model's performance during training. Common criteria used to determine when training is complete include observing a plateau in the validation loss, achieving a predefined level of performance, or reaching a maximum number of training epochs. Without additional information, it cannot be definitively stated which of these criteria, if any, are being used in this particular case.
