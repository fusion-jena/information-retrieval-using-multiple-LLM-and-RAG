Based on the given information, it is not explicitly stated how the trained deep learning models were deployed after being constructed in R using H2O. However, common practices for deploying such models include model serialization or saving the model object, which can then be loaded into another environment or platform for making predictions. The choice of deployment strategy often depends on factors like computational resources, latency requirements, and integration with existing systems. Without more specific details about the study, it cannot be determined exactly what process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning models.
