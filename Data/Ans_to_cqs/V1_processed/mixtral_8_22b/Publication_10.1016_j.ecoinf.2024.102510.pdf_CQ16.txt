Training completion criteria vary depending on the specific problem and requirements. However, some common criteria include reaching a certain number of epochs or iterations, achieving a desired level of performance on a validation set, observing no further improvement in validation loss or accuracy over several epochs (i.e., a validation loss plateau), or meeting a predefined threshold for early stopping. In this study, the authors use a 60:40 split of training and testing data and evaluate their models based on validation accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. They do not explicitly mention any specific criterion for determining when training is complete, but one could infer that they may have stopped training once there were no significant improvements in these metrics.
