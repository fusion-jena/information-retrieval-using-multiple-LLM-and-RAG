Based on the given context, it appears that the model was trained using a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer with an initial learning rate of 0.01 and a cycle learning rate of 0.2. However, there is no explicit mention of how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, such as whether they used grid search, random search, or any other optimization technique. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, I cannot provide a definitive answer to how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized.
