The text does not provide specific information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. It mentions a suite of improvements and optimizations but does not detail whether these include techniques such as grid search or random search for hyperparameter optimization. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine the method used for hyperparameter optimization.
