The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the given context is primarily for classification tasks. These models have been employed for various applications such as plant leaf recognition, identifying plant species, and detecting diseases in crops. For instance, one study uses deep learning models for detecting diseases in single crop species, while another adapts VGG-16 and dimensionality reduction with ESPCA to classify thirty-two plant species. Additionally, ResNet-50 architecture was utilized to capture leaf feature patterns via fusion learning and trained on three benchmark datasets. Another research focused on proposing a Convolutional Neural Network model to identify plant species among five medicinal plants. Furthermore, a deep learning-based method was suggested to automate plant species classification in the Borneo region. Overall, the main objective of these deep learning models is to accurately classify and recognize specific features within images related to plant leaves, species, and diseases.
