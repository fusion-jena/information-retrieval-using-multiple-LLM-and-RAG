Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that bounding boxes were used for object detection or localization tasks based on the mention of "bounding boxes" in the first sentence. Bounding boxes are commonly used in computer vision tasks such as object detection and image segmentation to draw rectangles around objects of interest. In this case, they might have been used to identify and locate insects within images. Unfortunately, there is no further information regarding other potential data annotation techniques like instance segmentation or semantic segmentation.
