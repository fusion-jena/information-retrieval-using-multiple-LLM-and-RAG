The text does not provide explicit details about specific data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it mentions that the biggest challenge when dealing with weakly labeled samples of varying lengths is to extract segments of audio recordings that contain the target signal. To address this issue, a simple detector based on signal strength was developed to extract segments containing vocalizations from the recordings. This approach relies on morphological features to distinguish salient audio segments from background noise. In summary, while the document doesn't explicitly mention traditional data annotation techniques like bounding boxes or instance segmentation, it describes a method for identifying relevant sections within audio files by analyzing their signal strengths and morphological characteristics.
