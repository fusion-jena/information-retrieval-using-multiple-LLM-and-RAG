The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, it can be inferred that the model is used for binary classification. Specifically, a Random Forest (RF) binary classification model was developed to identify iceplant within Santa Barbara County coast vegetation. This model was then used to perform a per-pixel analysis of all NAIP scenes from 2020 over this region. Therefore, the primary purpose of the deep learning model appears to be classification, specifically identifying the presence or absence of iceplant in a given area.
