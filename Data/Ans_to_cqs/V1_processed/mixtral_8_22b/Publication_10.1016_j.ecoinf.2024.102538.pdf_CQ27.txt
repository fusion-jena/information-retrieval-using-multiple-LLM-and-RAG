Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available from the given context to provide a detailed explanation about how the trained deep learning model was deployed. Typically, after training a deep learning model, it can be saved or serialized so that its architecture and learned parameters are stored in a file. Later, this file can be loaded back into memory when needed. As for platform selection, depending on the application, the model could be deployed on various platforms like cloud services, edge devices, mobile applications, etc. However, without specific details regarding the deployment process used in this case, I cannot provide a precise answer.
