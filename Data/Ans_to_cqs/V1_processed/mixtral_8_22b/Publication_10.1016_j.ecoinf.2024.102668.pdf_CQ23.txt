The text does not provide explicit information on specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, it discusses the importance of addressing device bias when comparing ecological acoustical data from various recording devices. The authors propose a comprehensive processing pipeline to reduce this bias, making the data more suitable for broad comparative analyses and applicable to fields such as machine learning and deep learning.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach, they conducted inter-brand and intra-brand experiments with two types of recording devices â€“ SongMeters and AudioMoths. These devices had varying sampling frequencies (FS) and gain settings. While the exact number of recordings is not mentioned for each experiment, there were 1988 recordings for the inter-brand experiment and 203 recordings for the intra-brand experiment. This suggests that the researchers aimed to create a diverse dataset by including multiple brands and configurations of recording devices.

Although the text does not explicitly mention techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting, the focus on minimizing device bias can be seen as a step towards improving the robustness and generalizability of any subsequent deep learning models trained on the processed data. By ensuring consistency in feature spaces regardless of the recording device used, the proposed methodology aims to improve the applicability of ecoacoustic indices to emerging fields like machine learning and deep learning.
