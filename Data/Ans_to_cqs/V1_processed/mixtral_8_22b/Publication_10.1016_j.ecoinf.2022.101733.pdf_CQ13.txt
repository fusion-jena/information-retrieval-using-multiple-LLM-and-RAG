The given context does not provide specific information regarding the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the type of optimizer employed. However, it mentions that an optimizer approach was utilized for feature selection and optimizing SVM parameters based on a robust system architecture. This suggests that some form of optimization technique was applied during the development of the model; however, without further details, it is impossible to determine the exact hyperparameters used.
