The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that various methods such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets could potentially be employed depending on the application. For instance, in the study by Zhang et al. (2023), they might have collected water quality indicator data using sensors installed within the wastewater treatment plants. Similarly, in the research conducted by Zheng and Jia (2022), they may have gathered soil heat flux data through remote sensing observations. Nevertheless, without explicit information regarding the data collection process, these assumptions remain speculative.
