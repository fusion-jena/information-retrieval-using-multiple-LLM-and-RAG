The provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it mentions several optimization techniques used in developing a lightweight SIAlex model for bird voice recognition. These include merging a single convolution layer with a single batch normalization (BN) layer, accelerating network convergence, preventing overfitting, solving gradient disappearance and explosion issues, and improving forward inference speed by merging BN layer parameters into a convolution layer. While these methods do not directly address randomness management, they contribute to enhancing the overall performance and efficiency of the deep learning model.
