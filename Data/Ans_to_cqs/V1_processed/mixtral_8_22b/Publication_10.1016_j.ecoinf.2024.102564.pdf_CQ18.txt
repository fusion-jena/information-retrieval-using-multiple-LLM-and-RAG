Based on the given information, it appears that the study uses several machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Random Forest (RF) for modeling net growth in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. However, there is no explicit mention of a specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training.

Nevertheless, we can infer some general strategies based on common practices in machine learning. For instance, one common approach is to use cross-validation, where the dataset is divided into training and validation sets. During training, the model's performance is evaluated using the validation set after each epoch or iteration. This helps prevent overfitting and provides insights into how well the model is learning from the data.

Additionally, metrics like Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), correlation coefficient (r), and bias are often used to evaluate the performance of the models. These metrics provide quantitative measures of the accuracy and precision of the predictions made by the models.

Therefore, while the exact strategy employed in this particular study remains unclear, these general approaches could have been utilized to monitor the model performance during training.
