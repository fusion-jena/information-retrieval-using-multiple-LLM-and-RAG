Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific optimization techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that the models were trained for several epochs, which suggests some form of gradient descent optimization technique was likely employed. Additionally, the use of transfer learning indicates that pre-trained weights might have been utilized, possibly optimized using these techniques beforehand. But without further information, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the exact optimization techniques used in this case.
