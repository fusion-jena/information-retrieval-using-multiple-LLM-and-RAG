In the given context, there is only one explicit mention of a regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. This method is called Dropout, which is applied to the fully connected layer of the neural network. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent overfitting by making the network more robust and reducing its reliance on any single neuron.

While not explicitly mentioned in the context, another common regularization method used in deep learning pipelines is L2 Regularization, also known as weight decay. This method involves adding a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the sum of squares of all the weights in the network. By doing so, it encourages smaller weights, leading to simpler models that generalize better and are less prone to overfitting.

Other regularization techniques include early stopping, data augmentation, and batch normalization. Early stopping involves monitoring the validation error while training and halting the process once the error starts increasing, indicating that the model might be starting to overfit. Data augmentation generates additional training examples by applying random transformations to existing ones, effectively expanding the dataset and helping the model learn more invariant representations. Lastly, batch normalization standardizes the inputs to each layer, improving convergence speed and reducing overfitting by acting as a form of regularization.
