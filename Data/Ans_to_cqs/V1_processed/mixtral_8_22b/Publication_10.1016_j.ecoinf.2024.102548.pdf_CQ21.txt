After the completion of model training, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the nature of the problem and the desired insights. Here are some common postprocessing techniques:

1. Saliency Maps: Saliency maps help visualize which parts of the input image contribute most significantly towards the final prediction made by the model. They highlight areas where the model focuses its attention during decision making.

2. Metrics Calculation: Evaluating the performance of the trained model is crucial. Common metrics include Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Area Under Curve (AUC), etc. These metrics provide insight into how well the model has learned from the given data.

3. Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix is used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. It provides detailed information about actual vs predicted classes. From this matrix, we can calculate various metrics like precision, recall, F1 score, etc.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning: Post-training, hyperparameters may need tuning to improve model performance. Techniques like Grid Search, Random Search, Bayesian Optimization, etc., can be employed for this purpose.

5. Ensemble Methods: Combining multiple models to create an ensemble can often lead to improved results. Techniques like bagging, boosting, stacking, etc., can be utilized for creating ensembles.

6. Model Interpretability: Explaining why a model makes certain decisions is important for understanding its behavior. Techniques like LIME, SHAP, Anchors, etc., can be used to interpret black box models.
