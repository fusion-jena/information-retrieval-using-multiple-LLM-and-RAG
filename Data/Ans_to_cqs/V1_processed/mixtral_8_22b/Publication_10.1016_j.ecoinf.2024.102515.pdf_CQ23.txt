Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the researchers used diverse datasets based on the three different criteria mentioned for performing the tweet search through the API. These include tweets where users ask 'who knows' or 'if anyone knows', tweets asking 'what is this', and tweets where users claim to have found something. Additionally, different verb tenses and the use of both singular and plural forms were also considered. While these steps suggest efforts towards creating a diverse dataset, there is no direct reference to techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting for improving the model's performance and ensuring its generalizability.
