Before training a deep learning model, various preprocessing steps are often applied to the input data. These steps aim to improve the quality and consistency of the data, making it easier for the model to learn meaningful patterns. Some common preprocessing techniques include:

1. Normalization or standardization: This involves rescaling the features so they have zero mean and unit variance, or transforming them to lie within a specific range (e.g., between 0 and 1). This helps ensure that no single feature dominates the others during training due to differences in scale.

2. Cleaning and handling missing values: Removing noise, outliers, or irrelevant information from the dataset can help prevent overfitting and improve model performance. Missing values can be handled using methods such as imputation (filling in missing values with estimates), deletion (removing rows or columns containing missing values), or encoding (representing missingness explicitly in the data).

3. Feature engineering: Creating new features or modifying existing ones can sometimes lead to improved model performance. Examples include polynomial expansion, binning, or extracting features from raw data (e.g., image pixels or text tokens).

4. Data augmentation: Generating additional synthetic samples through transformations (e.g., rotations, translations, or flips) can increase the size of the dataset and help reduce overfitting.

5. Encoding categorical variables: Converting categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding or ordinal encoding) allows them to be processed by neural networks.
