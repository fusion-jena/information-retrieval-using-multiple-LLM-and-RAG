The given context does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the model is called BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and was pretrained by Devlin et al. (2018). The paper describing this model can be found here: <https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805>. In this paper, the authors describe the architecture and training process of BERT, including details about the hyperparameters they used. For example, they mention that they used Adam optimization with a learning rate of 1e-4, a batch size of 256, and a maximum sequence length of 512 tokens. They also discuss other aspects of the model such as its use of masked language modeling and next sentence prediction during pretraining.
