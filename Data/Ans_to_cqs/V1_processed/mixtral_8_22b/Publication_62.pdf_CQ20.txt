The deep learning models were trained using NVIDIA K80 GPUs. This information is mentioned in the text where it states, "CNNs were built in Mathematica version 11.1 (Wolfram Research Inc.) and trained on NVIDIA K80 GPUs." Therefore, the hardware resource used for training the deep learning model was NVIDIA K80 GPUs.
