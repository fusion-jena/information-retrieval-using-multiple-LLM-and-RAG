Based on the given context, it appears that there isn't explicit information about specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning prior to training the deep learning model. However, we can infer some general preprocessing steps based on common practices in deep learning applications.

Before feeding the multi-view data of WT spectrum, HHT spectrum, and STFT spectrum into the CNN pre-training models, it is likely that these spectral representations were generated from raw audio signals using techniques like Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Hilbert Huang Transform (HHT), Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT), etc. These transformations convert time domain signals into frequency domain representations, which can be more informative for certain tasks like sound event detection or bird species identification.

Additionally, since the dataset was split into training and testing sets with an 8:2 ratio, it implies that the data might have been shuffled beforehand to ensure randomness during splitting. This step helps prevent any potential biases due to ordering effects in the original dataset.

Although not explicitly mentioned, it is also possible that the authors performed standardization or normalization on their input features to bring them to a similar scale. This practice often improves the convergence rate and overall performance of deep learning models by making the optimization landscape smoother.

Lastly, while not directly related to preprocessing, the use of a Dropout layer in the fully connected layer suggests that the authors employed regularization techniques to mitigate overfitting and enhance the model's ability to generalize well to unseen data.

To summarize, although the exact preprocessing steps aren't detailed in the provided context, one could reasonably assume that the following steps may have been taken: generating spectral representations from raw audio signals, shuffling the dataset, applying standardization/normalization, and incorporating regularization methods like Dropout.
