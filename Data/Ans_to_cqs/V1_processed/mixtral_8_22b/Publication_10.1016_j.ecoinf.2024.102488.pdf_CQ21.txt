After the model training, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the project or research. Some common postprocessing steps include:

1. Model evaluation metrics: Calculating various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, etc., to evaluate the performance of the trained model. These metrics help in understanding how well the model has learned from the given data and its ability to generalize to unseen data.

2. Confusion Matrix: It is a table layout that allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm. Each row of the matrix represents the instances in an actual class while each column represents the instances in a predicted class. This helps in identifying which classes are being misclassified more often.

3. Saliency Maps: They are visualizations that highlight the pixels in the input image that contribute most strongly to the output of a convolutional neural network. This helps in understanding what parts of the input image are important for making predictions.

In this particular case, after the model training, the authors have evaluated the fusion quality using different base models and meta-models. They have also used Recursive Feature Elimination and Cross-Validation (RFECV) for feature selection. However, they do not explicitly mention any postprocessing steps like saliency maps or confusion matrices. Therefore, it cannot be said if these techniques were used in their analysis.
