The paper by C. Meng et al. does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in their deep learning pipeline. However, based on Table 1, it can be inferred that they use publicly available datasets such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Night Time Light (NTL), and Net Primary Productivity (NPP). These datasets are sourced from various platforms like <https://www.resdc.cn/>, <https://www.tpdc.ac.cn/>, and <https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/>. It is also possible that other methods such as remote sensing or satellite imagery were employed, given the references to Moortgat et al.'s work on using commercial satellite imagery for river classification and Nicholls et al.'s research on deltas in the Anthropocene. Nonetheless, without explicit information about the data collection process, this remains speculative.
