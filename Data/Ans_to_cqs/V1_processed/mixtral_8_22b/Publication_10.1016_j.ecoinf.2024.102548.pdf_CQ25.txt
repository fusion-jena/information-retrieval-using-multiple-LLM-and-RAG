Based on the given context, the purpose of the deep learning models discussed in this study is not explicitly stated. However, considering the common applications of these models, we can infer that they might be used for image classification tasks. Specifically, both ResNet-50 and InceptionV3 have demonstrated excellent performance in various image classification tasks. Additionally, the evaluation of model performance mentioned in the context is based on the accuracy metric, which is commonly used for assessing the effectiveness of classification models. Therefore, while the exact purpose of the deep learning models in this study is not specified, it can be reasonably assumed that their primary function is image classification.
