Unfortunately, there isn't enough context provided to determine what specific process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. Typically, after training a deep learning model, the next steps would involve saving or serializing the model, selecting a suitable deployment platform, and then integrating the saved model into the chosen platform. However, without more details about the specific case, it's not possible to provide a precise answer.
