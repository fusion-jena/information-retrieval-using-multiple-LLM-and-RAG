In the given context, the authors have implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) called U-Net for biomedical image segmentation. This specific implementation of CNN was first introduced by Ronneberger et al. [19]. The U-Net architecture consists of two main paths - an encoding path and a decoding path. The encoding path is responsible for capturing the contextual information, while the decoding path enables precise localization. Each encoding block within the encoding path contains a convolutional layer with a filter size of (3, 3), followed by a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function, a dropout layer, another convolutional layer with ReLU activation, and finally a max pooling layer with a size of (2, 2). The decoding path mirrors the structure of the encoding path but replaces the max pooling layers with upsampling layers. Therefore, the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a CNN, specifically the U-Net architecture.
