The study primarily focuses on using deep learning models for detecting alates on sorghum leaves. Based on the given information, it is clear that the authors use image datasets for their research. Specifically, they mention using images at input resolutions of 640 x 640 pixels and 1280 x 1280 pixels. They also discuss training five different versions of the YOLOv5 model family, which is known for object detection tasks in images. Furthermore, they reference the Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset, which is a popular benchmark dataset for image recognition tasks. Given this context, it can be concluded that the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is images.
