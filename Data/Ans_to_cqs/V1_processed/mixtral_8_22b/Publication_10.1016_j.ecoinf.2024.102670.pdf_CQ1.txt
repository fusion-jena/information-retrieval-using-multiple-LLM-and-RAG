The text does not provide explicit information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, one example mentioned is utilizing crowd-sourcing for obtaining manual annotations, which was demonstrated by Sharma et al. (2017). This approach involves non-expert users for gathering ground truth data, specifically for karyotyping images of chromosomes. Additionally, the use of public datasets like those referenced in Table 7 could also serve as sources of raw data for deep learning models. These datasets may have been collected through various means such as surveys, sensors, or other forms of data collection.
