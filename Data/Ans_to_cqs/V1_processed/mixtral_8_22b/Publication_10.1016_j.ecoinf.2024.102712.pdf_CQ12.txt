The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it mentions the use of remote sensing data and modeling frameworks for estimating aboveground biomass density. In this regard, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly employed for processing satellite imagery and extracting relevant features for various applications, including biomass estimation. Therefore, while there isn't direct evidence, it can be speculated that a CNN might have been utilized in the pipeline based on its prevalence in similar tasks.
