The sources of raw data used in the deep learning pipeline vary depending on the specific application or research field. For instance, in the case of water quality prediction, Khullar and Singh (2022), Prasad et al. (2021), Wai et al. (2022), and Zheng et al. (2023) use data collected over an extended period. While the exact methods for data collection are not explicitly mentioned in the given context, one could infer that they might involve physical measurements from water samples, sensor readings, or even satellite imagery.

In the realm of biomonitoring, specifically with regards to the swimming behavior of C. elegans, Jeong et al. (2019) propose a biological monitoring method based on the response behavior of C. elegans to chemicals in water. This suggests that their data collection process likely involves observing and recording the organisms' reactions to different water conditions. Similarly, Cho et al. (2014) discuss learning phrase representations using RNN encoder-decoder for statistical machine translation, which implies the utilization of textual data.

Moreover, Concepcion et al. (2023) introduce BivalveNet, a hybrid deep neural network for common cockle (Cerastoderma edule) geographical traceability based on shell image analysis. This indicates that their raw data consists of images of shells, possibly captured through digital photography or scanning techniques. Lastly, Dehghani et al. (2024) employ deep learning tools to map and monitor biological soil crusts, suggesting the use of remote sensing data or ground-based observations.

In summary, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline span across various domains and include physical measurements, sensor readings, satellite imagery, observation and recording of organism responses, textual data, and image capture.
