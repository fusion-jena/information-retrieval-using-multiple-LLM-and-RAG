Unfortunately, based on the given information, there isn't any explicit mention of where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it can be inferred that since the text mentions a'repository', it might be hosted on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Additionally, the reference to a README.md file suggests that the repository could potentially follow a standard structure used in version control systems like Git. Therefore, I would recommend checking popular repositories related to the SMARTLAGOON project or searching for keywords mentioned in the context, such as 'SMARTLAGOON' or'satellite data collection tool,' on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
