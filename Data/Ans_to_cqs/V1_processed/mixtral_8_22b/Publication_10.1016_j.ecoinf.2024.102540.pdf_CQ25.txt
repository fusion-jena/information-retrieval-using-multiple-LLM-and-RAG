The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is object detection. Specifically, it refers to the You Only Look Once (YOLO) family of models, which are state-of-the-art, single-stage detector models built on the PyTorch machine learning framework. These models are designed to detect objects within images, and they come in five different versions - nano (n), small (s), medium (m), large (l), and extra-large (x) - each varying in complexity, number of layers, and parameters. The primary goal of these models is to accurately locate and classify objects within images quickly and efficiently.
