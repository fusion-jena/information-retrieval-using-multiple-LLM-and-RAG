The text does not explicitly mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. However, it does provide information about the use of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) in the process.

Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is a generative model that combines deep learning techniques with Bayesian inference. It consists of an encoder and a decoder, both typically composed of multiple layers of artificial neurons. The encoder transforms the input data into a lower-dimensional latent space, while the decoder attempts to reconstruct the original input from this latent representation.

In this case, the VAE is employed to map the input data to a posterior density over the latent variables. The encoder neural network approximates the true posterior density with a multivariate Gaussian, while the decoder reconstructs the input data from the latent variable. The optimization objective of the VAE includes two competing terms: the reconstruction loss and the regularization term.

Although the text does not specify whether the encoder and decoder components of the VAE utilize convolutional, recurrent, or other types of layers, it does mention that the encoder consists of nine fully connected layers, and the decoder comprises ten fully connected layers. This suggests that the VAE might employ feedforward neural networks rather than convolutional or recurrent architectures. Nonetheless, without explicit confirmation, we cannot definitively state the exact type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
