Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific information on the exact metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the best model is selected based on the comparison of performance scores obtained from different combinations of hyperparameters. This suggests that some form of performance metric was indeed used during the evaluation process. Common metrics used to assess the performance of deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, and area under the curve (AUC), among others. These metrics help quantify how well the model performs in predicting the desired output. Without further details, it cannot be definitively stated which specific metrics were employed in this particular study.
