The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed, such as reaching a validation loss plateau. However, it can be inferred from the text that some form of cross-validation was employed during the training process. Specifically, four folds were used for internal cross-validation during model training, while setting aside one fold for external evaluation. This suggests that the training process may involve assessing the model's performance on unseen data (i.e., the validation set) and adjusting the model accordingly until satisfactory results are achieved. Nonetheless, without explicit information regarding the stopping criterion, it cannot be definitively stated what exact metric or threshold was used to determine when training was complete.
