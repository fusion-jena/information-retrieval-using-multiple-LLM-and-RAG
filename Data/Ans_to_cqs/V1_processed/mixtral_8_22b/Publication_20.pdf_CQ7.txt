The text does not explicitly mention how the data was split into training, testing, and validation sets. However, it can be inferred that the authors used at least 2200 thumbnails per fish species class for training purposes. Additionally, the authors mentioned stopping the network training after 70 epochs to prevent overfitting, indicating that they might have used a separate validation set during training. Unfortunately, no specific information about the size or composition of the validation and testing sets is available based on the provided context.
