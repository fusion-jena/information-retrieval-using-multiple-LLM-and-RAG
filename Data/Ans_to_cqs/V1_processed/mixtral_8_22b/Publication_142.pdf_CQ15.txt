The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it does provide some information about the deep learning process used in developing the Pl@ntNet classification tool.

The text mentions that the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) used in Pl@ntNet is based on the Inception model, which is then fine-tuned using Pl@ntNet data after being pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. This suggests that transfer learning, a common optimization technique in deep learning, might be employed here. Transfer learning involves leveraging knowledge gained from solving one problem and applying it to another related problem.

Moreover, the text also highlights the importance of having high-quality and balanced training datasets for achieving good performance in real conditions. This implies that strategies for handling unbalanced or biased datasets could potentially be part of the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

However, without explicit mention of optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam in the provided context, I cannot definitively state what optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline.
