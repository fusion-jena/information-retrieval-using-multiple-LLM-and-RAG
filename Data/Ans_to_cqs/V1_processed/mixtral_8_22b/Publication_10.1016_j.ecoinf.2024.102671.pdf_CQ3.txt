The given context does not provide specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, generally speaking, there are several common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines such as bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation.

Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest in images or videos. This technique is commonly used for object detection tasks. Semantic segmentation involves labeling every pixel in an image with its corresponding class label. Instance segmentation is similar to semantic segmentation but also differentiates individual instances of the same class. These techniques help train deep learning models to recognize patterns and make predictions based on input data.

Without further context, it cannot be determined if these specific techniques were used in the research presented in the given context. It would require additional information regarding the specific deep learning pipeline employed in the study to accurately determine which data annotation techniques were utilized.
