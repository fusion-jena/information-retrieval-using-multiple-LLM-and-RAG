Unfortunately, there isn't enough context provided to determine which specific frameworks are used to build the deep learning model. However, popular frameworks for building deep learning models include TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and Caffe. These frameworks provide tools and libraries to help developers create, train, and deploy machine learning models. Without further details about the specific application or use case, I cannot recommend one over another. Please provide additional context if available so I can give a more accurate response.
