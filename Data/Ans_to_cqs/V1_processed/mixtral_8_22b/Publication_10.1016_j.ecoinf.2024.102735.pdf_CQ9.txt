The information regarding the availability or location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given references is not explicitly stated. Therefore, it cannot be determined from these sources alone where the data repository might be located. It could potentially be found within one of the cited papers or their supplementary materials, but this would require further investigation into each individual paper.

Unhelpful 
The data repository for the deep learning pipeline can be found on GitHub.

This response is incorrect because there is no mention of GitHub in any of the provided references, so we cannot confirm that the data repository is hosted there.
