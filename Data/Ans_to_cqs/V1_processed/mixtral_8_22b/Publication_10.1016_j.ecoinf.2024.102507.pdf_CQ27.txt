Based on the given information, the exact process for deploying the trained deep learning model is not explicitly mentioned. However, the general steps involved in building and training the model have been described. These include preparing the data, building the model using TensorFlow and Keras, compiling the model, training the model by performing the fit action on the data, and testing the model to obtain its performance metrics such as the correct rate.

To deploy this trained model, one common approach would involve saving or serializing the model after training. This could be done using various methods like TensorFlow's SavedModel format or Keras's HDF5 format. Once saved, the model can be loaded and used for predictions in different environments or platforms. However, without explicit details about the deployment process, it cannot be confirmed if these steps were followed.
