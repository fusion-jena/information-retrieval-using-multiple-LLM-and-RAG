Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to provide a specific dataset used in the deep learning pipeline for modeling net growth in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. However, I can tell you that common datasets used in deep learning pipelines include MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet. These datasets are often used for image classification tasks. MNIST contains handwritten digits, CIFAR consists of small natural images, and ImageNet is a large-scale dataset containing millions of labeled images. Again, without more context, it cannot be confirmed if any of these datasets were used in the study mentioned.
