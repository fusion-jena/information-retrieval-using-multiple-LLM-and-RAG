The context does not provide specific details about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as train, test, and validation sets. However, it mentions that the batch size was set to 16 uniformly across all networks. In general, when splitting data for deep learning models, common practices include randomly dividing the dataset into three subsets: training, testing, and validation. The training set is used to fit the model, while the testing set evaluates its performance. The validation set helps tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. The proportion of each subset varies depending on the dataset size and problem requirements but often ranges from 70-80% for training, 10-15% for testing, and 10-15% for validation.
