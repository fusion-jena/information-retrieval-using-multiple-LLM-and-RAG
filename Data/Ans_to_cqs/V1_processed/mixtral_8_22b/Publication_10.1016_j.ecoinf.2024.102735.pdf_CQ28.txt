Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to determine which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. The context mentions various studies and papers related to harmful algal bloom (HAB) prediction using data-driven models and machine learning techniques like Random Forest, Multilayer Perceptron, Long Short Term Memory, Support Vector Regression, and Deep Learning. However, it does not provide any details about the deployment platforms or cloud services used for these models. Therefore, without additional information, we cannot accurately determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
