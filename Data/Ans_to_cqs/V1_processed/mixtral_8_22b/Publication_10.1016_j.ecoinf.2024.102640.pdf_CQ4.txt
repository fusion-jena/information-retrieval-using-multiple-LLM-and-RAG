Unfortunately, there isn't any information about specific data augmentation techniques used in the given context. However, some common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, and color jittering. These techniques help improve the robustness and generalizability of models by increasing the diversity of training data without collecting new images or labels.
