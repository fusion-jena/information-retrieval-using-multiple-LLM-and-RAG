To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes within each set. This ensures that the classifier learns from a representative sample of all classes, reducing any potential bias towards certain classes.

Oversampling is a technique where synthetic samples are created from the minority class to balance the dataset. This helps prevent the classifier from being biased towards the majority class due to their higher representation in the dataset.

Undersampling, on the other hand, involves removing instances from the majority class until both classes have equal representation. While this may result in loss of information, it can help reduce bias towards the majority class.

Diverse data collection involves gathering data from different sources and environments to ensure that the dataset is representative of real-world scenarios. This can help mitigate any potential bias introduced by using only one source of data.

In summary, addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline requires careful consideration of the dataset's characteristics and employing appropriate techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.
