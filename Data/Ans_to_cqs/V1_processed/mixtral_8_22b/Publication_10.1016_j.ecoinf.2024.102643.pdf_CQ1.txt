The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that various sources such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets could potentially be used based on common practices in similar fields. For instance, the paper by Busby (1991) discusses a bioclimatic analysis and prediction system called BIOCLIM, which might involve using climate data collected through sensors or satellite imagery. Similarly, the study by Carvalho et al. mentions environmental layers, suggesting the use of geospatial data, possibly obtained from remote sensing technologies or publicly available databases like WorldClim. Lastly, the research conducted by O.E. and colleagues (2004, 2014) focuses on bear populations and human-bear conflicts, implying the potential use of field observations, surveys, or existing wildlife databases. Nevertheless, without explicit information regarding the data collection methods employed in these studies, one cannot definitively state what techniques were used for gathering raw data in their respective deep learning pipelines.
