The text does not provide information about the use of any specific deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers in the pipeline. Instead, it discusses the integration of previously mentioned models into a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) framework. CARTs are based on a divide-and-conquer strategy, where the data space is divided into subsets defined by the decision rules of a bifurcating tree. The inner nodes of the tree, also known as decision nodes, compare the values of selected input variables against certain decision thresholds. Regularization techniques are employed to prevent overfitting. Additionally, the text mentions the use of Random Forests (RBF-GFR-RF) and XGBoost, but these are not considered deep learning models.
