In the given context, it is mentioned that stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is used as a learning algorithm for training deep learning models. However, there is no explicit mention of other optimization techniques being applied in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, based solely on the provided information, it cannot be determined if any other optimization techniques besides SGD are utilized in this particular case.
