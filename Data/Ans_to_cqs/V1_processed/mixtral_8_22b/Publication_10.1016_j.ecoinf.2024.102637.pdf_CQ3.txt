The given context does not provide explicit information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge, some common data annotation techniques used in deep learning include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and landmark annotation. These techniques help label the dataset with relevant information required for training machine learning or deep learning algorithms. For example, bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest within images, which helps train object detection models. Semantic segmentation involves assigning each pixel in an image to a particular class, enabling the creation of detailed maps of scenes. Instance segmentation combines both object detection and semantic segmentation, allowing individual instances of objects to be identified and labeled separately. Polygon annotation involves outlining complex shapes within images, useful for tasks like autonomous driving. Key point annotation involves marking specific points on objects, often used for pose estimation or facial recognition. Landmark annotation involves identifying specific features within images, commonly used for face alignment or tracking. In summary, various data annotation techniques exist, depending on the task requirements and desired output.
