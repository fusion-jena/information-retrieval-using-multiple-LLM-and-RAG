Based on the information provided, it appears that the table does not explicitly list the hyperparameters typically associated with deep learning models such as learning rate, optimizer, batch size, etc. However, there are some parameters listed that could potentially be considered hyperparameters for the deep learning models used. These include 'Nrounds','max_depth', 'Eta', 'Gamma', 'colsample_bytree','min_child_weight', 'Subsample', 'Mtry', 'Size', 'Decay', 'layer1', 'layer2', 'layer3', 'hidden_dropout', and 'visible_dropout'. It is important to note that without additional context or clarification, it cannot be definitively stated which of these parameters are specific to the deep learning models and what their exact roles are within those models. Therefore, while I can provide a list of potential hyperparameters based on the given information, further details would be needed to confirm their relevance and function within the deep learning models used.
