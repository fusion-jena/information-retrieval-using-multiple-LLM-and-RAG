The given context does not provide information about specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it discusses various aspects of using machine learning and deep learning models for predicting harmful algal bloom indicators like chlorophyll-a. It also mentions the use of Random Forest (RF) models and other ML algorithms like Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Support Vector Regression (SVR) for this purpose. Additionally, the text highlights the importance of considering uncertainty in these predictions and provides references to relevant studies on this topic.
