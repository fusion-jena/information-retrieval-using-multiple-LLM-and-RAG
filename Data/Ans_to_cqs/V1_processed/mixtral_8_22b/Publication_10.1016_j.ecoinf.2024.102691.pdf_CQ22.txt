The performance of the deep learning models was evaluated using various evaluation matrices such as precision, recall, and average precision (AP) at different Intersection Over Union (IoU) thresholds. The Average Precision (AP) at 50% IoU, denoted by AP0.5, provides a more balanced reflection of the global detection performance of the model. Other metrics used include Precision, Recall, and F1 score. The evaluation metrics for each model on the validation set were calculated after 300 epochs.
