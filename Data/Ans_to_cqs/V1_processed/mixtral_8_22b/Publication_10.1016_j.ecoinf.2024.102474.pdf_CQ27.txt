Unfortunately, based on the given information, it is not possible to determine what specific process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The text does not provide any details about how the model was deployed after being trained. It only mentions that the model was trained on a NVIDIA GTX 1080 GPU and that the optimization was stopped once the validation score repeatedly failed to improve compared to previous epochs. However, there are no further details regarding the deployment process such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, without additional information, it is impossible to accurately answer this query.
