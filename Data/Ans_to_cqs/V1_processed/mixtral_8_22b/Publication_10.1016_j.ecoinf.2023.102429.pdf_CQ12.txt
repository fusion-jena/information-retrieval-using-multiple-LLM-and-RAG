The information provided does not explicitly mention the use of a specific deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers in the pipeline. Therefore, it cannot be determined which type of deep learning model is being used based solely on this context.
