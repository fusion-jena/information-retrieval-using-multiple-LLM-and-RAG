The pipeline uses a type of deep learning model called Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This is evident from several references made throughout the text. For instance, the mention of "feature maps" and "convolution operations" directly points towards the use of CNNs. Furthermore, specific architectures such as ResNet18, ResNet34, and ResNet152 are mentioned, which are all variants of CNNs. Additionally, the paper cites sources related to CNNs, including one titled "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): A Review," further supporting the conclusion that CNNs are the primary deep learning model used in the pipeline.
