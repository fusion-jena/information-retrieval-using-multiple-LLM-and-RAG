The DeepLabV3+ algorithm was built using the PyTorch library, specifically version 1.12.1. This indicates that PyTorch is the primary framework utilized for developing the deep learning model in this investigation. No other frameworks such as TensorFlow are mentioned in the given context. Therefore, it can be concluded that only PyTorch is used to build the deep learning model.
