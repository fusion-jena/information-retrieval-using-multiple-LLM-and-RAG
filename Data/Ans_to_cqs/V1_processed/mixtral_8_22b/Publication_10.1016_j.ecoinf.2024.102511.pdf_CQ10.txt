The provided sources do not contain information about the specific code repository link of the deep learning pipeline used for bioacoustic classification. However, one source mentions the use of PAMpal, which is a package available on CRAN (<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/PAMpal/index.html>). This package might include some relevant code or resources related to the topic. Additionally, another source cites a paper by Stowell (2022) titled "Computational bioacoustics with deep learning: a review and roadmap," which could provide further insights into the use of deep learning pipelines for bioacoustic classification. Unfortunately, without more specific details from the given sources, it is impossible to determine the exact code repository link for the deep learning pipeline being used.
