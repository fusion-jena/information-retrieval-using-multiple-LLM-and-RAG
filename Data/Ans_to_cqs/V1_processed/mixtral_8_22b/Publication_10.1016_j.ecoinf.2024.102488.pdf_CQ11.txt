Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about the data repository link of any deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is impossible to determine the specific link requested in the query. However, the context mentions that the GF-1 multispectral images used in the study were retrieved from the China Centre for Resources Satellite Data and Application (<https://data.cresda.cn>). This could be considered as a potential source of relevant data related to the research topic. Nevertheless, without further details regarding the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the query, it is not possible to provide a precise answer.
