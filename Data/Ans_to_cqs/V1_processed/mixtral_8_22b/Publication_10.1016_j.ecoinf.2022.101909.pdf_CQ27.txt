Unfortunately, based on the given information, there isn't enough detail about the specific steps taken to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, generally speaking, after training a deep learning model like ResNet50, it would typically involve some form of model serialization where the learned weights and biases are saved into a file format that can later be loaded back into memory for use in predictions. This serialized model can then be deployed onto various platforms depending on the application requirements. For example, if real-time predictions are needed, the model might be deployed onto edge devices or embedded systems. Alternatively, if large scale batch processing is required, cloud computing services may be used instead. Without further details though, I cannot provide a more precise response regarding the deployment process for this specific model.
