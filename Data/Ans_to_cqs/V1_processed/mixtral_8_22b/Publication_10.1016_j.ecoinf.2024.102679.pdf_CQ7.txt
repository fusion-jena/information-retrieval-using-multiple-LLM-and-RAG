Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into sets such as train, test, or validation. However, it does indicate that a validation set was used during the training process to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the details and noise in the training data to the extent that it negatively impacts its ability to generalize from new examples. By evaluating the model's performance on a separate validation set, the researchers could select the model with the best performance on unseen data, thus minimizing the risk of overfitting. While this doesn't provide explicit criteria for splitting the data, it suggests that the researchers likely followed common practices in machine learning, such as randomly dividing their dataset into training, validation, and possibly testing sets.
