The pipeline uses a deep learning model called CNNFAST, which is based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This network consists of two convolution layers (Conv1 and Conv2), both followed by a max pooling layer (Max Pool1 and Max Pool2), and ending with a fully connected layer with 64 units (Fully Connect). The CNNFAST network computes feature maps across the entire input spectrogram, resulting in less computation and a much faster runtime.
