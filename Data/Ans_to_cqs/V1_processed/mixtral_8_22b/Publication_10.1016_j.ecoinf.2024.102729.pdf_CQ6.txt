Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be taken to ensure optimal performance. These may include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing or correcting any inconsistencies, errors, or missing values within the dataset. It also includes handling outliers which might affect the model's performance.

2. Normalization or Standardization: Deep learning models often perform better when input features are scaled to a similar range. Normalization scales the data between 0 and 1, while standardization transforms the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

3. Feature Selection: Not all features contribute equally to the prediction task. Selecting relevant features not only reduces computational complexity but also improves model accuracy. Techniques such as correlation matrix, mutual information, or even domain knowledge can help select important features.

4. Encoding Categorical Features: Deep learning models cannot handle categorical variables directly. Therefore, these need to be converted into numerical form using encoding schemes like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

5. Data Augmentation: To increase the size of the dataset and prevent overfitting, synthetic samples can be created from existing ones via operations like rotation, zooming, flipping etc. However, this step is typically applied to image datasets.
