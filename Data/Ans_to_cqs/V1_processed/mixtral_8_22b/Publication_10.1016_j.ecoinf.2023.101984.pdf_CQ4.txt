The given context does not provide information on the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data augmentation techniques for image classification tasks include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, zooming, and shearing. These techniques help increase the size of the training dataset and improve the generalization performance of the model by introducing variations into the input images.
