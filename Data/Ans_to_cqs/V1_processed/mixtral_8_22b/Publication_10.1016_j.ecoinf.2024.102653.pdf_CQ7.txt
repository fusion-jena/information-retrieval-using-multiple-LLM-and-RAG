The data was split into training and validation sets using a ratio of 70% for training and 30% for validation. This division was carried out through random selection. Additionally, the train_test_split function from the scikit-learn library was employed to further divide the data into distinct training and testing subsets. In this case, 70% of the data was allocated for training the classification model, while the remaining 30% was reserved for testing. It is important to note that individuals from the control and pesticide-exposed groups were evenly distributed between these subsets to ensure a balanced representation of each class.
