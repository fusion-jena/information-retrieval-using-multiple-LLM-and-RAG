The given context does not provide specific details about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some commonly used techniques to handle data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets or strata based on certain criteria such as class labels, ensuring each subset has roughly the same distribution of classes. This technique helps maintain the original class proportions when creating train and test datasets.

Oversampling is a method where samples from underrepresented classes are duplicated to achieve balanced class distributions. On the other hand, undersampling removes samples from overrepresented classes to reduce their impact on the overall dataset. Both methods aim to create a more balanced dataset.

Lastly, collecting diverse data can help mitigate data bias by incorporating various sources, demographics, and scenarios. This approach ensures the trained models generalize well across different populations and conditions.

While these techniques are widely used, it is essential to consider the specific characteristics of the dataset and problem domain to choose the most suitable approach for handling data bias.
