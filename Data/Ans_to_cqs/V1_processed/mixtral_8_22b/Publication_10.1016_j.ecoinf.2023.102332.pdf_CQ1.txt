In the given context, the authors utilize crowdsourced text data from Wikiloc posts written by hikers about their outdoor experiences. They extract the most frequent single words (unigrams) from these posts to understand the perceptions mentioned by hikers. To collect this raw data, the authors follow a three-step process:

1. Text translation: Since the text descriptions were available in multiple languages (French, English, Dutch, Italian, and Spanish), they first translate all text descriptions into English using DeepL (<https://www.deepl.com>).

2. Data pre-processing: Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, they perform automated text mining in R, employing packages like tidytext and tm. This step involves tokenization, lemmatization, and removing English stop words based on a predefined list of common English words. Additionally, they remove specific sets of words such as the names of countries or towns.

3. Word frequency counting: After pre-processing the data, they count the frequency of each unique word (unigram) to identify the most frequently occurring ones.

Thus, in summary, the authors use crowdsourced text data from Wikiloc posts and apply various NLP techniques to gather raw data for their deep learning pipeline.
