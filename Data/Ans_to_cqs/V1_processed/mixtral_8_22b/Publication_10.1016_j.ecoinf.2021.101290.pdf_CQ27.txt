Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the provided context to determine the exact process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. Typically, after training a deep learning model, the next steps involve saving or serializing the model using a specific format like.h5,.pkl, or.pb, depending on the framework used. Then, the serialized model is deployed onto a suitable platform, which could include cloud services like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Microsoft Azure, or local servers. However, without more specific details about the deep learning model mentioned in the context, I cannot provide a precise answer regarding its deployment process.
