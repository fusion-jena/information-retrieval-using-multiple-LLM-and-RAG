Based on the given context, it appears that the study does not explicitly mention using any specific type of deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. Instead, the study focuses on applying Random Forests (RF) analyses, which is a type of ensemble learning method rather than a deep learning technique. Therefore, based on the information provided, it cannot be determined what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline.
