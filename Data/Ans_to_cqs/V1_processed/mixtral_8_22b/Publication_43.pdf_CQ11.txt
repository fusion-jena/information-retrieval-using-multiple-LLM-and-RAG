Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide a direct link to the data repository for the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context. However, it might be helpful to look for related publications or authors who have worked on this topic, as they may have shared their code and data repositories in platforms like GitHub, Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.

In this specific context, the paper mentions using a training dataset consisting of 100 80x80 pixel image patches containing Ziziphus lotus shrubs and 100 images for bare soil with sparse vegetation. These images were derived from 82 Ziziphus individuals georeferenced by botanical experts in the training zone. While the article does not explicitly state where these datasets can be found, one could potentially reach out to the authors or search for other relevant papers published by them to find more details about the data sources.
