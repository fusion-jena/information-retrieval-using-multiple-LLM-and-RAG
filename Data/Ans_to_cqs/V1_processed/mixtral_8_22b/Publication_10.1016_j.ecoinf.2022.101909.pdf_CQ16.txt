Training completion is determined using the early stopping method with a patience equal to 5. This means that if the validation loss does not improve after five consecutive epochs, the training process stops to prevent overfitting. In this case, optimal training was achieved at the end of the ninth epoch, reaching a maximum loss of 3 for the training and validation subsets respectively.
