The text does not provide explicit details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) as a method for recording the ocean soundscape over large temporal and spatial scales. This suggests that sensors or devices capable of passive acoustic monitoring might be employed for gathering raw data. Additionally, the mention of a'sensor recovery' implies that physical devices are deployed and later retrieved to collect the recorded data. Unfortunately, there is no further information regarding specific types of sensors, surveys, or public datasets used in the process.
