The context does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, common practices include splitting the dataset randomly or using stratified sampling to maintain class balance. Typically, datasets are divided into three parts: training set (around 60-80%), validation set (around 10-20%), and testing set (around 10-20%) depending on the size of the dataset and specific requirements of the project.
