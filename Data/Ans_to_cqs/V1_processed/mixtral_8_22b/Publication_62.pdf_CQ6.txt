The paper does not provide explicit information on the specific preprocessing steps taken before training their deep learning models. However, it is common practice in machine learning to perform various preprocessing techniques such as data normalization, scaling, and cleaning before feeding the data into a model. Data normalization involves transforming the features so they have zero mean and unit variance, which helps prevent any one feature from dominating the others due to its scale. Scaling refers to rescaling numerical values to fit within a certain range, often between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. Cleaning data may involve removing outliers, handling missing values, or correcting inconsistencies in the dataset. These preprocessing steps help improve the performance and efficiency of the deep learning model during training.
