The text does not provide explicit information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions using k-fold cross-validation and evaluating the models based on their performance on both short sequences and longer 1-hour videos. This suggests that the authors might have monitored the model performance by observing its ability to generalize across different data subsets and time scales.
