The text provides information about a study that aims to reduce bias in ecoacoustic indices (EAIs) caused by differences between recording devices. However, it does not explicitly mention any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Instead, the study proposes a preprocessing methodology consisting of three steps to tackle the mentioned issues related to device bias. Unfortunately, the details of this methodology are not included in the given context. Therefore, based on the provided information, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
