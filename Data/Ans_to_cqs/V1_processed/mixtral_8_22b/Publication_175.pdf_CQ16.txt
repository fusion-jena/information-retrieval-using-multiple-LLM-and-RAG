The given context does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete for either data augmentation or few-shot learning methods. However, based on general machine learning practices, some common criteria include reaching a predefined number of epochs, achieving a desired level of performance on a validation set, observing a plateau in the validation loss, or meeting other user-specified conditions. In the case of few-shot learning, where only a small amount of labeled data is available, monitoring the performance on a separate validation set might be more challenging due to the limited data. Instead, one could rely on early stopping techniques or use cross-validation strategies to ensure robustness and prevent overfitting. Nonetheless, without specific details regarding the implementation of these methods in the given context, we cannot definitively state which criteria were employed.
