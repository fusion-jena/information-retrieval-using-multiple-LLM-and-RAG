The provided context does not contain information about the postprocessing steps involved after a model training process. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based on the given context. However, some common postprocessing steps include calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or area under the curve (AUC), creating confusion matrices to visualize the performance of the classifier, generating saliency maps to understand which features contribute most to the predictions, and performing cross-validation to ensure the robustness of the model.
