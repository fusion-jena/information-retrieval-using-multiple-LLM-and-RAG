Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, it does state that the model used default hyperparameters, specifically: number of trees (ntree) set to 500, minimum number of observations in a terminal node (nodesize) set to 5, and number of variables tried at each split (mtry) set to 1. This suggests that the authors did not perform any specific optimization technique like grid search or random search to find the best hyperparameters for their model. Instead, they opted to use commonly accepted default values for these hyperparameters.
