Based on the provided information, it does not appear that any form of deep learning model was utilized in the research or methodology discussed. Instead, the focus seems to be on computing tools and mathematical models related to physiological processes in Drosophila suzukii. Specifically, the researchers employed the DAFNE HPC scientific computing center of the Universit√† degli Studi della Tuscia, which provides two Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) ProLiant DL560 Gen10 nodes, each equipped with multiple processors and significant amounts of RAM. These resources were used to carry out calculations and simulations, but no mention is made of any specific deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), or transformers. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the use of a particular deep learning model in the pipeline.
