The query asks about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, but based on the provided context, there is no information regarding specific datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the context discusses ecological informatics and the use of presence-only (PO) data from various platforms such as eBird, Pl@ntNet, iNaturalist, and Observation.org, which are available on the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). These datasets contain environmental variables related to land area, forest area, water area, elevation, standard deviation of elevation, Laplacian slope, geological category, annual average radiation, annual amount of sunshine, height of snow, organic carbon, cation exchange capacity, pH of soil, temperature, precipitation, actual evapotranspiration amount (AET), potential evapotranspiration amount (PET), PET-AET distance, etc. Therefore, it appears that the study focuses on analyzing these ecological datasets rather than traditional machine learning datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
