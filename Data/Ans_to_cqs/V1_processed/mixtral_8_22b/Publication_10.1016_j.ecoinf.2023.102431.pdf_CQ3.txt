The given context does not directly mention any specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it discusses the use of Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), a machine learning technique, for classifying animal species and sex based on their footprints. In this case, the authors used manual landmark point markings in the FIT interface, which could be considered a form of data annotation. This process involves identifying key features within images (animal footprints) and labeling them accordingly. While this isn't explicitly one of the mentioned techniques (bounding box annotation, instance segmentation), it still falls under the broader category of data annotation.
