The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in this article is for Land Cover/Land Use (LCLU) classification. This is mentioned in the title of the paper, which states "Enhancing Land Cover/Land Use (LCLU) classification through a comparative analysis of hyperparameters optimization approaches for deep neural network (DNN)." Additionally, the abstract mentions that the study focuses on optimizing hyperparameters for improving the performance of deep neural networks in land-use and land-cover classification tasks. Furthermore, the section titled "2.6. DNN architecture optimization strategy" discusses how the model architecture, including the number of layers and neurons, impacts the predictive qualities of the model for classification use cases. Therefore, based on the given information, we can conclude that the purpose of the deep learning model is for LCLU classification.
