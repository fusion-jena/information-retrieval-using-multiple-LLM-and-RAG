The given context does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and landmark annotation. These techniques help label datasets for various tasks such as object detection, image classification, and semantic segmentation.

Based on the context provided, it is unclear which, if any, of these techniques were used in the study. Therefore, a more detailed description or reference to the methodology would be required to determine the exact data annotation technique employed in this case.
