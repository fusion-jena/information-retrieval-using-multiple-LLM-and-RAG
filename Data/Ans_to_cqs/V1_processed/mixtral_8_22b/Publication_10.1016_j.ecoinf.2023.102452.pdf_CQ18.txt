Based on the given information, it appears that the strategy used to monitor the model performance during training involved splitting the available data into two parts - 70% for training and 30% for testing and evaluation. However, there is no specific mention of how the model performance was monitored during the training phase itself. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the exact strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training.
