The text does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, one common criterion mentioned in machine learning literature is the validation loss plateau. When the validation loss stops decreasing significantly or remains constant after several epochs, it might indicate that the model has learned enough from the data and further training could lead to overfitting. Other possible criteria include reaching a predefined maximum number of epochs, achieving a target accuracy level, or observing no improvement in the validation metric for a certain number of epochs. Without more specific details, it cannot be determined exactly what criteria were used in this case.
