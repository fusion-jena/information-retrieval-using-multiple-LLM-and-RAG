The table provided does not contain information about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model such as learning rate or optimizer. However, it does show the hyperparameters used for other algorithms including Random Forest, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines, Penalized Regression, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting, Artificial Neural Network, and k-Nearest Neighbors. These hyperparameters include ntree, mtry, degree, nprune, alpha, lamda, cost, sigma, epsilon, shrinkage, interaction.depth, n.minobsinnode, n.trees, Hiddenlayer, Neurons\_per\_layer, threshold, and k. Each parameter has its own range and optimal value for different models. Unfortunately, without additional information, I cannot provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model.
