While the provided context does not directly mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, some general approaches can still be discussed. Data bias can occur due to various reasons like class imbalance, non-representative samples, etc. To mitigate these issues, several strategies can be employed:

1. Stratified splitting: When dealing with classification problems, especially those involving imbalanced classes, stratification ensures that each subset (training, validation, testing) maintains the same distribution of target variables as the original dataset. This helps prevent overestimation or underestimation of model performance.

2. Oversampling: This method involves duplicating examples from the minority class to balance the dataset. Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is one popular approach that generates new synthetic instances rather than simply replicating existing ones.

3. Undersampling: Contrary to oversampling, undersampling reduces the majority class size to match the minority class. Random Under Sampling (RUS) is a simple way to achieve this, although more sophisticated algorithms like NearMiss exist.

4. Diverse data collection: Collecting diverse datasets that represent all possible scenarios and variations can help minimize bias introduced by limited or skewed data sources. This may involve gathering information from multiple domains, geographical regions, demographics, etc.

In summary, addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline often involves employing techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and collecting diverse datasets. These methods aim to ensure fair representation across different classes and characteristics within the dataset, ultimately improving model accuracy and reliability.
