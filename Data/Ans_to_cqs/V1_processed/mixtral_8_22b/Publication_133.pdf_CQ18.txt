The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using validation data. These data are set aside while training but their annotations by the models are monitored. The validation data help to limit the duration of training, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting. In this study, they used 30 epochs per training task, based on their validation runs.
