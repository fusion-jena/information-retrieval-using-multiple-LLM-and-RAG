Unfortunately, based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it does mention that the hyperparameters were tuned using an Optuna-based hyperparameter optimization procedure, which could potentially help mitigate some forms of bias by optimizing model performance. Additionally, the use of Convolutional LSTM networks suggests that temporal and spatial patterns in the data may have been considered, which can also help reduce certain types of biases. Nonetheless, without more detailed information regarding the preprocessing steps taken, it cannot be definitively stated what techniques were employed to address data bias.
