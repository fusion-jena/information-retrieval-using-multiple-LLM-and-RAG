The text does not provide explicit information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. However, it mentions that MegaDetector can process approximately 3.8 million images per day using specialized hardware and distributing the workload over many processors, specifically 16 NVIDIA V100 GPUs. While this information refers to the hardware used during the application of the model rather than its training, it suggests that GPU resources were likely involved in both stages due to the computational demands of deep learning models like MegaDetector.
