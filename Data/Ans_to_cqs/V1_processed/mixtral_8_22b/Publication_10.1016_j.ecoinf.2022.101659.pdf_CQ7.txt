The text does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (train, test, validation). However, it can be inferred that the data collected from the Venice Lagoon and the Wadden Sea were analyzed separately due to differences in averaging times caused by varying deployment period lengths. The study mentions using daily curves of gaping for each sensor as input in the analysis, resulting in 1286 daily curves for the Venice Lagoon and 203 daily curves for the Wadden Sea. It is possible that the datasets were divided into training, testing, and validation sets based on these daily curves or other factors related to the specific research objectives. Without further details, it cannot be determined exactly how the data was split for deep learning model training.
