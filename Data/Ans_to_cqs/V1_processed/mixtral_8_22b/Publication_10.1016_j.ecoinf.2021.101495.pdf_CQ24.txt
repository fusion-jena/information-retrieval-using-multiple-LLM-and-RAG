The text does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, there are common practices in machine learning and deep learning pipelines to manage randomness. These include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using techniques like cross-validation to reduce variance due to random data splits, and employing ensemble methods to average out the effects of random initialization. In the given context, the authors mention using manual tuning and data augmentation, which could potentially help mitigate the impact of randomness. Nonetheless, without specific details regarding how they handled randomness, we cannot definitively state their approach.
