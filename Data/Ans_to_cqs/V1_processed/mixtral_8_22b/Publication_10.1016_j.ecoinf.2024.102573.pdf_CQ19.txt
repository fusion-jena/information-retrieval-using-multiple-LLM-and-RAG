The deep learning models in this study were built using the PyTorch framework. This can be inferred from the mention of PyTorch in the list of Python packages used in the project. Other packages mentioned include TorchAudio, TorchVision, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, and tqdm. However, none of these are direct competitors or alternatives to PyTorch when it comes to building deep learning models. Therefore, we can confidently state that PyTorch was the primary framework used for developing the deep learning models in this research.
