To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed. One common approach is to use a fixed random seed value across all experiments to ensure reproducibility. This means setting the same initial state for the pseudorandom number generator used in the model training process. Another strategy is to perform multiple runs with different random seeds and average the results to reduce variability caused by random initialization or stochastic processes like dropout. Ensemble methods, which combine predictions from multiple models trained with different random seeds, can also improve performance and robustness. Finally, deterministic algorithms or architectures can be used instead of those involving random components, although this may limit their expressive power or generalization ability.
