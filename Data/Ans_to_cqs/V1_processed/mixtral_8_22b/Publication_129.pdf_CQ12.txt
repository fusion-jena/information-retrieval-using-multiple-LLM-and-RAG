The pipeline uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as its primary deep learning model. This is evident from several references made throughout the text. For instance, it mentions that the feature extractor network could be a pre-trained CNN architecture like Inception [32], Residual Neural Network (Resnet) [33], or Dense Convolutional Network (Densenet) [34]. These are all types of CNN architectures. Furthermore, the equation (1) mentioned in the text is also associated with CNN models, specifically with the loss function used during training. Therefore, based on the given information, we can confidently conclude that the pipeline employs a CNN as its main deep learning model.
