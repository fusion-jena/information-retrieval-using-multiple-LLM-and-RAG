In handling randomness within the deep learning pipeline, various strategies can be implemented. One common approach involves setting a fixed random seed value before running any code that includes stochastic elements. This ensures reproducibility across different runs of the same experiment. Another strategy is to use techniques like cross-validation or bootstrap sampling to reduce variability caused by random initialization of weights in neural networks. Additionally, ensemble methods, where multiple models are trained independently and their predictions combined, can also help mitigate the effects of randomness. However, none of the given references directly discuss these specific strategies; they focus more on applying machine learning algorithms rather than addressing issues related to randomness in deep learning pipelines.
