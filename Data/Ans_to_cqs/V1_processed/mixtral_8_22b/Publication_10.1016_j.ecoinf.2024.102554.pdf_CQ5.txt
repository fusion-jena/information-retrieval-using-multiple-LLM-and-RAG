The text does not provide explicit information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the crawling tool was developed to gather historical and near real-time data from various Space Remote Sensing (SRS) products. These products include data sourced from both ESA and NASA, containing crucial parameters like reflectance, Aerosol Optical Thickness (Kd940), and Chlorophyll-a concentrations. The focus is primarily on Sentinel-3 related products due to their ability to provide daily data from the same world region around the same time, which is essential for developing a monitoring system. Therefore, while we cannot pinpoint the exact dataset names, we can infer that the datasets consist of remote sensing data from satellites like MODIS and OLCI, focusing on parameters relevant to oceanography and atmospheric studies.
