The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is for classification. Specifically, it aims to automatically identify Chagas disease vectors using data mining and deep learning techniques. This involves distinguishing between different triatomine bug species, including Rhodnius, Triatoma, and Panstrongylus, based on images captured with ordinary cellphone cameras. The goal is to improve entomological surveillance systems in Latin America by providing fast, reliable taxonomic support through 'extended' or 'hybrid', participatory surveillance systems with broad geographical-ecological scope.
