To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the dataset was diverse, containing both categorical binary variables and continuous variables. This diversity helped the model learn patterns across various data types. Secondly, cross-validation was employed during the model development phase. Cross-validation is a technique used to assess how well a statistical model will generalize to an independent dataset. It involves partitioning the original sample into subsets such that the analysis is initially performed on a single subset, while all other subsets are retained for subsequent use in validating the initial analysis. Lastly, the dataset was split using stratified sampling. Stratified sampling ensures that the distribution of the target variable remains consistent between the training and testing datasets. This helps prevent any bias towards certain classes in the final model. These measures collectively contributed to enhancing the robustness and reliability of the deep learning model.
