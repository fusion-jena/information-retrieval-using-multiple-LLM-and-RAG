To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, a diverse dataset was used, consisting of multiyear multilocation data. This allowed the model to learn from a wide range of scenarios and conditions, improving its ability to generalize to new situations. Secondly, the model was tested and validated for various activation functions as well as different testing and training data sets. This helped to ensure that the model could perform well across a variety of settings and configurations. Additionally, the use of machine learning techniques such as bootstrap forest and boosted tree models likely contributed to the robustness and adaptability of the final model. However, it is not explicitly stated whether specific techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting were employed during the development process. Nonetheless, these standard practices are often used to further enhance the generalizability of predictive models.
