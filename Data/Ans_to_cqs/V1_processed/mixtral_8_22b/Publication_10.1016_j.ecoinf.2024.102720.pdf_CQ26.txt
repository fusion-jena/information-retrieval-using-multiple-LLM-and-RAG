The given context does not provide specific information about addressing data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, some commonly used techniques to handle data bias include stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified sampling is a method where the dataset is divided into different subsets or strata, ensuring each subset represents the overall population proportionally. This technique helps maintain the balance between classes when dealing with imbalanced datasets.

Oversampling involves duplicating examples from the minority class or creating synthetic samples using interpolation techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). Oversampling can help increase the representation of underrepresented classes in the dataset.

Undersampling is the process of removing instances from the majority class to reduce its size and bring it closer to the minority class. Random undersampling and informed undersampling are two common approaches to this technique.

Collecting diverse data is another way to mitigate data bias by gathering more representative samples from various sources. This approach aims to capture a broader range of features and patterns present in real-world scenarios, ultimately improving model performance and generalization.
