Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention what specific data format is being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer from the context that the data being processed is likely related to sensor data or time series data due to the references made to Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and temporal correlations. Additionally, there is also a reference to Natural Language Processing (NLP) problems, suggesting that text data might also be involved. Therefore, while the exact data format is not specified, it appears that the deep learning pipeline could involve various types of structured data such as numerical values from sensors, timestamps, and potentially unstructured data like text.
