The text does not explicitly mention any specific dataset such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it is mentioned that the model uses spectrogram data to classify 984 bird species. This suggests that the authors have created their own custom dataset containing spectrogram images of bird sounds. Additionally, they use a 3-second window length for implementing data augmentation methods, which further indicates that they are working with temporal sound data rather than traditional image datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
