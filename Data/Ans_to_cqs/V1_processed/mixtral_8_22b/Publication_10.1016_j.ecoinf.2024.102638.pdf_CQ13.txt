Based on the given information, it appears that several machine learning models were utilized, including XGB, RF, SVR, GP, EN, KNN, MLP, Tree, and LR. However, only one of these models, MLP, is typically associated with deep learning. The table mentioned in the text likely contains the specific hyperparameters used for each model, but since it isn't included here, I cannot provide exact hyperparameters for the MLP or any other model.

That being said, some general hyperparameters often used in deep learning include learning rate, optimizer, batch size, number of epochs, and activation function. In the list of potential hyperparameters provided, 'learning\_rate','max\_iter', and 'activation' could potentially apply to the MLP model. However, without more specific information, it's impossible to definitively state which hyperparameters were used for the MLP model.
