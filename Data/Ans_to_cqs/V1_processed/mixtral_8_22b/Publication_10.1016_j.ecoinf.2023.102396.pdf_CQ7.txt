The context does not provide information on the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (i.e., train, test, validation). However, common practices include splitting the dataset into three parts: training set, validation set, and testing set. The training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters during the training process. Finally, the testing set is used to evaluate the performance of the trained model. The proportion of each split can vary depending on the size of the dataset and the problem being addressed. Common splits include 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing or 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing.
