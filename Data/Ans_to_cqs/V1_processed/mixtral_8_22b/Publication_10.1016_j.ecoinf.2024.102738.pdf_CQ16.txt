The context does not provide specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention that at least 196 test points should be considered for defining training and testing samples. This could imply that the completion of training might depend on reaching a certain level of performance on these test points. In general, common criteria for determining when training is complete include observing a plateau in validation loss, achieving a desired level of accuracy, or completing a set number of epochs. Without more specific details, it cannot be definitively stated which criteria are being used in this case.
