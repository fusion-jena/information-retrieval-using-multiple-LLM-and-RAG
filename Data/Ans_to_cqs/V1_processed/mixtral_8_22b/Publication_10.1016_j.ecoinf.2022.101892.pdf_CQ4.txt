The study uses several data augmentation techniques to enhance its deep learning pipeline. These include horizontal flipping, color jitter, rotation, and erasing. Horizontal flipping involves creating new samples by flipping the existing ones horizontally. This technique helps improve the model's ability to generalize better by providing more varied input. Color jitter modifies the brightness, contrast, saturation, or hue of an image to create new variations. Rotation involves rotating the image by a certain degree to generate new samples. Erasing is another technique where parts of the image are removed or obscured to force the model to focus on other features. All these techniques help prevent overfitting and improve the robustness of the model.
