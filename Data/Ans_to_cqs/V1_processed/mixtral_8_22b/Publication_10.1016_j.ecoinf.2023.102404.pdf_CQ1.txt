The papers mentioned in the given context utilize various methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. These include:

1. Airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR): Used to derive Above Ground Biomass (AGB) maps (Hudak et al., 2020; Tamiminia et al., 2021a).

2. Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) Imagery: Utilized to estimate shrub willow biomass (Tamiminia et al., 2021).

3. Satellite Imaging: Including Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data used for crop growth monitoring (Mandal et al., 2020).

4. Public Datasets: Such as those available through Google Earth Engine for geo-big data applications (Adeli et al., 2020).

5. Combination of Airborne LiDAR and Landsat Data: For forest above-ground biomass estimation (Tamiminia et al., 2021a).

6. Integration of Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS)/ICESat and Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI)/ICESat-2 Data: For mapping canopy height of Chinaâ€™s forests (Tamiminia et al., 2022).
