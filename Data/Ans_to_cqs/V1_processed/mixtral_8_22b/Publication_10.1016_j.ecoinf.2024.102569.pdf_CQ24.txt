Based on the given context, it does not directly address the handling of randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some general strategies can be applied to manage randomness in machine learning pipelines, including deep learning.

One strategy is setting a fixed random seed value before training the model. This ensures reproducibility of results across different runs of the same experiment. Another approach is using techniques like cross-validation, where multiple train-test splits are used to evaluate the performance of the model, reducing the effect of any single random split.

Additionally, ensemble methods can also help manage randomness. By combining predictions from multiple models trained with different initializations or architectures, the overall performance becomes more robust against variations due to randomness.

Lastly, Bayesian approaches provide another way to deal with uncertainty and randomness in deep learning models. Instead of producing point estimates, these methods generate probability distributions over possible outcomes, allowing for a more nuanced representation of uncertainty.
