The text does not explicitly mention the use of a deep learning model but discusses the general approach to ensuring the generalizability of a model when data availability is limited. One commonly used technique mentioned is k-fold cross-validation, which involves dividing the full dataset into 'k' approximately equal-sized disjoint subsets or folds. The model is then trained on 'k-1' folds, while the remaining fold is used for assessing prediction accuracy. This process is repeated 'k' times, with each fold serving as the test set once. The overall cross-validation accuracy is estimated by aggregating the squared residuals over the 'k' folds. In conventional k-fold cross-validation, the folds are chosen randomly. However, it should be noted that the text also mentions that confidence intervals from k-fold cross-validation remain a largely unsolved problem requiring further research.
