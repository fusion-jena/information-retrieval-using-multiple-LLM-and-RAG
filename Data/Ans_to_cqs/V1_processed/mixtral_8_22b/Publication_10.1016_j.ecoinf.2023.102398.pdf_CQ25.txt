The text does not explicitly state the specific purpose or task of the deep learning model, such as image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, etc. However, we can infer that the model is likely designed for object detection due to its use of the YOLOv5 architecture, which is primarily known for real-time object detection tasks. Additionally, the mention of anchor boxes and Intersection Over Union (IoU) thresholds further supports this assumption since they are commonly associated with object detection models.

Therefore, we can conclude that the primary purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is most likely object detection.
