The paper does not provide information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it mentions that their approach is open source, so it might be available on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. To find out exactly where the code repository is located, I recommend checking the references mentioned in the paper or contacting the authors directly.
