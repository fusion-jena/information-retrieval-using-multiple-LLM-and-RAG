The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is for classification tasks. Specifically, the model is designed to classify images into their respective family labels or taxa. The model uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and is trained using taxon labels from source images and data. The training process involves selecting a certain number of images from the dataset and using them to train the model, while another set of images is used for testing purposes. The goal is to improve the prediction accuracy of the model in identifying the correct class or family label for the input images. Additionally, the model is also used for between-dataset classification, where it is trained with one dataset and used to predict images from a different dataset.
