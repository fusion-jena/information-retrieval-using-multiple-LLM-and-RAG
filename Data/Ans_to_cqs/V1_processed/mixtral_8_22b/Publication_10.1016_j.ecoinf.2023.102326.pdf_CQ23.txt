The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some indications that suggest possible strategies employed by researchers.

Firstly, the mention of large audio datasets implies that diverse data was collected to train the model. The use of such extensive datasets increases the likelihood of capturing various patterns and characteristics present in the urban acoustic environment (AE), thereby improving the model's ability to generalize well across different scenarios.

Secondly, while not explicitly stated, the adoption of machine learning approaches for sound event classification suggests that techniques like cross-validation might have been utilized during training. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into multiple subsets, where each subset serves as a validation set once while the remaining subsets form the training set. This process helps assess the model's performance on unseen data and reduces overfitting, ultimately contributing to better generalization.

Lastly, the reference to psychoacoustics and smaller field studies indicates that stratified sampling may have been applied when collecting data. Stratified sampling ensures that the sample represents all relevant aspects of the population, thus enhancing the model's capacity to capture diverse features of the urban AE.

In conclusion, based on the given context, it appears that the researchers likely employed diverse datasets, cross-validation, and possibly stratified sampling to improve the deep learning model's generalizability. However, without further details, these assumptions remain speculative.
