The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps after the model training. However, it can be inferred that some form of evaluation is performed on the trained models using an external evaluation dataset. This evaluation involves calculating metrics such as Area Under Curve (AUC) and True Skill Statistic (TSS). These metrics help assess the performance of the trained models. Additionally, the context mentions that the models were evaluated using a separate fold set aside for external evaluation, indicating that some form of comparison or validation might have been conducted between the predicted values and actual values. It should also be noted that the context discusses maintaining consistency across background points used to train each model to avoid variations in model results due to differences in the response variable. This suggests that some form of standardization or normalization might have been applied before or after the model training. However, without further information, it cannot be confirmed if other postprocessing steps like saliency maps or confusion matrices were employed.
