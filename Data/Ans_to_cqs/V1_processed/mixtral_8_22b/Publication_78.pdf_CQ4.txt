The paper does not provide information on any specific data augmentation techniques applied in their deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it cannot be determined what data augmentation techniques were used based solely on the given context.

Based on the context provided, the authors use various methods such as hyper-spectral bottom index imagery and deep convolutional neural networks like VGG-19 for bottom-type classification in coral reef areas. However, there is no mention of any data augmentation techniques being applied in the deep learning pipeline. It can only be assumed that some form of preprocessing was done before feeding the images into the model, but the exact details are not mentioned.
