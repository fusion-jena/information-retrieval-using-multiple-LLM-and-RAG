In this case, the performance of the deep learning models, specifically XGBoost and LightGBM, is evaluated using three main metrics: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R2. These metrics help assess the predictive accuracy of the models. RMSE measures the average magnitude of errors made by the model, while MAE calculates the average absolute difference between predictions and actual values. Lastly, R2 represents the proportion of variance explained by the model, indicating how well future samples are likely to fit the model.
