Based on the given information, it appears that the hyperparameters of the model were optimized using specific values rather than methods such as grid search or random search. These values can be found in Table 2, where various parameter names are listed along with their corresponding values. Some examples include lr0 set to 0.01, Lrf set to 0.01, momentum set to 0.937, weight\_decay set to 0.0005, warmup\_epochs set to 3.0, and so on. However, there is no explicit mention of how these values were determined or if any optimization techniques like grid search or random search were employed. Therefore, we cannot definitively state whether these hyperparameters were optimized using those methods.
