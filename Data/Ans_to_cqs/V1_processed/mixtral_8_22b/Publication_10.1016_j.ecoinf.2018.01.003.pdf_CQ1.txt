The given context does not provide explicit details about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the researchers might have used various sources such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets to gather their input data. For instance, they could have collected data through environmental monitoring systems equipped with sensors, or accessed publicly available databases containing relevant ecological indicators. Additionally, they may have conducted surveys to collect socioeconomic data related to urban development and resource consumption patterns. Nevertheless, without further clarification from the authors, we cannot definitively state the exact methods employed for gathering raw data in this particular research project.
