Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be taken to ensure optimal performance. These may include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing any irrelevant or redundant information from the dataset. It could also involve handling missing values, either by filling them in using statistical methods like mean imputation or median imputation, or by simply dropping those rows or columns.

2. Normalization or Standardization: This step is crucial for many machine learning algorithms, including deep learning models. Normalization scales the features to a range between 0 and 1, while standardization transforms the features so they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Both techniques help to bring all features to the same scale, preventing any one feature from dominating the others due to its larger magnitude.

3. Feature Scaling: Similar to normalization and standardization, feature scaling rescales the values of features into a certain range. However, unlike normalization and standardization, it does not necessarily aim to maintain the distribution of the original data.

4. Encoding Categorical Variables: Deep learning models cannot handle categorical variables directly. Therefore, these variables need to be converted into numerical form. One common way to do this is through label encoding or one-hot encoding.

5. Splitting Dataset: Before training the model, the dataset is usually split into two parts - training set and test set. The training set is used to train the model, while the test set is used to evaluate its performance. Sometimes, a third part called validation set is also created to tune hyperparameters during the training process.
