Unfortunately, there isn't any information available in the provided context regarding handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or setting specific random seed values. However, I can provide some general insights about managing randomness in deep learning pipelines.

Randomness plays a significant role in various stages of deep learning, including weight initialization, data shuffling, dropout regularization, etc. To ensure reproducibility and consistency across experiments, researchers often use fixed random seeds. By setting a specific seed value, we can reproduce the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers, making our results consistent and comparable.

In Python, for example, we can use the numpy library to set a global random seed like so: `numpy.random.seed(seed_value)`. Similarly, other libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch have their own methods to set random seeds. In TensorFlow, you can use `tf.random.set_seed(seed_value)`, while in PyTorch, you can use `torch.manual_seed(seed_value)` and `torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True` to enable determinism in cuDNN operations.
