The text does not provide explicit information about the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that different data augmentation techniques could increase the power of generalization, suggesting that some form of data augmentation was likely employed. Data augmentation techniques commonly used in deep learning include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, and adding noise to images. These techniques help improve model robustness and prevent overfitting by increasing the diversity of the training dataset. Without further context, it cannot be determined exactly which data augmentation techniques were utilized in this study.
