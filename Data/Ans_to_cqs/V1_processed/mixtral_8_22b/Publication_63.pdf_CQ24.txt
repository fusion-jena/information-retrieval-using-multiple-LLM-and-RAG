To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed. One common strategy is to use a fixed random seed value throughout the entire process. By setting a specific seed value, the random processes within the deep learning pipeline become deterministic, ensuring reproducibility of results. Another strategy is to perform multiple runs or experiments with different random seeds and then average the results. This helps reduce the impact of any single run being influenced by a particularly good or bad initialization. Additionally, techniques like ensemble methods can also help mitigate the effects of randomness by combining the outputs of multiple models trained with different initializations. However, it should be noted that while these strategies can help manage randomness, they cannot completely eliminate its influence on the overall process.
