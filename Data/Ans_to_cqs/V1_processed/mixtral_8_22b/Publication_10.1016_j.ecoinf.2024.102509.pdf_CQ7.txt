The context does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into sets such as train, test, or validation. However, it mentions that repeated training and testing are necessary to develop an optimal neural network and achieve high accuracy. This implies that splitting the data into separate subsets for training and testing purposes is essential. Common practices include using a random sampling method to divide the available data into a training set (typically around 70-80%) and a test set (remaining 20-30%), which allows evaluating the performance of the trained model on unseen data. Additionally, some researchers may also use a third subset called the validation set during the training process to fine-tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.
