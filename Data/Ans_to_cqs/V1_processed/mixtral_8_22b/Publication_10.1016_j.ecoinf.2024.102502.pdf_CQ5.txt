Based on the provided context, there is no information about the use of any specific dataset for deep learning pipelines like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, the text does mention using the Earth Observation System (EOS) data catalogue from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) online repository. This suggests that the authors might have been working with remote sensing data rather than traditional computer vision datasets. Therefore, without further context, I cannot provide a definitive list of datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
