Unfortunately, there isn't any information about specific data augmentation techniques used in the given context. However, some common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, translation, and color space transformations. These techniques help improve model performance and prevent overfitting by increasing the diversity of training data without collecting new images or videos.
