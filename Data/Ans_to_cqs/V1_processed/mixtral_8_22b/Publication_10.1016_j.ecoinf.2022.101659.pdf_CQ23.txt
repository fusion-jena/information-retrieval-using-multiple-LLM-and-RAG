The text does not provide explicit information about any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, it mentions the use of big-data on valve gaping from a few sentinel organisms along with temperature and chlorophyll, which could potentially contribute to creating a diverse dataset. Additionally, the study includes data from two distinct locations - the Venice Lagoon and the Wadden Sea - further increasing the diversity of the dataset. While there is no mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting techniques being employed, the inclusion of data from multiple areas and species suggests an attempt to create a robust and generalizable model.
