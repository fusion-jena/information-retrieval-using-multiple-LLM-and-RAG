After the model training, there are several post-processing steps that can be taken to evaluate the performance of the model and gain insights into its predictions. Some common post-processing techniques include saliency maps, metrics calculation, and confusion matrices.

Saliency maps are a visualization technique used to highlight the regions of an input image that have the most significant impact on the output prediction. This can help identify which features of the input images are most important for making accurate predictions.

Metrics calculation involves computing various measures of accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., to assess the overall performance of the model. These metrics provide insight into how well the model performs across different classes or categories.

A confusion matrix is another useful tool for evaluating the performance of a classification model. It provides a summary of the predicted versus actual class labels, allowing us to see where the model made mistakes and what types of errors it tends to make.

In this research, the authors do not explicitly mention any specific post-processing steps they took after model training. However, based on the information provided, we can infer that they likely performed some form of metrics calculation to determine the accuracy of their models. They also evaluated the correctness of their models by calculating the correct rate through model evaluation. Additionally, they may have used other post-processing techniques such as saliency maps or confusion matrices to further analyze their results.
