After the model training, there are several postprocessing steps involved. According to the given context, the postprocessing steps include morphological opening and closing operations. These operations are performed on the Relevance Class Map (RCM) generated from the model. Morphological opening involves performing an erosion followed by dilation using a structural element. This operation helps remove very small misclassified pixels or speckles. On the other hand, morphological closing involves performing a dilation followed by erosion using a structural element. This operation helps close the gaps and holes in the classified map. Both these operations help increase spatial coherency. Additionally, it is worth noting that these operations are performed iteratively until the desired results are achieved. However, the context does not mention any specifics regarding saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, based on the given context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training are morphological opening and closing operations.
