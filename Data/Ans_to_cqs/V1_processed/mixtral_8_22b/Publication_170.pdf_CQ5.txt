Based on the given context, the dataset used in the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model is not explicitly mentioned. However, there is mention of a BMXSM dataset consisting of 36,490 images. It appears this dataset was used for training and testing the DCNN model. Unfortunately, without further information about the BMXSM dataset, I cannot provide specific details regarding its content or how it compares to other well-known datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
