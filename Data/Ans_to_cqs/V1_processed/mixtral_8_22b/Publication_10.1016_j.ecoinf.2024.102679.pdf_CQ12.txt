The text does not provide specific details about the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It only mentions that a 'DL model' was used, which could refer to any number of models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or Transformers. Therefore, without additional context, it is impossible to determine the exact type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
