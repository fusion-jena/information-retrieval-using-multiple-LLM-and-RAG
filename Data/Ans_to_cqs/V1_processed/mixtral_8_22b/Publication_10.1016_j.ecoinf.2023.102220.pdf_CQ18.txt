The text does not explicitly mention the specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, it can be inferred that the authors used various metrics such as accuracy, false positive rate, and true positive rate to evaluate the performance of their proposed Predictive Boundary Points (PBP) method. They also compared the performance of their method with other machine learning techniques like Support Vector Machines, Deep Neural Networks, Long Short Term Memory, and Random Forests. Additionally, they mentioned using different percentages of the initial observations of the time series of aphids for training, indicating that they might have employed cross-validation or similar strategies to assess the model's performance on unseen data.
