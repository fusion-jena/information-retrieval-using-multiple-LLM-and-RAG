According to the given information, there are several data repositories mentioned such as Figshare, Zenodo, Dryad, CSIRO, Ag Data Commons, KNB Data Repository, ZALF Open Research Data, and Agricultural and Environmental Data Archive (AEDA). However, it does not provide specific details about a deep learning pipeline being available in any of these repositories. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
