The provided context does not explicitly state the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as reaching a validation loss plateau or achieving a certain accuracy threshold. However, it does mention that the recommended approach for training data includes a high level of confidence for inclusion, particularly for species with small study areas. It also suggests that reasonable classification results can be obtained for all species using BANTER classification methods with as few as two samples per class. Therefore, while the exact criteria for determining when training is complete are not specified, it appears that the focus is on ensuring a high level of confidence in the training data and obtaining satisfactory classification results even with limited samples.
