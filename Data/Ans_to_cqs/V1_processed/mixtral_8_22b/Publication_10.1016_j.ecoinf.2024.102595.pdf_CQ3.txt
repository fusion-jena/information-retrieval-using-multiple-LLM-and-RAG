The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it discusses the application of deep learning algorithms like Deep Neural Networks for predictive modeling in agriculture, specifically for oil palm yield predictions. In general, data annotation techniques depend on the type of problem being solved and the nature of the input data. For image-based tasks, common annotation methods include bounding boxes, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. But since the context focuses on predictive analysis rather than object detection or classification, it doesn't delve into those particular annotation techniques.
