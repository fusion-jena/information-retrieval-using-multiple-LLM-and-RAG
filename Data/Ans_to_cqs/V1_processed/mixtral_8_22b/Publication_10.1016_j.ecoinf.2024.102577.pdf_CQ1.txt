The article does not provide explicit information on the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the machine learning pipeline. However, it mentions using combined catches and environmental datasets. These could potentially include data from various sources such as satellite imagery, oceanographic buoys, or other marine monitoring systems for environmental variables like sea surface temperature, chlorophyll concentrations, etc. Historical catch and bycatch data might have been collected through logbooks, observer programs, or other fisheries management databases.
