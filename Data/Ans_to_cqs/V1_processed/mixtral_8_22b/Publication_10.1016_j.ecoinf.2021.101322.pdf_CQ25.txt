The purpose of the deep learning model in this case is not explicitly stated as either classification, segmentation, or detection. However, given that the model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is commonly used for image analysis tasks, and considering that the performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as test loss, mean squared error (MSE), mean average percentage error (MAPE), and accuracy, it can be inferred that the model is likely being used for some form of image-based regression task. Furthermore, the fact that the accuracy of the regression tasks is calculated by rounding the prediction to the nearest integer age suggests that the model might be used for predicting the age of salmon scales based on their images.
