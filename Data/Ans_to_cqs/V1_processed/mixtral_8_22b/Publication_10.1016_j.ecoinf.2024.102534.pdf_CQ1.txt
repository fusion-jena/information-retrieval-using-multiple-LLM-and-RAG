The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, based on the roles and responsibilities mentioned for each individual, we can infer some possible methods used for data collection.

The individuals listed with tasks such as "Data curation," "Investigation," and "Validation" may be involved in gathering or processing raw data from various sources. These sources could include surveys, sensors, public datasets, or other means of data collection relevant to their research or project. For example, those involved in "Project administration" might coordinate efforts to collect data using these methods.

Additionally, some individuals have been assigned tasks related to visualization, software, methodology, formal analysis, conceptualization, and resources. This suggests that they may use specialized tools, techniques, or approaches to process and analyze the collected data within the deep learning pipeline.

However, without more specific details regarding the nature of the research or projects being conducted by these individuals, it is difficult to definitively state which methods are being employed for collecting raw data in this particular case.
