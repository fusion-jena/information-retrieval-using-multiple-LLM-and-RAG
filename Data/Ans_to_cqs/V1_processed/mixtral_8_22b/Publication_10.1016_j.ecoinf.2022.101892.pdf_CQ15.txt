The text does not provide explicit information about the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, or others. However, it mentions that the model was trained using PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework that supports various optimization algorithms. Additionally, the text discusses the application of pre-training on the ImageNet dataset and fine-tuning on custom datasets, which can be considered optimization strategies to improve model performance and reduce training time. Furthermore, the authors mention applying aggressive data augmentation to prevent overfitting and addressing imbalanced problems, which can also be seen as optimization techniques within the deep learning pipeline.
