After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the project. Some common postprocessing steps include:

1. Model evaluation metrics: Calculating various evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination (R^2) is essential to assess the performance of the trained models. In this study, the authors have chosen the set of hyperparameter values that result in minimum MAE and RMSE along with the highest R^2 value for each machine learning model.

2. Hyperparameter optimization: To improve the performance of the trained models further, hyperparameter optimization techniques such as Randomized Grid Search can be employed. The authors have utilized this method to randomly select a subset of the parameter grid to explore instead of exhaustively searching through all possible combinations of hyperparameters.

3. Visualization tools: Using visualization tools such as saliency maps can help understand how different input variables contribute towards the final prediction made by the model. However, there is no mention of any visualization tool being used in this study.

4. Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix is often used to evaluate the performance of classification models. Since this study focuses on regression tasks, a confusion matrix might not be applicable here.

5. Cross-validation: Performing cross-validation can provide insights into the generalizability of the trained models. Although not explicitly mentioned in the given context, cross-validation could potentially be one of the postprocessing steps carried out in this study.
