Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide a direct link to the data repository for the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context. The text does mention that commercial restrictions apply to the availability of data used in this work, which suggests that the data might not be publicly accessible or shared due to certain limitations or agreements.

However, the context does provide references to various resources such as PyTorch, scikit-learn, and skorch documentation, along with their respective years of publication. You may find more details about the machine learning pipeline and its implementation using those resources. Additionally, the context mentions that links to public code examples are available, although they aren't explicitly listed here.

To summarize, I cannot directly provide the requested data repository link based on the given context. Nevertheless, you can explore the referenced resources and look for additional information regarding the deep learning pipeline and its implementation.
