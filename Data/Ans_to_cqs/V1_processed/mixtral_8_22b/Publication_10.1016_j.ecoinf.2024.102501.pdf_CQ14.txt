According to the given context, various search algorithms are employed to optimize model parameters, including the genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). These algorithms help determine optimal hyperparameters for different machine learning models like neural networks, SVMs, and others.

For instance, Yan utilized GA and PSO to optimize a backpropagation (BP) neural network for building a dissolved oxygen (DO) estimation model of Beijing Lake in Beijing [1]. Moreover, PSO has been widely used in conjunction with several algorithms, such as BPNN, GRU, LSTM, SVM, support vector regression (SVR), and others, demonstrating high efficiency and robustness with minimal computation [2][3][4][5][6][7].

Additionally, other optimization algorithms, like the multi-verse optimizer, have been implemented for parameter optimization [8]. However, the context does not explicitly mention specific methods such as grid search or random search for hyperparameter tuning. Nonetheless, it implies that search algorithms like GA and PSO play a significant role in optimizing model parameters, contributing to enhanced performance and accuracy in predicting DO concentrations in rivers.
