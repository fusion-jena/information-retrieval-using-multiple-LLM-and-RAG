In this study, the input of the training data was split into two sets: 70% of the samples were used for training and 30% for testing. This division aimed to estimate the ability of the DNN algorithm to map burned areas in the study area. However, it should be noted that this method generates an accuracy that is biased because it uses the same sample sets to test the model. Therefore, an additional accuracy assessment using validation points was also conducted in the analysis.
