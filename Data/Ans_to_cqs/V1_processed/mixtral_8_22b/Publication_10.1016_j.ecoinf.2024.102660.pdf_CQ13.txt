The deep learning model used is called Res_AUNet, which was built using the PyTorch library. The experiments were conducted on a Dell workstation with specific hardware configurations. During the network training process, the input images underwent random rotations, flips, and other image augmentation operations to enhance the network's robustness. Training persisted for 120 epochs, with a batch size set to 8. The initial learning rate was set to 0.001, and the learning rate was adjusted using the equal-interval adjustment strategy (StepLR), halving the original rate every 10 epochs of iteration. However, the information about the optimizer used is not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
