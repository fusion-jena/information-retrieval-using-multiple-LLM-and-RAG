The experiments were conducted using the R framework (version 3.3.2), on a Windows 10 machine with 2 CPUs with 2.60 GHz and 4 cores each, and one GPU NVIDIA Quadro M1000M. The deep learning models were fitted with the package mxnet, which is a convenient C++ library for learning deep neural networks and is deployed as an R package. It integrates a high level symbolic language for quickly building customized models and loss functions, and automatically distributes calculations under CPUs or GPUs. In this case, the use of a GPU (specifically, the NVIDIA Quadro M1000M) suggests that the deep learning models were trained using GPU resources.
