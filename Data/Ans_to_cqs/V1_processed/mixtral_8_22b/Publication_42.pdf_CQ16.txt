Based on the given information, it does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, there are some indications that can be inferred from the text. For instance, the paper mentions that the chosen model was validated, suggesting that the training process might have been stopped once the desired level of performance was reached during validation. Additionally, the use of a confusion matrix for validation implies that the model's performance was evaluated against unseen data, which could also serve as a stopping criterion if the model performs satisfactorily. Furthermore, the discussion about overfitting suggests that monitoring the validation loss or other metrics related to generalization might have played a role in deciding when to stop training. Nevertheless, without explicit details regarding the stopping criteria, one cannot definitively state what criteria were used to determine when training was complete.
