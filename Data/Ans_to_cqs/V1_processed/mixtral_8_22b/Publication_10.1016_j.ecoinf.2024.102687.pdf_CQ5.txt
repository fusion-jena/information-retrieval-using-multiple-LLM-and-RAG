Two main datasets were mentioned in the given context. The first one is the ImageNet database, which was used to train various convolutional neural network (CNN) backbones such as ResNet18, VGG16, DenseNet121, and AlexNet. The ImageNet database consists of 1000 object classes with over 1 million training images, 50,000 validation images, and 100,000 test images. However, it should be noted that the ImageNet database does not contain spectrograms.

The second dataset mentioned is the Darksound dataset, which was used to fine-tune the pretrained DenseNet. The results showed that fine-tuning a pretrained DenseNet on the Darksound dataset returned the highest DBCV scores in almost all cases, indicating the importance of selecting the appropriate dataset for fine-tuning the model.

Additionally, recent studies have suggested that using features extracted from models trained on smaller but more specific datasets can lead to higher quality classification. For instance, using features extracted from a model trained on spectrograms of bird sounds could potentially improve the parameter initialization of unsupervised machine learning (UML) algorithms of the maximum entropy classifier (MEC) method.
