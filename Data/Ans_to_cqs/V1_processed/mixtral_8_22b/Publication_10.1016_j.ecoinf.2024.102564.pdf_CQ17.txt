Regularization methods are techniques used to prevent overfitting in machine learning and deep learning pipelines. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise along with underlying patterns, resulting in poor generalization performance on unseen data. Two common regularization methods mentioned in the given context are Dropout and L2 Regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent complex co-adaptations between neurons. This results in more robust features being learned, reducing overfitting. During testing, no neurons are dropped, but their outputs are scaled down proportionally to the dropout rate used during training.

L2 Regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function based on the sum of squared weights. By adding this penalty, the optimization process encourages smaller weights, leading to simpler models that are less likely to overfit. The strength of the penalty can be controlled by adjusting the regularization parameter lambda.

In summary, both Dropout and L2 Regularization are effective techniques for preventing overfitting in deep learning pipelines. Dropout achieves this by ignoring random neurons during training, while L2 Regularization imposes a penalty on large weights, encouraging simpler models.
