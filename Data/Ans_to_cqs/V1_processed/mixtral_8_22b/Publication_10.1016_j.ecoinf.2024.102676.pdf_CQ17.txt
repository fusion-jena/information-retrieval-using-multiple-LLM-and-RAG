The query asks about regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. Regularization techniques help improve the generalization performance of machine learning algorithms by reducing their complexity and preventing them from memorizing the training data. Two common regularization methods mentioned in the query are dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a technique proposed by Geoffrey Hinton et al. (2012) to address the problem of overfitting in neural networks. Dropout works by randomly dropping out neurons along with their connections during training, which helps reduce co-adaptations between neurons and encourages the network to learn more robust features. During testing, no neurons are dropped, but their outputs are scaled down proportionately to account for the reduced capacity due to dropout.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is another popular regularization method used in deep learning. It adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. By penalizing large weights, L2 regularization discourages complex models and promotes simpler solutions that generalize better to unseen data.

Other regularization methods not explicitly mentioned in the query include L1 regularization, early stopping, and batch normalization. L1 regularization, like L2 regularization, adds a penalty term to the loss function, but instead of squaring the weights, it takes their absolute value. Early stopping involves monitoring the validation error during training and halting the process once the error starts increasing, indicating that the model has begun to overfit. Batch normalization is a technique that normalizes the inputs to each layer in a neural network, helping stabilize the learning process and improving generalization performance.
