In the given context, there isn't explicit information about specific criteria for determining when training is complete. However, we can infer some potential indicators based on the methods employed in the study.

One common criterion for determining when training is complete is the observation of a validation loss plateau. In other words, if the validation loss stops decreasing significantly after several epochs, it might indicate that the model has learned most of what it can from the training data.

In this study, the researchers use k-fold cross-validation to divide their dataset into five subsets. Each subset serves as a validation set once, while the remaining four subsets form the training set. This process is repeated five times, allowing each sample to be trained and validated in a different subset.

While the text does not explicitly mention a validation loss plateau, the fact that they perform multiple rounds of training and validation suggests that they monitor the performance of the model across these iterations. It's reasonable to assume that they would stop training when they observe no significant improvement in the model's performance on the validation sets.

Additionally, the study mentions the use of an appearance feature descriptor and a restriction condition represented by Equation (6), which seems to play a role in determining the quality of matches between detected and predicted boxes. While this doesn't directly relate to stopping criteria for training, it indicates that the researchers consider various metrics to evaluate the model's performance.

Therefore, although the exact criteria for determining when training is complete aren't specified, it's likely that the researchers monitor the model's performance on the validation sets and stop training when they see little or no improvement.
