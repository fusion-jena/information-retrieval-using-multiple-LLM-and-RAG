After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be taken to evaluate and interpret the results. These include:

1. Saliency Maps: These visualize which parts of the input data had the most influence on the model’s output. They help identify important features in the data and can aid in interpreting the model’s decision-making process.

2. Metrics Calculation: Various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score can be calculated to assess the performance of the model. These metrics provide insights into how well the model is able to classify the data.

3. Confusion Matrix: This is a table layout that allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm. It provides information about actual and predicted values generated by a classification system. It gives us insight not only into the errors made by the classifier but more importantly the types of errors that are being made.

In the given context, the paper discusses the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for urban ecoacoustic assessment. After training the models, the authors likely performed similar postprocessing steps to evaluate and interpret the results. However, the specific steps taken are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
