To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. One such technique mentioned in the given context is stratified splitting. This method ensures that the distribution of classes remains consistent across the training, validation, and test datasets. By maintaining this balance, the model can learn more effectively without any skewed representation towards certain classes.

Another technique that could help mitigate data bias is diverse data collection. In the case of invasive alien plant species detection, collecting data from multiple locations and under varying conditions can improve the robustness of the model. A diverse dataset will enable the model to generalize well and perform accurately even when presented with new, unseen data.

Oversampling and undersampling are also useful techniques to handle imbalanced datasets. Oversampling involves duplicating examples from the minority class, while undersampling removes instances from the majority class. These methods aim to create a balanced dataset, which can lead to improved model performance.

Data augmentation is another strategy mentioned in the context to tackle data bias. Data augmentation techniques like horizontal flipping, scaling contrast, and cropping images can increase the diversity of the dataset and prevent overfitting. By applying these transformations, the model becomes exposed to a wider range of variations within the same class, making it more resilient against biases.
