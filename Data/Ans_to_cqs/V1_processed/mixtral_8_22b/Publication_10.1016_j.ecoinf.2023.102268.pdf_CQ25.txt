The purpose of the deep learning model in this case is for classification. Specifically, it uses a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network (ResNet-50) to extract features from spectrogram images of underwater sounds. These features are then used as inputs to a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, which differentiates 'boatwhistle' signals from other signals. This approach is a form of transfer learning, where a pre-trained model is adapted for a new task.
