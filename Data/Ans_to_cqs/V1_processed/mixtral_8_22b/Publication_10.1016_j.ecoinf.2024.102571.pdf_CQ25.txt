The purpose of the deep learning model developed by T. Wang et al. is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the model is used for predictive purposes. Specifically, the authors mention using a three-layer feedforward back-propagation neural network with a 30-20-10 architecture to predict GHGdwts (greenhouse gas emissions). This suggests that the model is designed for regression analysis rather than classification, segmentation, or detection tasks. In summary, the primary objective of this deep learning model appears to be forecasting greenhouse gas emissions based on input factors such as population size and GDP.
