Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or managing random seed values. However, one strategy mentioned indirectly is data augmentation. This technique involves creating new training samples by applying random transformations such as flipping, cropping, contrast shifting, translating, and rotating the existing data. These manipulations introduce variability and help prevent overfitting, which can be caused by randomness in the model initialization or during training. While this doesn't directly address the issue of controlling randomness from factors like random seed values, it does provide a way to mitigate some of its negative impacts. Other common strategies not explicitly mentioned here include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using ensemble methods, or employing techniques like dropout regularization to reduce reliance on specific initializations.
