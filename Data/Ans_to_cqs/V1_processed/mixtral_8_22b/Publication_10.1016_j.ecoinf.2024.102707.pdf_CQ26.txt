The paper does not provide explicit information on specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions using a diverse dataset collected from various sources, such as citizen scientists, researchers, and government agencies. This suggests that they may have employed diverse data collection strategies to mitigate potential biases. Additionally, the authors mention training their models using multiple datasets, which could also help reduce any inherent biases present within individual datasets. Nevertheless, without further details, it is impossible to confirm if other common techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling were utilized.
