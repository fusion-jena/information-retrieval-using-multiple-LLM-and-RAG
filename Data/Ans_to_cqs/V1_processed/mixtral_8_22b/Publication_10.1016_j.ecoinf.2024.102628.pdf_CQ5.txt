In the given context, it appears that the authors utilized the pretrained ResNet-34 architecture, which is a variant of the ResNet family, widely used for deep learning tasks, particularly in computer vision. They leveraged existing knowledge from the ResNet-34 model trained on the ImageNet dataset. To improve their dataset, they incorporated multi-temporal data from March, September, and October 2015 across three environments. However, the specific names of the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline were not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, based on the available information, it can be concluded that the primary dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is ImageNet, along with additional unnamed multi-temporal datasets.
