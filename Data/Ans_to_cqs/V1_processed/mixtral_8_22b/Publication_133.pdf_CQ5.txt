The text does not provide explicit information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the data of images is available online at <http://meshi1.cs.bgu.ac.il/FIE2020_data>. Additionally, the paper references two popular object detection frameworks, Faster R-CNN and YOLO, which have been trained on various datasets like COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset and Pascal VOC dataset. Therefore, it can be inferred that the researchers might have used similar datasets for training their deep learning models. Nevertheless, without further details, we cannot confirm the exact datasets used in their deep learning pipeline.
