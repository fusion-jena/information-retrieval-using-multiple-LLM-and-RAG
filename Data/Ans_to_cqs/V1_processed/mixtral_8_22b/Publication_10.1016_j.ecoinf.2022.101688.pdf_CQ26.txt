To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets or strata based on specific criteria, ensuring that each subset maintains the same distribution of target variables as the original dataset. This technique helps prevent any skewed representations of the target variable in the training and validation sets.

Oversampling is another method used to balance the dataset by increasing the number of instances from the minority class. This can be achieved through various methods like random oversampling, SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Overpopulation Technique), and ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling). Random oversampling duplicates existing instances from the minority class, while SMOTE and ADASYN create new synthetic instances based on the features of the minority class.

Undersampling aims to reduce the number of instances from the majority class to match the count of the minority class. Common undersampling techniques include random undersampling, NearMiss, and Tomek links. Random undersampling removes instances from the majority class randomly, whereas NearMiss selects instances from the majority class that are closest to the minority class. Tomek links remove instances from the majority class that form Tomek link pairs with instances from the minority class.

Diverse data collection focuses on gathering more representative data from underrepresented groups or classes. This can involve collecting additional data points or sourcing data from different locations, environments, or devices. By diversifying the data sources, it becomes possible to mitigate biases introduced due to limited or unbalanced data availability.

In the given context, the authors mention addressing class imbalance issues by randomly augmenting the presence spectrograms using a time-shift operation to generate synthetic spectrograms. This approach aligns with the concept of oversampling, where synthetic instances are created to balance the dataset. However, the text does not explicitly discuss other techniques like stratified splitting, undersampling, or diverse data collection.
