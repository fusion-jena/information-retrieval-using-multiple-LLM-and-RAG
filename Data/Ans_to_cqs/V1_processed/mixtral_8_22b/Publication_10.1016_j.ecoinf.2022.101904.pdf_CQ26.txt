To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets while maintaining the same proportions of class labels across all subsets. This ensures that the distribution of target variables remains consistent throughout the entire dataset.

Oversampling is a technique used to increase the representation of minority classes within the dataset. It does so by duplicating examples from these classes until they reach a desired proportion relative to other classes. Alternatively, new instances can also be generated through interpolation between existing ones.

Undersampling, conversely, reduces the size of majority classes to balance their representation against minority classes. This approach may lead to loss of information but can still improve overall performance if applied judiciously.

Lastly, collecting diverse datasets helps mitigate biases inherent in any single source of data. By incorporating multiple perspectives and sources, the resulting model becomes more robust and generalizable across various scenarios.

In summary, addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline requires careful consideration of available options such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Each method has its strengths and weaknesses; hence, selecting the most appropriate strategy depends largely on specific requirements and constraints of individual projects.
