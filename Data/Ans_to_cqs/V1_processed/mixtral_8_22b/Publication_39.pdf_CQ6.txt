Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, the text does mention data augmentation for action recognition. Data augmentation techniques can include various transformations like rotation, flipping, zooming, cropping, etc., which help improve the generalizability of the model. Additionally, the context mentions splitting the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets, which is another crucial step before training a deep learning model.
