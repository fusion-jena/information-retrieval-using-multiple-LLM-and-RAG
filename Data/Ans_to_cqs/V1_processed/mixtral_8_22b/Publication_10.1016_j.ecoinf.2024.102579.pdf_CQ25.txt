The text does not provide explicit information about the use of any deep learning models. However, based on the context, it appears that the authors are discussing various methods for estimating diversity indices in ecology, specifically in the context of continuous cover forestry. These methods include the inventory estimator, NN1 and NN2 estimators, and NN3 and NN4 estimators. While these may involve some form of machine learning or statistical modeling, there is no mention of deep learning models such as those used for classification, segmentation, or object detection. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer regarding the purpose of a deep learning model in this context.
