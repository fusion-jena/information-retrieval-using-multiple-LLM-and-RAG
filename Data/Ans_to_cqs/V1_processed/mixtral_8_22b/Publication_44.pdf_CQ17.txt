The given context does not provide explicit details about specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, there are some techniques mentioned that could potentially help mitigate overfitting indirectly. For instance, freezing earlier layers of the pre-trained VGG16 network makes those layers non-trainable, effectively reducing the overall capacity of the model and thus its ability to memorize the training set. Additionally, the inclusion of an extra max-pooling layer before the fully connected layers helps reduce dimensionality, further limiting the model's capacity. Lastly, data augmentation techniques like image flipping, rotation, and shifting are employed during training, which can aid in preventing overfitting by introducing variations into the training data.
