Based on the given context, there isn't enough information to provide a definitive answer regarding the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, common criteria used in machine learning include reaching a certain number of epochs or iterations, achieving a desired level of accuracy or performance, observing a plateau in validation loss, or noticing overfitting. These criteria can vary depending on the specific model, dataset, and goals of the project. For more detailed information, additional context would be needed.
