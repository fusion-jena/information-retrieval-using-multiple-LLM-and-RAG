In the given context, the authors use a specific type of data splitting approach known as Random Year (RY) data splitting to prevent data bias during preprocessing of their deep learning pipeline. Unlike traditional random splitting methods, where individual observations are divided into training and testing sets without considering temporal factors, RY data splitting groups observations based on the year of capture and randomly selects years for inclusion in either dataset.

This method acknowledges that there might be systematic differences between the test and train datasets due to grouping by year but ensures that the model is evaluated using previously unseen combinations of explanatory variables. By doing so, they aim to create a more robust test of model performance in this particular context.

However, the text does not explicitly mention other common techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, while we can infer that the authors employ RY data splitting to mitigate potential biases related to time series data, we cannot comment on whether they utilize additional strategies like those mentioned above.
