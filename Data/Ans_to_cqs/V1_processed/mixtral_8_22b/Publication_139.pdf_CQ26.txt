The text does not provide explicit information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, there is mention of collecting audio data from various locations and times throughout the year, which could potentially help mitigate any biases related to location or time. Additionally, the use of log-mel spectrograms for representing audio data might also contribute to reducing certain types of biases, as they capture relevant features while discarding irrelevant ones. Nevertheless, without further details regarding the dataset and its potential biases, it is difficult to determine if these measures alone are sufficient to effectively address data bias during preprocessing.
