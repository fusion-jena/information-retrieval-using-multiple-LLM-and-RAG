Based on the given context, it does not appear that any specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) are mentioned in relation to a deep learning pipeline. Instead, the context discusses feature selection methods, specifically focusing on Forward Feature Selection (FFS) and its application in conjunction with logistic regression and random forest models. Additionally, the context mentions using the priorsense package to optimize the exploration of different configurations, but this seems unrelated to deep learning optimization techniques. Therefore, based solely on the provided information, I cannot provide details about the optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline.
