Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it can be inferred that the authors use a 3:1 train-test split for the occurrence points and evaluate the predictive accuracy of each model on the test data. The evaluation is done through two widely recognized metrics: the area under the curve (AUC) and the true skill statistic (TSS). The AUC values are categorized as excellent, good, moderate, or poor, while the TSS values are classified as excellent, good, or poor. Therefore, it can be assumed that the completion of training might depend on achieving satisfactory results according to these metrics. Nonetheless, without further details, it cannot be confirmed what exact criteria are used to determine when training is complete.
