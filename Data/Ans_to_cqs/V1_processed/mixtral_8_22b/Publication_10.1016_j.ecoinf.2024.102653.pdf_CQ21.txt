After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be taken to further analyze and understand the model's performance. Some common postprocessing techniques include calculating performance metrics, creating saliency maps, and generating confusion matrices.

Performance metrics are quantitative measures used to evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning models. In this study, conventional metrics like confusion matrices, accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, Cohen Kappa, and the area under the ROC curve were employed to gauge the model's performance. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to correctly classify instances, its sensitivity towards positive classes, and overall robustness.

Confusion matrices offer a visual representation of the model's predictions compared to actual values. They consist of four categories: true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. By examining these categories, one can determine the model's strengths and weaknesses in predicting certain classes.

Saliency maps are another useful tool for understanding deep learning models. They highlight areas within input data that significantly impact the model's output. By analyzing saliency maps, researchers can identify patterns and features that contribute most to the model's decision-making process. However, it is important to note that saliency maps were not explicitly mentioned in the given context; thus, their use may vary depending on the specific application and requirements.
