The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the provided context is for the classification of environmental microorganisms utilizing the capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) modules. This model, called EMViT-Net, was tested on a publicly available dataset of environmental microorganisms, EMDS-6, containing 21 categories of microorganisms using microscopic images. The goal of this model is to accurately classify these microorganisms based on their visual characteristics captured in the images. The model uses a separable convolutional parameter-sharing attention block to capture both local and global attention features, enabling efficient classification of various environmental microbes while reducing complexity. The performance of EMViT-Net was validated through comparison with other state-of-the-art models, demonstrating its superiority in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score.
