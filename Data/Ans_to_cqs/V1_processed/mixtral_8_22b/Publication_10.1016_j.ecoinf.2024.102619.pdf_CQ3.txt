The text does not provide explicit information about specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it mentions the importance of accurate and reliable annotations for large datasets, where manual analysis might be constrained due to time limitations. In this case, there is a trade-off between error rate and efficiency of the approaches used. Additionally, the text discusses using machine learning frameworks like PyTorch and Scikit-Learn for deep learning tasks, including data pre-processing, model selection, and evaluation. These frameworks could potentially support various data annotation techniques depending on the requirements of the project.
