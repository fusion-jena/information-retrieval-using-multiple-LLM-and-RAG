The text does not provide explicit information about the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions using burn-in steps, thinning steps, and multiple chains in the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. These techniques are often used to ensure convergence and stability in the sampling process, indirectly monitoring the model performance during training. Additionally, diagnostic plots are mentioned, which could have been used to assess the quality of the sampled parameters and the overall fit of the model. Therefore, while there isn't a direct mention of a specific strategy, these methods suggest that the authors monitored the model performance during training through various means such as convergence assessment, parameter quality checks, and overall model fit evaluation.
