Unfortunately, based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The text only provides details about the researcher, Dimitri Korsch, who works in the Computer Vision Group at Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Germany, but does not provide any links or references to the specific code repository used in their work. Therefore, without additional information, it is impossible to determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
