The given context does not provide information about the optimization of hyperparameters of any machine learning models used in the study. It only mentions the use of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) approach but does not discuss the optimization process of LDA hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based on the given context.
