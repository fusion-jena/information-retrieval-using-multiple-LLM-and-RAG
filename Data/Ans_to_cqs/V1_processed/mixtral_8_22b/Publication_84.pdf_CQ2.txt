The text does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the study investigates the application of phenological knowledge as input data for deep learning in detecting invasive S. alterniflora. This suggests that the data format could be related to remote sensing or satellite imagery, such as Landsat images, since these are commonly used for studying vegetation patterns and land cover changes. Additionally, the study compares the performance of Stacked AutoEncoders (SAE), a type of deep learning model, with Support Vector Machines (SVM), a traditional machine learning algorithm, indicating that the data format should be suitable for both models. In conclusion, while the exact data format is not specified, it can be inferred that the study uses some form of remote sensing or satellite imagery data for the deep learning pipeline.
