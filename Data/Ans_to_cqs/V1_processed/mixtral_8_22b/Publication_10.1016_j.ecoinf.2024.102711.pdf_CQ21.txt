The text does not provide explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it can be inferred that some common postprocessing steps might have been performed based on standard practices in machine learning. These could include metrics calculation, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score, to assess the model's performance. Additionally, creating a confusion matrix would help visualize the performance of the classifier by showing true positives, false negatives, false positives, and true negatives. Lastly, saliency maps may also be generated if the model is being used for image classification tasks, as they highlight important features contributing to the model's predictions.
