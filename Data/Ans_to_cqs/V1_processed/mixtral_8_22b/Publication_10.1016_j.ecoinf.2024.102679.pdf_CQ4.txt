The text does not provide specific details about the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that data augmentation was performed to increase the amount of available training data and improve the robustness of the models. Common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, and adjusting brightness or contrast. These techniques help create new variations of existing images, which can aid in training more accurate and generalizable models. Without explicit mention of the techniques used, one cannot definitively state which were implemented in this case.
