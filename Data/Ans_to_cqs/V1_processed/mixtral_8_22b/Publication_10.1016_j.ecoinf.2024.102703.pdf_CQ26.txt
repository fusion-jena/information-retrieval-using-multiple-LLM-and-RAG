Based on the given context, there isn't any direct information about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide some general insights regarding this topic.

Data bias can be addressed during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline using various techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of target classes in both sets. This ensures that the model learns from a representative sample of the entire dataset.

Oversampling is a technique where synthetic examples are generated from the minority class to balance the dataset. This helps prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.

Undersampling involves removing instances from the majority class to achieve a balanced dataset. While this may lead to loss of valuable information, it can help reduce overfitting and improve model performance.

Diverse data collection involves collecting data from different sources or demographics to ensure that the dataset is representative of the population. This can help mitigate bias caused by limited or skewed datasets.

In summary, addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline requires careful consideration of the dataset's characteristics and appropriate use of techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.
