The paper does not explicitly mention the specific deep learning framework used to build their models. However, they do cite a reference [34], which discusses Caffe, a popular deep learning framework developed by Berkeley AI Research. It can be inferred that the authors might have used Caffe or similar frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch to develop their deep learning models.
