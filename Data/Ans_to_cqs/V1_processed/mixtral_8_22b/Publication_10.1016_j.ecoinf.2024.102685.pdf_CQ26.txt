Based on the given context, it appears that the study focuses on using random forest classification for statistical analysis. However, there is no explicit mention of specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Nevertheless, some general techniques can be mentioned based on common practices in machine learning and deep learning pipelines. These include stratified splitting, which ensures that the class proportions in the training dataset remain similar to those in the overall dataset; oversampling, where samples from minority classes are duplicated to balance the dataset; undersampling, where samples from majority classes are reduced to achieve balance; and diverse data collection, which involves collecting more varied data to improve model performance. It should be noted that these techniques may not necessarily apply to this particular study without further information.
