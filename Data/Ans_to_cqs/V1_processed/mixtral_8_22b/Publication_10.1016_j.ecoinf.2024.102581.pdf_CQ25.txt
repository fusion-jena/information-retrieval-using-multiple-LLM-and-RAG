Based on the given context, it appears that the deep learning models mentioned are primarily used for classification tasks. For instance, the table shows various hyperparameters being explored for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which are commonly employed for image recognition and classification tasks. Furthermore, the context mentions specific applications such as pine tree classification, plant leaf disease classification, and plant disease classification, all of which fall under the category of classification problems. However, without additional information, I cannot definitively state whether other purposes like segmentation or detection are also part of the intended use cases for these models.
