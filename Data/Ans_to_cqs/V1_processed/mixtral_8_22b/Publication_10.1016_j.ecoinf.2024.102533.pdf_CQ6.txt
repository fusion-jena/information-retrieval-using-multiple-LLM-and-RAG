Based on the given context, it appears that there are several preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, the specific step mentioned in this context is data normalization. According to the text, the data normalization stage is considered unnecessary in this particular case. This suggests that data normalization might not always be required depending on the nature of the dataset or the problem being addressed. Other common preprocessing steps include scaling, cleaning, and transforming the data, but these are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, while we can confirm that data normalization was considered, further information would be needed to provide a comprehensive list of all preprocessing steps used in this study.
