In the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing the random seed value. However, some implicit techniques can be inferred from the information provided.

One common strategy to manage randomness in deep learning models is to use dropout regularization, which helps prevent overfitting by randomly dropping out neurons during training. This technique introduces randomness into the model, making it more robust and generalizable. In the context, reference [66] discusses dropout as a method to prevent neural networks from overfitting.

Additionally, the concept of cross-validation is often used to mitigate the impact of randomness in model selection and evaluation. Cross-validation involves splitting the dataset into several folds or subsets, where each fold serves as a validation set while the remaining folds form the training set. By repeating this process multiple times with different random seeds, one can obtain a more reliable estimate of the model's performance. Although not explicitly mentioned in the context, cross-validation could potentially be applied to evaluate the deep learning model's performance against the random forest model.

Lastly, another approach to handling randomness is through ensemble methods, which combine multiple models to improve overall performance. Ensemble methods can help reduce variance and increase stability in predictions. While not directly related to managing randomness due to random seed values, ensemble methods like bagging or boosting can still contribute to addressing the issue indirectly.

In summary, based on the given context, strategies such as dropout regularization, cross-validation, and ensemble methods can be employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, the context does not provide explicit details about how these strategies are specifically applied to address issues related to random seed values.
