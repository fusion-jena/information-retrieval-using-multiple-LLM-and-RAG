Based on the given context, it does not provide explicit information regarding the specific preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the DCNN model performs Local Response Normalization (LRN) processing and Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function processing in each layer except for the last fully connected layer. Additionally, the first, second, and fifth convolutional layers perform a downsampling operation using the mean pooling method. These operations could be considered part of the preprocessing or data preparation stage for the deep learning model. Nevertheless, without further details, it cannot be confirmed if these are the only preprocessing steps involved or if additional steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning were implemented prior to training the model.
