In the given context, it is mentioned that during the network training process, the input images underwent random rotations, flips, and other image augmentation operations to enhance the network's robustness. Therefore, the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include rotation and flipping. However, the specific details about scaling or any other augmentation technique used are not explicitly stated in the provided context.
