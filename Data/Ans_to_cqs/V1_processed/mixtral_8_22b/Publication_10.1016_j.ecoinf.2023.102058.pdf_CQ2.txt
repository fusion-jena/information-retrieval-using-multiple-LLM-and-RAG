The article discusses the use of hyperspectral data, specifically EnMAP simulated data, to predict water quality parameters such as Chl-a and TSS. Hyperspectral data is a type of remote sensing data that captures information across a wide range of wavelengths, providing detailed spectral signatures of objects or materials being observed. In this case, the hyperspectral data is derived from airborne imagery captured by the AISA Eagle sensor and then processed through the EnMAP End-to-End Simulator (EeteS) to generate simulated EnMAP scenes. These simulated scenes serve as input to the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is hyperspectral imagery.
