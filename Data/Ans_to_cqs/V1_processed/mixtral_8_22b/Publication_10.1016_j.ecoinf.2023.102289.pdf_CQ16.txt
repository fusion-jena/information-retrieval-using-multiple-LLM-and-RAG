Based on the given context, there isn't any information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, common practices include monitoring metrics such as validation loss, accuracy, or performance on a separate test dataset. When these metrics reach a satisfactory level or stop improving significantly over several epochs, it may indicate that training has converged and can be stopped. Please consult additional resources or documentation related to the specific AI platform being used for more detailed guidance.
