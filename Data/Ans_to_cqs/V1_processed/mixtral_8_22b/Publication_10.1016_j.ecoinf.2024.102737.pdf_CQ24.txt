The context does not provide specific information about strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, common practices include setting a fixed random seed value before running experiments or averaging results over multiple runs with different random seeds to ensure reproducibility and reduce variability due to random initialization.
