The query asks about strategies used to manage randomness in the deep learning pipeline, specifically regarding random seed values. However, based on the given context, there is no direct information or discussion related to this topic. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based solely on the provided context.

To address the query, some common strategies used to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using ensemble methods to average out the effect of random initializations, and employing techniques like dropout regularization to introduce controlled randomness during model training. These strategies help improve the robustness and generalizability of deep learning models.
