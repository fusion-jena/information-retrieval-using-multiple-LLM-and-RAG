The study primarily focuses on using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model for Land-use and Land-cover Classification (LCLU) within the Talassemtane National Park (TNP), utilizing Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. This indicates that the main data format employed in this deep learning pipeline is image data. Specifically, the researchers utilized spectral indices derived from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to create a dataset for training their DNN model. These spectral indices provide valuable information about various aspects of the landscape, such as vegetation health, water content, and soil composition. By leveraging these spectral indices, the researchers could effectively differentiate between six distinct land use classes within the TNP.

In summary, the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is image data, specifically the spectral indices extracted from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Other common data formats like audio, video, or CSV files do not appear to be relevant to this particular study.
