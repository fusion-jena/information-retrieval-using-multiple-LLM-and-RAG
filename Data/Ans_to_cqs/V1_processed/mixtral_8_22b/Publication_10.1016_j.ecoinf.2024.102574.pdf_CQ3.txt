The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. However, some papers do discuss methods related to object detection and classification, which often involve data annotation techniques such as bounding boxes or semantic/instance segmentation.

For example, Marrs & Ni-Meister (2019) use machine learning techniques for tree species classification using co-registered LiDAR and hyperspectral data. This could potentially involve annotating trees with their respective species labels. Similarly, Qin et al. (2022) focus on individual tree segmentation and tree species classification in subtropical broadleaf forests using various types of data, including UAV-based LiDAR, hyperspectral, and ultrahigh-resolution RGB data. Again, this likely involves some form of data annotation to identify individual trees and assign them appropriate classifications.

In general, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include:

1. Bounding Box Annotation: Drawing rectangles around objects within images to define their location and size.
2. Semantic Segmentation: Labeling each pixel in an image according to its corresponding category or class.
3. Instance Segmentation: Similar to semantic segmentation but also distinguishing between instances of the same class.
4. Polygon Annotation: Outlining complex shapes or boundaries within images using polygons.
5. Keypoint Annotation: Identifying key points or landmarks on objects within images.

Without more specific information from the given context, it cannot be determined exactly which data annotation techniques were employed in these studies.
