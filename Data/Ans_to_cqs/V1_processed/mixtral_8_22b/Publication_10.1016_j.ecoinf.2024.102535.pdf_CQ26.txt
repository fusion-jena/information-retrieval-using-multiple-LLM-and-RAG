In the given context, while no explicit mention of specific techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection is made, there is an indication of dealing with class imbalance. Class imbalance is one form of data bias where certain classes have more representation than others, leading to potential biases in the classifier's predictions.

To mitigate this issue, the authors state that they addressed class imbalance in their work. However, the exact methodology employed is not detailed within the provided context. Therefore, while it is clear that some technique(s) were implemented to handle data bias related to class imbalance, the precise strategies remain unknown from the information available.
