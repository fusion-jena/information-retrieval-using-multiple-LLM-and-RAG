The given context does not provide information on where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions various satellite image sources and sensors used but does not specify any specific data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I do not have enough information to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
