The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in this context is not explicitly stated. However, based on the information given, it can be inferred that the model is designed for object detection, specifically for detecting cow vocalizations. This is supported by the mention of using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Deep Learning methods for automated cattle detection, and the use of Kaleidoscope Pro software for automatic detection of cow calls. Additionally, the text mentions the need for manual validation of Regions of Interest (ROIs) detected by Kaleidoscope Pro, suggesting that the model generates potential areas where cow vocalizations might occur, which then require human verification. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model serves the purpose of detecting cow vocalizations in audio data.
