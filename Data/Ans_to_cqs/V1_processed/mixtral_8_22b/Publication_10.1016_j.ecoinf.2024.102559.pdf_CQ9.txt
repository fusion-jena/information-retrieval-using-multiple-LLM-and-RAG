The information provided does not explicitly mention where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, one dataset mentioned in the context is the "Santa Barbara County coast (2020)" dataset, which can be found in the Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity (KNB) repository. This suggests that datasets related to this topic might be stored in similar repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. To find the specific location of the deep learning pipeline data repository, further research would need to be conducted.
