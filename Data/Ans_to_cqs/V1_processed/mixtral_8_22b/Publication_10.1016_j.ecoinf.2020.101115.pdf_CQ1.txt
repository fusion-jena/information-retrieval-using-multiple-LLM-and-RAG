Based on the given context, there isn't specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, we do have some insights into the type of data being handled. The text mentions a fish scale and otolith collection consisting of thousands of samples dating back to 1928. It also discusses the importance of certain metadata like fish sampling location, date, species, and life stage. From this, we can infer that the raw data might include images or scans of these fish scales and otoliths, along with their associated metadata. As for the method of collection, it could involve manual extraction and preservation of these biological structures from various fish species over time. But without explicit mention of survey methods, sensor use, or public datasets, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding those aspects.
