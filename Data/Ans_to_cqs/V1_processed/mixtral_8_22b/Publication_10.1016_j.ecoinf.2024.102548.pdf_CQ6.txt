Unfortunately, there isn't any explicit mention of preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model in the given context. However, it can be generally stated that common preprocessing steps include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and augmentation. Normalization scales numerical input features to a range between 0 and 1, which helps prevent certain features from dominating others due to their scale. Scaling ensures all features have similar magnitudes, reducing bias towards larger values. Cleaning removes noise and outliers from the data, improving overall quality. Data augmentation generates new examples by applying transformations to existing ones, increasing the size of the dataset and helping the model generalize better. These preprocessing steps may vary depending on the nature of the problem and the type of data being used.
