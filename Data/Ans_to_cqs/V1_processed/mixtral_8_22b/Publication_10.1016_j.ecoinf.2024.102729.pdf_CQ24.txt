Based on the given context, there is no direct mention or discussion about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it does discuss the use of random forests (RF) in analyzing spatial and temporal variation in water coverage in the sub-lakes of Poyang Lake.

Random forests are a type of ensemble learning technique that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy. They work by creating a collection of decision trees from a subset of the original data and then aggregating their predictions. This approach helps reduce overfitting and improves generalization.

In the context provided, the authors used RF algorithms to establish models with high predictive capacity. To maintain the covariance structure among the predictor variables relatively intact between the training and testing datasets, they opted for random sampling instead of cluster sampling.

While not directly related to handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, this example demonstrates how randomness can be managed within the context of machine learning algorithms like RF. By employing random sampling and maintaining the covariance structure, the researchers aimed to ensure that their models could accurately capture patterns in the data without being influenced by specific biases introduced during the sampling process.
