The study utilizes the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to collect raw data for its deep learning pipeline. GEE is a cloud-based geoprocessing platform with considerable quantities of geospatial data publicly available. This includes a multipetabyte catalog of satellite imagery, such as Landsat imagery. The present study specifically uses GEE to retrieve atmospherically corrected United States Geological Survey Landsat Surface reflectance products. These products are then used for further analysis and processing within the deep learning pipeline. No other specific methods or sources for collecting raw data are mentioned in the given context.
