Unfortunately, there is no information available regarding the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model mentioned in the given context. Therefore, it is not possible to provide an accurate answer to this query based solely on the provided information.

However, generally speaking, deep learning models often require substantial computing power and memory capacity to train efficiently. As such, they are commonly trained on specialized hardware devices such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). These devices offer high levels of parallel processing capabilities, which enable them to perform complex mathematical operations required for training deep learning models more quickly and efficiently compared to traditional Central Processing Units (CPUs).

Therefore, while I cannot confirm the exact hardware resources used for training the deep learning model discussed in the given context, it is reasonable to assume that some form of specialized hardware device was likely utilized to facilitate efficient training.
