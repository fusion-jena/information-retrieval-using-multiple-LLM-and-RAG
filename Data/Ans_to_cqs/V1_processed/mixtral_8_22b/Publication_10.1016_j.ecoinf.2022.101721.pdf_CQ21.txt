The provided context does not directly mention any specific postprocessing steps involved after model training such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, confusion matrix etc. However, it does discuss the use of Bayesian statistics and ultrasound analysis for ecological informatics. It mentions that all statistics and production of figures were done in GNU R version 3.6.1 (R Core Team, 2019) or QGIS version 3.16 (QGIS Development Team, 2018). Additionally, it states that examples are given in the form of a simple artwork, and also through R-code, with the full R-code being available in supplement S1. Therefore, while the exact postprocessing steps are not mentioned, one could infer that they might involve generating visualizations and performing further analyses using tools like R and QGIS.
