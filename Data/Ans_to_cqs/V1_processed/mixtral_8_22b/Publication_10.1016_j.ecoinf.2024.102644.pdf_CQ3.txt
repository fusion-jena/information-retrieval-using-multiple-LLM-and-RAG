The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses the use of big data mining approaches based on artificial intelligence models to predict biodiversity changes. In this case, the data used is likely related to species observations, which could involve various forms of annotation depending on the model requirements. For example, bounding box annotation or instance segmentation might be used if object detection or semantic segmentation tasks were part of the deep learning pipeline. But without more specific information about the models being used, it's impossible to definitively state what annotation techniques are employed.
