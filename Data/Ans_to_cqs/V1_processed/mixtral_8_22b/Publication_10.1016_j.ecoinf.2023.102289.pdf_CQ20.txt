High-quality Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are essential for LaDeco, which processes image data. For instance, a computer with 128GB RAM, an Intel-i9 CPU, and a Nvidia-RTX5000 GPU was used to analyze a total of 8301 images, taking a total time of 5087 seconds (an average of 0.61 seconds per image). To improve processing speed, especially when dealing with large datasets, using more advanced GPUs is recommended. However, the specific type of GPU used for training the deep learning model is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. Therefore, while we know that GPUs are important for running LaDeco, the exact GPU used for training the deep learning model remains unknown.
