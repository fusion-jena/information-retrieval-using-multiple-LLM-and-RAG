The given context does not provide information on the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it mentions the use of OpenSoundscape (<http://opensoundscape.org/en/latest/>), a platform that enables users to create custom Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for detecting and identifying species from field-collected acoustic data. This suggests that the authors may have utilized this platform for developing their deep learning models. Nevertheless, without explicit mention of a cloud service provider like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform, we cannot definitively determine which platform was employed for model deployment.
