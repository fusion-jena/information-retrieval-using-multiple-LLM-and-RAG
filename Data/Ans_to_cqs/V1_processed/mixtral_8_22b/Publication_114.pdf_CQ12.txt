The pipeline uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for tree species classification. Specifically, the study adopts AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet50 implemented in Caffe for individual tree identification. These networks have been popular in the field of image classification since the publication of AlexNet. The choice of CNNs is suitable due to their effectiveness in handling spatial data such as images.

Unhelpful 
The pipeline does not use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers for tree species classification. Instead, it employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), specifically AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet50.
