Unfortunately, based on the given information, it is not possible to determine which specific frameworks were used to build the deep learning models mentioned in this context. While the text discusses various machine learning techniques such as artificial neural networks (ANN) and extreme machine learning, it does not specify the exact libraries or frameworks employed to implement these methods. Therefore, without additional details, we cannot definitively state whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other particular framework was utilized.
