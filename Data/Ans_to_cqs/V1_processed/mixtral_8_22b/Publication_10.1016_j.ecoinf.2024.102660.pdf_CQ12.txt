The study uses a modified version of the UNet convolutional neural network (CNN). Specifically, it integrates the Convolutional Block Attention Module into the encoding-decoding skip connections of the network and refines the convolutional blocks to improve feature extraction related to water sun glint. Additionally, residual structures are added to prevent overfitting, and the number of convolutional kernels within each block is reduced. Therefore, the deep learning model used in this pipeline is a customized CNN based on the UNet architecture.
