The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, based on the references cited, it appears that the deep learning model may be used for species distribution modeling or ecological niche modeling. These types of models are often used to predict the potential geographic distribution of a species based on environmental variables such as temperature, precipitation, and elevation. They can also be used to identify areas where a species is likely to occur based on its known habitat preferences. Some common applications of these models include conservation planning, invasive species management, and disease risk assessment. Without more specific details about the model being discussed, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer regarding its exact purpose.
