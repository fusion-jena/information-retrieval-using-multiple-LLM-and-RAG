Based on the given context, it appears there isn't direct information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. However, generally speaking, some common criteria used to determine when training is complete include:

1. Validation Loss Plateau: Training can be considered complete when the validation loss stops decreasing significantly with each epoch. This indicates that the model has learned all it can from the data and further training may lead to overfitting.

2. Maximum Number of Epochs: Training can also be stopped after a predefined maximum number of epochs. This is useful when resources are limited or when the learning curve shows diminishing returns.

3. Early Stopping: This technique involves monitoring the performance of the model on a validation set during training. When the performance on the validation set starts to degrade, even if the training loss continues to decrease, training is halted.

4. Learning Rate Schedule: Some models use a learning rate schedule where the learning rate is reduced after a certain number of epochs. Once the learning rate reaches a minimum value, training is considered complete.
