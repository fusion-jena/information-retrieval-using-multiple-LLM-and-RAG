The researchers took several measures to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. They conducted their research in various regions representative of diverse European environments. This allowed them to gather data from multiple locations, ensuring that the model was exposed to a wide range of scenarios. Additionally, they employed data augmentation techniques during the training phase. These techniques included varying lighting conditions, which helped simulate seasonal or daily variations in environmental conditions. By incorporating these strategies, the researchers aimed to enhance the robustness and adaptability of their model, enabling its application in different geographical settings across Europe.
