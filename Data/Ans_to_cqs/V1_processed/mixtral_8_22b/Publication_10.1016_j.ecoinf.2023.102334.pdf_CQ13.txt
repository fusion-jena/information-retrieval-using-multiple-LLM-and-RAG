The text does not provide explicit details about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the type of optimizer employed. However, it mentions that the model uses L2 regularization for learning. Additionally, the machine configuration information table indicates that Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow were utilized for data processing. These tools often include various options for setting hyperparameters like learning rates, optimizers, and others. Without further context or information, it cannot be determined which exact values or types of these hyperparameters were chosen for the deep learning model.
