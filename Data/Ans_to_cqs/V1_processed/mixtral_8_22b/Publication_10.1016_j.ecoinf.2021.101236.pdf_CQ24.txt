The given context does not explicitly mention any specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it is common practice in deep learning to use techniques like setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, employing cross-validation methods, and utilizing ensemble models to mitigate the effects of randomness. These strategies help ensure consistent results across different runs and improve overall model performance.
