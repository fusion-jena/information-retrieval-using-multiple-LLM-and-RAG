The given context does not provide any direct reference or link to the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide the exact link to the code repository. However, some clues from the text suggest that the authors might have used popular deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch, along with other tools like the Deep Learning Toolbox by MathWorks, cuDNN, and Darknet. These libraries usually have their own repositories on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. To find the specific code repository related to the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the paper, one would need more detailed information or search for relevant keywords on these platforms.
