Based on the provided context, it appears that the research primarily focuses on using machine learning techniques, specifically clustering methods, rather than deep learning models. However, I can still address the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of their findings.

Firstly, the researchers used a diverse dataset consisting of seven fish species, which helps improve the applicability of their results across various types of fish. This diversity in the dataset contributes to the generalizability of the proposed methodology.

Secondly, although the text does not explicitly mention cross-validation or stratified splitting, it discusses generating a dataset over 11 days. This timeframe suggests that the researchers collected data points throughout multiple stages of fish decay, capturing varying levels of freshness. By doing so, they likely aimed to create a comprehensive dataset that covers a wide range of possible scenarios, further enhancing the robustness and generalizability of their model.

Lastly, while the authors do not directly discuss employing cross-validation or stratified splitting techniques, these methods are commonly used in machine learning studies to evaluate model performance and prevent overfitting. Given that the paper presents a machine learning experiment, it is reasonable to assume that such practices might have been implemented during the development and evaluation phases of the model. Nevertheless, without explicit confirmation in the provided context, this point remains speculative.
