Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. However, some details regarding the implementation and hardware used during experimentation are mentioned.

The deep learning-based models employed in this research were developed using TensorFlow, a Python framework designed for efficient analysis and implementation of deep learning with GPUs. The experiments were carried out on a 64-bit Intel i7-8700K@3.70GHz CPU workstation equipped with 64GB memory and an NVIDIAÂ® GTX 1080 GPU with 12GB of memory. The operating system utilized was Debian 4.195.98-1 version.

While these details provide insight into the development environment and hardware requirements, they do not directly address the deployment process. Therefore, based on the available context, I cannot provide a detailed description of the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
