The papers provided do not explicitly mention any specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, scaling, etc., which are commonly used in image processing tasks within deep learning pipelines. These techniques help increase the amount of training data by creating modified versions of images in the dataset.

However, it should be noted that the paper by Do and Tran (2023) discusses using a deep learning model for detection purposes, but does not provide details about their preprocessing steps or whether they employed any data augmentation techniques. Similarly, other papers focus on various aspects of marine biology and ecology without discussing specific machine learning methodologies or data augmentation strategies.

It is important to remember that data augmentation techniques depend heavily on the nature of the task and the type of input data being processed. For instance, applying geometric transformations like flipping, rotating, or scaling may not always be suitable for non-image datasets. Therefore, while these techniques are popular in computer vision applications, they might not necessarily apply to all deep learning projects.
