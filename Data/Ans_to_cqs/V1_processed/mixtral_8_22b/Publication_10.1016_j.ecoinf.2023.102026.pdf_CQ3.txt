The given context does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of Random Forest (RF) algorithms, which are a type of machine learning technique often used for classification or regression tasks. The context also discusses the use of these algorithms for investigating the most representative scales for each covariate, and the application of two different training data selection frameworks for RF. Unfortunately, there is no mention of any data annotation techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.
