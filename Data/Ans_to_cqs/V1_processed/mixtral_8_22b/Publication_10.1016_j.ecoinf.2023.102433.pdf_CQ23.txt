Based on the given context, there is no information about any specific deep learning models or their development process. Therefore, it is impossible to determine what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of such a model. The context primarily discusses various aspects of NASA Web Services, including its architecture, interfaces, and methods, along with some references to related literature. However, none of these details provide insight into the creation or validation of a deep learning model.
