The given context does not provide information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine which datasets were used for training and testing the models. Some commonly used datasets in deep learning include MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet, but without further context, it is impossible to confirm if any of these datasets were utilized in this case.
