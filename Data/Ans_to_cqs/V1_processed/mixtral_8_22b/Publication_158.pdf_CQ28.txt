The text does not provide information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it mentions that all Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were trained using the TensorFlow backend on a Tesla M100 graphics processing unit (GPU). This suggests that the development and training of the deep learning model took place within an environment compatible with TensorFlow and utilizing a Tesla M100 GPU. Unfortunately, without further details, we cannot determine whether the model was deployed on platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform.
