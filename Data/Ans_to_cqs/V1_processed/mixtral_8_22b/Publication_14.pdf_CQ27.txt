Based on the given context, it appears that the trained deep learning model was deployed through an executable called DeepMeerkat, which is available for both Mac and Windows platforms. This executable includes the pre-trained hummingbird model. Additionally, there are also reproducible scripts provided for local and Google cloud environments to enable users to train new models, which can then be utilized within the local software. However, the specific details regarding the exact process of model deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection, are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
