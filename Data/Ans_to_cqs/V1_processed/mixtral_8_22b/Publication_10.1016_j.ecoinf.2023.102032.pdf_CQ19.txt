The article does not provide information on which specific framework was used to build the deep learning model for improving cloud detection with machine learning. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other framework was utilized based solely on this source. For a more definitive answer, additional resources would need to be consulted.
