Based on the given context, there isn't enough information to provide the exact data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. However, the text mentions that users can retrieve the EOS data catalogue from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) online repository using the ee.ImageCollection() constructor. This suggests that the data might be available in the GEE online repository. You can access this repository by visiting <https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/>. Please note that without additional context or information about the specific dataset required, I cannot provide a more precise answer.
