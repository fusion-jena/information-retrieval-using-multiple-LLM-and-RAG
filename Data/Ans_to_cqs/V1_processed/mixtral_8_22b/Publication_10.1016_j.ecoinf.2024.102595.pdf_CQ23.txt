To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were implemented. Firstly, the preprocessed data was divided into three distinct subsets: training (80%), validation (10%), and test sets (10%). This division allowed for comprehensive model training and testing, with the larger proportion allocated to the training set aimed at enhancing the model's ability to learn patterns within the data.

Secondly, the predictive models were constructed using both deep learning algorithms (such as Deep Neural Networks) and traditional machine learning approaches (like AdaBoost Regressor and Support Vector Regressor). This approach enabled the exploration of various modeling strategies, thereby increasing the likelihood of identifying the most effective method for the given task.

Thirdly, hyperparameter tuning was conducted through GridSearchCV with cross-validation (cv = 10). This technique systematically searches across a predefined grid of hyperparameter values, ensuring that the final selection of hyperparameters is based on empirical evidence rather than arbitrary decisions. Moreover, the implementation of tenfold cross-validation provided a robust estimate of the model's performance, striking a balance between bias and variance while safeguarding against overfitting.

Lastly, the test set, which remained unseen by the model during the training and validation stages, served as an indicator of the model's performance in real-world scenarios. By evaluating the model's performance on this separate subset of data, it was possible to gauge its capacity to generalize beyond the training data.

These combined efforts—including diverse dataset partitioning, application of multiple modeling techniques, rigorous hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation on a separate test set—collectively contributed to enhancing the generalizability of the deep learning model.
