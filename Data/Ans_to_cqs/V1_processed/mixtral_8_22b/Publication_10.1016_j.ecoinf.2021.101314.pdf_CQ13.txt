Based on the given context, there is no information regarding the use of a deep learning model or any specific hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer. Instead, the text discusses a method that involves manually setting several parameters, which are detailed in a user guide. These parameters include thresholds on the size of the support of the output redescriptions and controls for the length and complexity of their queries. Some examples of these parameters mentioned in the context are MinSuppIn (at least 1% of localities satisfying both queries) and MinSuppOut (at least 30% of localities satisfying neither of the queries). However, these do not correspond directly to typical deep learning hyperparameters like learning rate or optimizer. Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot provide the requested information about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model.
