The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the macro F1 score as the main metric due to the significant imbalance of classes in the datasets. Additionally, the corresponding macro precision and macro recall values are provided in Appendix A. It is important to note that the focus of this study was not on optimizing for accuracy metrics like the F1 Score but rather on identifying efficient strategies that combine transfer learning and active learning. However, potential ways to improve accuracy mentioned include applying Per-Channel Energy Normalization (PCEN), refining spectrogram feature engineering, or employing transfer learning with fine-tuning.
