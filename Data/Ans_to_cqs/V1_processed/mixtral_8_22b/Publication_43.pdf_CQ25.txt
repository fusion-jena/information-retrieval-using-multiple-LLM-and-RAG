The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is for classification. Specifically, it is designed to classify between two types of land cover: Ziziphus lotus shrubs and bare soil with sparse vegetation. This is evident from the statement "We identified 100 80 Ã— 80-pixel image patches containing Ziziphus lotus shrubs and 100 images for Bare soil with sparse vegetation." Furthermore, the table presented in the text also indicates that the model was trained and tested using these two classes. Therefore, the primary goal of this deep learning model is to accurately distinguish between these two types of land cover.
