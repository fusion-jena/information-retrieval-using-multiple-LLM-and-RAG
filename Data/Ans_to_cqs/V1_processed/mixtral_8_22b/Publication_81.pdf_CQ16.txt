The article does not provide information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, common criteria used in machine learning include observing a plateau or decrease in validation loss, achieving a predefined level of accuracy or another metric, or setting a maximum number of epochs or iterations. These criteria help prevent overfitting and ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data.
