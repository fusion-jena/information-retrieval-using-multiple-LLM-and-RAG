The provided context does not explicitly mention specific methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the context that satellite imagery is one source of raw data used in deep learning applications related to remote sensing and vegetation species discrimination. For instance, references [22], [24], and [26] discuss using high spatial resolution satellite data for semantic segmentation tasks involving Brazilian savanna vegetation and scattered shrub detection. Additionally, reference [23] mentions using tree counts obtained through satellite images for studying West African Sahara and Sahel regions. Therefore, it can be concluded that satellite imagery is a common method for gathering raw data in this domain. Other potential sources of raw data could include drones or other types of aerial photography, but these are not mentioned in the given context.
