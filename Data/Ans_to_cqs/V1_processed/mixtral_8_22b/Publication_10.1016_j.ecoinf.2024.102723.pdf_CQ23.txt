Based on the given information, there isn't any explicit mention of specific techniques like diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting being employed to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does state that the study focuses on scenarios with limited datasets, suggesting that the authors might have been working under resource constraints.

Furthermore, the paper discusses the use of Bayesian Deep Learning models, which inherently address some aspects of generalization due to their ability to handle uncertainties associated with the data and the model itself. This property could help improve the robustness and reliability of the model when dealing with new, unseen data.

Additionally, the performance evaluation includes various metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE), and Normalized Median Positive Interval Width (NMPIW). These metrics not only assess the accuracy of the model but also evaluate its capability to generate reliable prediction intervals, contributing to the overall confidence in the model's generalizability.
