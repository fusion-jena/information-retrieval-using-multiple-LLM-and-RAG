In the given context, various machine learning algorithms have been discussed along with their respective techniques to prevent overfitting. However, the specific topic of deep learning pipelines and its regularization methods like dropout and L2 regularization are not explicitly mentioned. Nevertheless, some relevant insights can be drawn from the text.

For instance, in the case of Support Vector Machines (SVM), the parameter 'c' is used to control the trade-off between achieving a low error on the training set and having a large margin. By increasing the value of 'c', one can reduce the margin width, thereby making the classifier more prone to overfitting. On the contrary, decreasing the value of 'c' increases the margin width, reducing the chances of overfitting but possibly leading to a higher bias. Therefore, tuning the 'c' value appropriately helps maintain a balance between the margin size and overfitting.

Similarly, while discussing Random Forests (RF), it is stated that careful tuning and hyperparameterization, such as'mtry' and 'ntree,' are required to prevent overfitting. Adjusting these parameters correctly ensures a balance between model stability and minimizing the root mean square error (RMSE).

Lastly, when describing Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), the use of calibration parameters like the learning rate and weight is mentioned to enhance performance. Furthermore, the regularization parameter 'decay' is employed to evade overfitting. In this context, the optimal combination of parameters for the best model fit is determined based on accuracy.

Although the context does not directly address the query about regularization methods in deep learning pipelines, it highlights the importance of appropriate parameter tuning and hyperparameter optimization across different machine learning models to prevent overfitting. These principles could also apply to deep learning architectures where regularization methods like dropout and L2 regularization play crucial roles in preventing overfitting.
