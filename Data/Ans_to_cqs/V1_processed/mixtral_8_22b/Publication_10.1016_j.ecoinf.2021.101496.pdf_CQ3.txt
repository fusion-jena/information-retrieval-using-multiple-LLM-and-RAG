The given context does not provide information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it can be inferred from the context that image analysis is being conducted using Python programming language and tools like Raspberry Pi and Pi Camera. These tools could potentially be used for various tasks related to computer vision and machine learning, including data annotation. Nevertheless, without explicit mention of the data annotation techniques employed in this study, we cannot definitively state which ones have been utilized.
