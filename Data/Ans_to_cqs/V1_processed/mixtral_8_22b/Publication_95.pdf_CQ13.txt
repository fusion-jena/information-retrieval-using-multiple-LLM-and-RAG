In this case, the deep learning model used is a ResNet50V2 model. The optimization algorithm used is Adam with a learning rate of 0.001. The loss function used is cross-entropy loss. These are all considered hyperparameters of the model. Other hyperparameters such as batch size, number of epochs, and specific architecture details like layer types and dimensions are not explicitly mentioned but could also be considered part of the overall model configuration.
