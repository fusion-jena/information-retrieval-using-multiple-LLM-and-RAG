The text does not provide explicit information regarding the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, it mentions that statistics with values <1.05 provide support for convergence, which suggests that convergence might be one criterion considered. Additionally, there is mention of an adaptive phase of 2000 iterations and sampling from posterior distributions using three Markov chains each of length 20,000 to ensure convergence, along with a burn-in period of 5000. These details suggest that the completion of training may involve reaching a certain number of iterations or achieving convergence based on statistical measures.
