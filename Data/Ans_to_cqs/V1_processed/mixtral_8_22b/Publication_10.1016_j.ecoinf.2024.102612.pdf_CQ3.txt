The text does not provide explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the given context, we can infer that some form of semantic segmentation was applied to both synthetic and real multi-spectral (MS) point cloud data. This involved creating a ground truth dataset for validation purposes, likely through manual labeling or an automated process. Additionally, the use of a decision tree scheme suggests further processing and categorization of the labeled data. While the exact methods used for data annotation are not specified, common techniques for semantic segmentation include pixel-wise labeling, polygon annotation, and instance segmentation.
