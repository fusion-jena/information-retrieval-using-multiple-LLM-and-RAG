Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it can be inferred that the authors might have used standard practices such as tracking metrics like accuracy, loss, or F1 scores during the training process. Additionally, they could have employed techniques like cross-validation or using separate datasets for training, validation, and testing to ensure the model's robustness and prevent overfitting.
