Although the given context does not explicitly mention specific optimization techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), it provides insights into the application of deep learning methods in ecology. The papers cited discuss various applications of deep learning models, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) for tasks like streamflow forecasting, air quality prediction, and water resource management.

Optimization techniques are crucial components of any deep learning pipeline, as they help minimize the loss function during the training process. While the context does not directly address these techniques, it is important to note that popular optimization algorithms like SGD and Adam are commonly employed in deep learning pipelines.

SGD is a simple yet effective optimization technique that updates the weights of the model iteratively based on the gradient of the loss function. On the other hand, Adam combines the advantages of both SGD and another optimization algorithm called Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp) to adaptively adjust the learning rate for each weight individually.

In conclusion, while the given context does not specifically mention optimization techniques like SGD or Adam, their use is implicit when employing deep learning models in ecological studies. These optimization techniques play a vital role in improving the accuracy and efficiency of deep learning models in various ecological applications.
