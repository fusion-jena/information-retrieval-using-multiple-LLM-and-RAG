Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some strategies can be inferred indirectly. For instance, during the preprocessing phase, augmentation techniques like random saturation adjustments are applied to introduce variations in color intensity. This approach contributes to creating a more comprehensive and robust training dataset by increasing the number of outputs per example. Additionally, the dataset is divided into three sets - training, validation, and testing - which helps ensure the model's generalizability and prevents overfitting. While these methods do not directly address randomness in the form of random seed values, they contribute to mitigating potential issues arising from randomness in the input data.
