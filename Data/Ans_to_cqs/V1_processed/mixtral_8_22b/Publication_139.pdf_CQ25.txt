The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is for classification. Specifically, it is designed to classify bird species based on their vocalizations within soundscape recordings. This is evident through various mentions of its application in bird species classification challenges, such as BirdCLEF and DCASE, where it has achieved state-of-the-art performance for advanced classification tasks. Additionally, the use of transfer learning techniques, such as retraining pre-trained models like Inception, MobileNet, and Resnet50, further supports the notion that the primary goal of the model is classification.
