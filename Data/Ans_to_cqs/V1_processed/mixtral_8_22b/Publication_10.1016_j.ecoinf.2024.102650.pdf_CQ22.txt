The given context does not provide information about the specific evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the deep learning model. However, common metrics used to evaluate deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), among others. These metrics help measure how well the model is performing and its ability to generalize to unseen data. Without additional context, it cannot be definitively stated which metrics were used in this case.
