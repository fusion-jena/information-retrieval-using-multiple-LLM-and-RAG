The article does not provide explicit information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It mentions the use of deep neural networks and provides details about their implementation but does not specify where the dataset used for training or testing these models can be accessed. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if the data repository is available on platforms such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Further research would be required to locate the relevant datasets.
