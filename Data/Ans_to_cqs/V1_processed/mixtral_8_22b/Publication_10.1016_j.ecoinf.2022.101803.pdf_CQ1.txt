The given context does not provide specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions real-life datasets such as the sparrow population dataset and simulated datasets like those found in Matthiopoulos et al. (2015) and Matthiopoulos et al. (2011). These datasets could have been collected using various methods such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. Without further context, it cannot be determined exactly how these datasets were gathered.
