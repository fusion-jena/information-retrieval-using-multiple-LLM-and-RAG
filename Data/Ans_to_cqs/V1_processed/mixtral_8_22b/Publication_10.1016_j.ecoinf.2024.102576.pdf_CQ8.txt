Unfortunately, the given context does not provide any specific details about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only discusses the application of deep learning models, specifically the U-Net model, for land-cover classification and extraction of ecological information. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is located.
