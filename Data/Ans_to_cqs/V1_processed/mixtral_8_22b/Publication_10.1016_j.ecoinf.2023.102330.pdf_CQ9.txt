The given context does not provide information on where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The text discusses using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for acoustic detection, training them, and applying data augmentation techniques. It mentions the study area but does not specify any details about the data repository location. Therefore, based on this context alone, we cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
