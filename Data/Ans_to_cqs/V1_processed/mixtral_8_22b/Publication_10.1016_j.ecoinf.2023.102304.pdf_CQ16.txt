The text does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete or if validation loss plateaus are considered. However, it mentions that the LTR parameters were optimized using the kappa coefficient to evaluate the detection accuracy for different indices and parameter sets. This suggests that the optimization process may involve evaluating the performance of the model during training and adjusting parameters accordingly until satisfactory results are achieved.
