The text does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses the challenges posed by big data and the potential solutions offered by AI tools, particularly in the context of camera trap studies. The authors suggest that no single approach is likely to be optimal for all study systems, emphasizing the importance of making informed and intentional decisions about which methods to use based on study-specific conditions.

While the text does not directly address data bias, it implies that diverse data collection could be crucial in improving the performance of AI models. For instance, incorporating more training data in model development would likely enhance its accuracy and applicability across different scenarios. Additionally, stratified sampling, oversampling, and undersampling are commonly employed techniques to mitigate data bias during preprocessing. Stratified sampling involves dividing the dataset into homogeneous subgroups before applying random sampling within each group. Oversampling increases the number of instances in the minority class, while undersampling reduces the number of instances in the majority class. These techniques aim to balance the distribution of classes in the dataset, thereby minimizing bias and enhancing the overall performance of the deep learning pipeline.
