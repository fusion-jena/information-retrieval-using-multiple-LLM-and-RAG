Unfortunately, there isn't any explicit mention of optimization techniques used in the given context. However, I can provide some general insights about commonly used optimization techniques in deep learning pipelines.

Optimization techniques play a crucial role in improving the accuracy and speeding up the convergence of deep learning models during training. Some popular optimization algorithms include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Momentum, Adagrad, RMSprop, and Adam.

1. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD): SGD updates the parameters iteratively based on the gradient of the loss function calculated over a single example or a small batch of examples. It is computationally efficient but may converge slowly due to noisy estimates of the true gradient.

2. Momentum: Momentum helps accelerate SGD by adding a fraction of the update vector from the previous iteration to the current one. This reduces oscillations and speeds up convergence in certain directions.

3. Adagrad: Adagrad adapts the learning rate for each parameter individually based on their historical gradients. It works well when dealing with sparse data but tends to decrease the learning rate too aggressively over time.

4. RMSprop: RMSprop is similar to Adagrad but uses an exponentially decaying average of past squared gradients instead of the sum. This prevents the learning rate from decreasing too quickly.

5. Adam: Adam combines ideas from both momentum and RMSprop. It maintains separate exponential moving averages for the first and second moments of the gradients, resulting in an adaptive learning rate for each parameter.

These optimization techniques help improve the performance of deep learning models by minimizing the loss function more efficiently. Without explicit mentions in the provided context, it remains unclear which specific technique was employed in this case.
