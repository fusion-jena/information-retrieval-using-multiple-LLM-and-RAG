The given context does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model such as learning rate or optimizer. However, it mentions that there is a hyperparameter called gamma (Î³) which is experimentally chosen and kept constant at 10% for all experiments of IFTL (Intuitionistic Fuzzy Transfer Learning). It seems that this hyperparameter plays a role in controlling hesitancy during transfer learning by considering GRNN (General Regression Neural Network) and SVR (Support Vector Regression) as the TUR (Target Underlying Regressor). Unfortunately, the context does not provide further details regarding other hyperparameters typically used in deep learning models.
