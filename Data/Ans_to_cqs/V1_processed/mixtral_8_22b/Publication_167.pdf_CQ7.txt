The data is split into three sets for deep learning model training: training, validation, and testing sets. The specific percentages used for these sets are 5.4%, 0.6%, and 1%, respectively. The training set is used for model fitting, while the validation set is used to adjust the hyperparameters of the model and conduct a preliminary evaluation of its capabilities. The testing set is used to evaluate the final model's generalization ability but cannot be used for algorithm-related selections like parameter tuning or feature selection. In this case, the training set consists of grids with neighborhood features from six different years (1986, 2005, 2008, 2010, and 2013), including various features such as land use type, soil, topography, elevation, slope, aspect, distances to settlements, roads, and rivers within the grid unit and four neighboring grid units. Additionally, constraint factors are considered, combining statistical data and quantities simulated through the backtracking of the Markov model to determine the number of different land use types in 2000 after being modified by simulation numbers.
