Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. However, it does state that artificial neural networks (ANNs) can be computationally intensive and require substantial amounts of data for proper training. This suggests that high-performance computing resources would likely be necessary to efficiently train such models. Therefore, while not explicitly stated, it is reasonable to infer that hardware resources such as GPUs or TPUs could potentially be utilized for this purpose due to their capacity for accelerating complex computations.
