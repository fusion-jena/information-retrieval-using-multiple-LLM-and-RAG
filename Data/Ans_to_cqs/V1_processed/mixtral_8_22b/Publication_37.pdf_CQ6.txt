Based on the given context, it appears that the authors have not explicitly mentioned any specific preprocessing steps taken before training their deep learning model. However, they do mention some important aspects related to the training process such as optimization of cross-entropy loss via mini-batch stochastic gradient descent, application of dropout to the input of the last two layers, and L2 regularization applied to the weights of the last two layers. They also specify the use of a validation set to determine the best performing model parameters. While these details provide valuable information about the training process, they do not directly address the preprocessing steps typically performed prior to training a deep learning model. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, we cannot definitively answer what preprocessing steps were involved before training the deep learning model.
