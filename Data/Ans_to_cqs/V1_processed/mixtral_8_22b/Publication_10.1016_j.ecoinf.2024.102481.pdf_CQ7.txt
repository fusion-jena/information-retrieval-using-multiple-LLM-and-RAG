In machine learning, including deep learning, datasets are typically divided into three subsets: training set, validation set, and testing set. Each subset serves a specific purpose during the model building and evaluation process.

1. Training Set: This is the largest portion of the dataset, usually around 60-80%. It is used to train the model, meaning it helps the model learn patterns and relationships within the data. During training, the model adjusts its parameters based on the errors it makes while trying to predict the target variable.

2. Validation Set: Also known as the development or holdout set, this subset comprises about 10-20% of the total dataset. Its primary function is to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model performs well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data because it has learned the noise and outliers instead of generalizing the underlying pattern. By evaluating the model's performance on the validation set after each epoch (complete pass through the training data), we can identify the optimal number of iterations before the model starts to overfit.

3. Testing Set: This subset represents approximately 10-20% of the entire dataset. Once the final model has been trained using the training set and validated using the validation set, it is evaluated on the testing set. This step provides an unbiased estimate of how well the model will perform on completely new, unseen data. Since the testing set remains entirely separate throughout the training and validation processes, it offers a reliable measure of the model's ability to generalize.

These proportions are not fixed and can vary depending on the size and nature of the dataset. However, maintaining a balance between the three sets ensures that the model is robust, accurate, and capable of handling real-world scenarios effectively.
