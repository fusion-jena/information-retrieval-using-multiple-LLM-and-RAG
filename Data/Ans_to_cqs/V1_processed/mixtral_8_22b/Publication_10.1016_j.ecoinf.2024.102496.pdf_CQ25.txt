The discussion does not provide explicit information about the purpose of any deep learning models used in the development of the equitable nutrient reduction decision support tool. However, it mentions that the tool has various features such as zoom in/out, search bar, environmental justice indices, map legend, filtering metrics, online data addition, basemap selection, and sharing options. It also highlights that users can access pollutant loads before and after Best Management Practices (BMP) implementation using a drop-down menu. Based on these features, one could infer that if a deep learning model were employed, it might be used for tasks like image recognition, pattern analysis, or predictive modeling related to environmental justice indices, pollutant loads, or BMP effectiveness. Nevertheless, without more specific details regarding the use of deep learning models in the tool, we cannot definitively state their purpose.
