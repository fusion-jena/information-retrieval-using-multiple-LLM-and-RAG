In the given context, it is mentioned that the system uses Mask R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) as its deep learning model. Mask R-CNN is built upon Faster R-CNN and adds a branch for predicting object masks in parallel with the existing branch for bounding box recognition. It utilizes a two-stage process involving region proposal networks (RPN) and a detection network. Therefore, Mask R-CNN can be considered a variant of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) specifically designed for object detection and instance segmentation tasks.
