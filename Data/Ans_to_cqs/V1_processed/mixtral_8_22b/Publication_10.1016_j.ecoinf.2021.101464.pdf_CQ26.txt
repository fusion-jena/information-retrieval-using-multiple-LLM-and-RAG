Based on the given context, there isn't any direct mention of specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, some general principles related to handling data bias can still be observed.

One technique mentioned is using the same subset data for applying Random Forests (RF) to ensure a similar process between two methods. This approach helps maintain consistency and avoid potential biases introduced by using different subsets of data.

Additionally, the context discusses determining the optimal number of variables (M) using the internal RF function TuneRF, which calculates the optimal number of variables with the minimum Out-Of-Bag (OOB) error rate. By minimizing the OOB error rate, this method aims to reduce the impact of noise or irrelevant features in the dataset, thus addressing potential sources of bias.

Furthermore, the text suggests increasing the observation index, extending the observation time, and strengthening the joint observation of multi-regions and multi-tree species. These recommendations imply collecting more comprehensive and diverse datasets, which can help mitigate biases caused by limited or skewed data representation.

Lastly, the context mentions applying big data theory, neural networks, structural equations, and other deep-level data mining methods to understand the importance level of climate differences on selected variables and the overall prediction ability of relevant models. While not explicitly stated, these advanced analytical techniques may also contribute to identifying and reducing biases within the data.
