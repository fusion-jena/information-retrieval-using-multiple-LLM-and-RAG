After the model training, there are several postprocessing steps involved. One such step is calculating metrics to evaluate the performance of the trained model. These metrics can include overall accuracy, producer's accuracy, user's accuracy, and total accuracy. Another important postprocessing step is creating a confusion matrix, which provides a summary of the predictions made by the classifier compared to the actual values. It shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions broken down by each category. Additionally, saliency maps can be created to visualize the importance of different features in making predictions. However, the specific postprocessing steps may vary depending on the type of machine learning task and the requirements of the project.

In the given context, the authors mention conducting an additional accuracy assessment using validation points to estimate the ability of the DNN algorithm to map burned areas in the study area. They also provide a confusion matrix between reference (sample points) and estimated burned area (MODIS Burned Area MCD64A1) to compare the predicted results with the actual values. Therefore, we can infer that the postprocessing steps involved in this study included calculating metrics such as overall accuracy, producer's accuracy, user's accuracy, and total accuracy, as well as generating a confusion matrix.
