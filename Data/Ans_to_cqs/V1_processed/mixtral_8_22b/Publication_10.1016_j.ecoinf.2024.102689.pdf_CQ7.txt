The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it mentions that the dataset was partitioned into ten equal sections, or folds, for conducting rigorous folded cross-validation. This methodology involves a cyclical process of training and testing, where one fold serves as the test set while the remaining nine folds are used for training. The trained model is then evaluated on the test set, and the resulting performance metrics are recorded. By averaging these outcomes, a comprehensive assessment of the modelâ€™s performance can be obtained. It can be inferred that the dataset was divided randomly into ten equal parts for this purpose.

In general, when splitting datasets for deep learning models, common practices include dividing the data into three sets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to fit the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final model's performance. The most commonly used ratios for splitting the data are 60/20/20 or 70/15/15 for training, validation, and testing respectively. However, the exact ratio may vary depending on the size of the dataset and the requirements of the project.
