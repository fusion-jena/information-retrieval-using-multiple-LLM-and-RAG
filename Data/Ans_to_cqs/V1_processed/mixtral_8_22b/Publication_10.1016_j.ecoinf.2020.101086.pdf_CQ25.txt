Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of a deep learning model being used. However, the text discusses Species Distribution Models (SDMs) and their limitations due to factors like scarce species occurrences and insufficient species records. These models seem to focus on predicting suitable habitats for specific species based on various environmental features.

In this case, the purpose of these models appears to be spatial prediction rather than traditional deep learning tasks like image classification, object detection, or semantic segmentation. Nevertheless, deep learning techniques could potentially be applied to improve SDMs by incorporating more complex relationships between environmental variables and species distributions.
