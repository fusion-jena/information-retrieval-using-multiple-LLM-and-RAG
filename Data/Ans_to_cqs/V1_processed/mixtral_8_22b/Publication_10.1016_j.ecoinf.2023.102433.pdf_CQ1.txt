The given context does not explicitly mention the term 'deep learning', but it discusses the collection of remote sensing data, which can be used in various applications including deep learning models. The method described involves utilizing a DataHarvester class within the domain of Remote Sensing. This component consists of synchronous or asynchronous processes capable of detecting new satellite images from a space agency's database. Once detected, the component downloads the data using internal scripts.

Different implementations of the DataHarvester class can target other databases, ensuring flexibility of use for diverse user requirements. Users may choose among various open-source NoSQL frameworks such as HBase, Elasticsearch, or traditional SQL database solutions. Regardless of the chosen storage solution, the stored MODIS data supports multiple data types.

Furthermore, the context mentions several Python solutions designed for acquiring and ingesting remote sensing data. These include USGS's Inventory Service API, landsatxplore package, and Sentinelsat package. These tools provide functionalities like searching, downloading, and retrieving metadata of satellite images from sources like the ESA Copernicus Open Access Hub.

However, the context does not directly address the specific methods employed for gathering raw data through means such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. Instead, it focuses primarily on obtaining remote sensing data via satellite imagery and related technologies.
