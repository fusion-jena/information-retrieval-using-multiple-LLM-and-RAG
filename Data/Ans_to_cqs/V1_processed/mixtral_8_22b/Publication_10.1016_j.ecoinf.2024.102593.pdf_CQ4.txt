The provided context does not explicitly mention specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, scaling, or others used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses various aspects related to deep learning, including transfer learning using embeddings, active learning, and analysis of embeddings. These concepts are crucial in improving model performance, especially when dealing with limited labeled data or focusing on specific classes like rare bird species. Unfortunately, without more detailed information about the specific deep learning pipelines employed, I cannot provide a precise list of data augmentation techniques used.
