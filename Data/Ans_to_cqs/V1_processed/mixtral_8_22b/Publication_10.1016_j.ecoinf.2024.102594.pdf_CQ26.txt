The text does not provide explicit details on specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it mentions some methods employed during the training process of the DeepLabV3+ model, which could potentially help mitigate data bias. These include:

1. Data Augmentation: This technique involves creating new samples from existing ones by applying transformations like flipping, exchanging between multiple image channels, random rotation, and adding noise. This can help increase the diversity of the dataset and reduce overfitting.

2. Sample Size Maximization: By cutting all remote sensing images and semantic labels of land cover classes into a series of regular image blocks, the authors aimed to maximize the sample size. This approach might indirectly contribute to reducing data bias by ensuring a larger and more representative dataset.

3. Consistent Cropping Approach: Maintaining consistency with the cropping approach in the model prediction stage during the preprocessing phase could also aid in preventing potential biases introduced by inconsistencies in data preparation.
