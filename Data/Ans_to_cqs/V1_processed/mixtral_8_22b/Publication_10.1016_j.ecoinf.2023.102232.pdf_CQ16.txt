Based on the provided context, it appears that the training process involves two main steps: the Least Squares (LS) algorithm and the Genetic Algorithm (GA). However, the context does not explicitly mention specific criteria for determining when the training is complete. Nevertheless, some insights can be derived from the description of the process.

In the case of the LS algorithm, it seems that the criterion for completion might be related to ordering the entries of the database from smaller to higher sums of residual values. This could imply that the training stops once the optimal solution or set of solutions has been found, which minimizes the sum of residuals.

Regarding the GA, the completion criterion might be linked to the number of cycles performed by the genetic algorithm, denoted as nGAC. In this particular scenario, the text mentions that they considered a nGAC equal to 2. Therefore, it can be inferred that the training completes after executing the GA for a predetermined number of cycles.

However, without further information about the specific implementation details or performance metrics, such as validation loss plateaus or other stopping conditions commonly employed in machine learning algorithms, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer regarding the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete.
