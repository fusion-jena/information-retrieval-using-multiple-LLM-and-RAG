The given context does not provide specific information about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some commonly used techniques to address data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting is a technique where the dataset is divided into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes or labels in both sets. This ensures that the classifier learns from a representative sample of each class.

Oversampling is a method used when there is a significant imbalance in the number of samples belonging to different classes. Oversampling increases the number of minority class examples by duplicating them or creating synthetic examples using interpolation techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).

Undersampling is another approach to dealing with class imbalance, but instead of increasing the size of the minority class, it reduces the size of the majority class. Random undersampling removes random instances from the majority class until the desired balance is achieved. More sophisticated approaches like NearMiss use distance measures to selectively remove majority class instances close to the minority class boundary.

Diverse data collection aims to gather a wide range of data points representing various scenarios, conditions, and populations. By collecting diverse data, the model can better generalize and perform well across different situations.

These techniques help mitigate data bias and improve the overall performance of deep learning models.
