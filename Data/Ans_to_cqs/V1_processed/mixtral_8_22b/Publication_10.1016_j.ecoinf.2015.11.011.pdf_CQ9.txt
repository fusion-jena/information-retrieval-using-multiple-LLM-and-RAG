The article does not provide information on where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The authors mention using various tools such as ArcGIS, ENVI, eCognition, and Leica Photogrammetry Suite for processing their data, but they do not specify where this processed data or any code used in their analysis can be accessed by readers. Therefore, it is unclear if the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is publicly accessible through platforms like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
