The given context does not provide explicit details about the deployment process of the trained deep learning models (CNN and k-NN). However, based on common practices in machine learning projects, we can infer some possibilities.

Model Serialization: To save and store the trained models, they would likely need to be serialized into a format such as JSON or pickle files. This allows them to be saved locally and loaded back into memory later for prediction tasks.

Platform Selection: Depending on the intended application, the platform for deploying these models could vary. They might be deployed on cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure, which offer services for hosting machine learning models. Alternatively, if the goal is to create a standalone desktop application, frameworks like TensorFlow Serving or Flask could be used to serve the models.

Retraining: As mentioned in the context, there is a script called '3_update_network.py', which suggests that the models are designed to be retrained periodically with newly classified data. This implies that the deployment setup should also include provisions for updating the models with freshly trained versions.

However, without specific details from the given context, these assumptions remain speculative. It is recommended to refer to any other available documentation or resources related to this project for more accurate information regarding the deployment process.
