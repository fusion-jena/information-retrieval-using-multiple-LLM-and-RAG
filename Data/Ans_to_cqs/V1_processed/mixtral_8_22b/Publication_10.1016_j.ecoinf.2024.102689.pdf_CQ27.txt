The text does not provide specific information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, it mentions that the programming language used is Python 3.6, along with PyTorch version 1.8.0 within the Anaconda3 virtual environment. This suggests that the model could be deployed using these tools or similar ones compatible with them. Additionally, the use of GPU and CUDA version 11.4 implies that the deployment platform should also support GPU acceleration for optimal performance. Unfortunately, without further details, it is impossible to determine the exact steps taken for model deployment.
