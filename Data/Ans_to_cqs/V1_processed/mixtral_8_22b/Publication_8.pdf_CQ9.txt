The article does not explicitly mention where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it is common practice to provide links to data repositories in research articles when they are used. Since this paper was published in the Biodiversity Data Journal, which encourages open access and sharing of data, it is likely that the authors have made their data publicly available. The most probable platforms for hosting such data would be Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF, given their popularity and relevance to biodiversity studies. To find out exactly where the data repository is located, one could contact the corresponding author, Sohaib Younis, via email (sohaibyounis89@gmail.com) or check the supplementary materials section of the article if available.
