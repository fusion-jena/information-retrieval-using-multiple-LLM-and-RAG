The provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, including details about model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a specific answer based solely on the given information. However, generally speaking, after training a deep learning model, one might save the model using techniques such as model checkpointing or serializing the model weights into a file format compatible with the chosen deployment environment. As for platform selection, factors such as hardware requirements, scalability needs, latency considerations, and integration with existing systems would influence the choice of deployment platforms, which could range from cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure to edge devices or custom servers.
