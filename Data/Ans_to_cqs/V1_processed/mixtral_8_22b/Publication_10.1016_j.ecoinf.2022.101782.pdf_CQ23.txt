Based on the provided context, there isn't explicit mention of specific techniques like diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting being employed to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, some aspects mentioned could contribute towards achieving this goal indirectly. For instance, the model was trained on a substantial dataset consisting of 24,675 images and tested on an independent test set of 2060 images. Additionally, image augmentation techniques such as horizontal flips, shearing, and random zooms were applied during training, potentially increasing the diversity of the input data. Furthermore, the model was optimized using the ADAM optimizer with a learning rate of 10, which might have helped improve its performance across varying inputs. Nevertheless, without direct evidence of employing specific techniques aimed at enhancing generalizability, it cannot be definitively stated how the researchers ensured their deep learning model would perform well on new, unseen data.
