Unfortunately, there isn't any explicit mention of specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline in the provided context. However, generally speaking, several common techniques can be employed to mitigate data bias issues. These include stratified sampling, where the dataset is divided into subgroups or strata, ensuring equal representation from all groups when creating training and test datasets. Oversampling involves increasing the frequency of underrepresented classes in the dataset, while undersampling reduces the frequency of overrepresented classes. Another approach is diverse data collection, which aims to gather more representative samples across different categories, reducing potential biases caused by limited or skewed data sources.
