The given context does not provide specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, generally speaking, some common data annotation techniques used in deep learning include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and labeling. Bounding box annotation involves drawing a rectangle around objects of interest within images or videos. Semantic segmentation is the process of classifying each pixel in an image into different categories. Instance segmentation is similar to semantic segmentation but also identifies individual instances of objects within an image. Polygon annotation involves outlining complex shapes using vertices and edges. Key point annotation involves marking specific points on objects within images or videos. Labeling involves assigning labels to entire images or regions within them. These techniques can be applied manually by humans or automated through machine learning algorithms.
