The authors do not explicitly mention any specific metric used to evaluate the performance of their deep learning model. However, they compare the denoising results of their proposed method with other bioacoustics noise reduction algorithms such as SEGAN, WebRTC, wavelet transform, Wiener filter, and MMSE STSA algorithms. They also discuss the differences in performance between these methods, which suggests that some form of quantitative comparison has been made. Additionally, they mention that the deep learning model is larger in size and demands more computational resources, implying that perhaps efficiency or resource usage could have been considered when evaluating its performance. Nevertheless, without explicit information about the exact metrics used, I cannot provide a definitive list of the metrics employed by the authors to assess the performance of their deep learning model.
