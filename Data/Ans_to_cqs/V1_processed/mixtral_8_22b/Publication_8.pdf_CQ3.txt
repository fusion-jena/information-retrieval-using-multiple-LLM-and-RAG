In the given context, there isn't explicit mention of specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer that bounding box annotations were employed based on the usage of Faster R-CNN (Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network) for object detection tasks.

Bounding boxes are rectangular annotations drawn around objects within an image, providing essential location and spatial information about each object. In this case, they were likely utilized to identify and locate various plant organs present in the digitized herbarium scans.

Instance segmentation, on the other hand, involves creating pixel-wise masks for individual instances of objects within an image. While not explicitly mentioned in the text, it could potentially be applied alongside bounding box annotations to further refine the identification and delineation of plant organ boundaries.

To summarize, although the exact data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline remains undisclosed, it is evident that bounding box annotations played a significant role in identifying and locating plant organs in the digitized herbarium scans. Instance segmentation may also have been incorporated to enhance the accuracy of plant organ boundary recognition.
