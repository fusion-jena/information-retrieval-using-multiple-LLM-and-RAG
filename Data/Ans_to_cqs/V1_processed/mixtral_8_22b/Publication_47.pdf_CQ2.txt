The text does not provide explicit information about the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the predictions were based on four groups of features derived from digitally available occurrence records. These features include geographical, climatic, biome, and anthropogenic factors. This suggests that the input data might be structured data, possibly in a tabular format like CSV, containing various attributes related to these factors. But without more specific information, it is impossible to definitively state the exact data format used in this case.
