Based on the information provided, there is no mention of any specific deep learning framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch being used to build the models. Instead, it appears that Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT) models were employed using manual hyperparameter tuning. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the use of TensorFlow or PyTorch in building these models.
