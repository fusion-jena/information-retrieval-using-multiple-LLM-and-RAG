Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the study focuses on dealing with regression problems and uses Bayesian Deep Learning models. It also states that these models can return satisfactory results even with limited datasets, suggesting that the dataset used might not be extensive. Additionally, the context discusses the application of deep learning techniques in agriculture, indicating that the dataset could potentially involve agricultural data such as crop growth patterns, weather conditions, soil quality, etc. But without explicit mention of the dataset names, it cannot be confirmed.
