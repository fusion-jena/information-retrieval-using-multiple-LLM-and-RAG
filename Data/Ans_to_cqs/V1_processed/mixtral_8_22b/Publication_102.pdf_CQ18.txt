To monitor the model performance during training, the authors employed several strategies. Firstly, they utilized a validation set to evaluate the model's performance after each epoch. By comparing the results obtained from this validation set, they could determine whether the model was improving or not. Secondly, they implemented the early stopping technique to prevent overfitting. Early stopping involves halting the training process once the model's performance on the validation set stops improving. In this study, the authors applied early stopping based on the model's performance on the validation set. Lastly, they visualized the training loss curve, which plots the training loss function gradient versus the iteration number. This graph helped them observe how the model's performance changed throughout the training process.
