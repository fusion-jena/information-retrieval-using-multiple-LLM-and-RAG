The text does not provide explicit information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions that no hyperparameter tuning was conducted and all models were executed with default FIT parameters on the full dataset. This suggests that the researchers might have relied on standard evaluation metrics or techniques to assess the model performance during training without explicitly mentioning them in the given context.
