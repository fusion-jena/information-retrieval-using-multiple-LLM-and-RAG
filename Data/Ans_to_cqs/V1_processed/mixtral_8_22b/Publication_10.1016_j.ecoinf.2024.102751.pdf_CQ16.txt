There isn't specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete in the given context. However, some common criteria used to determine when training is complete include:

* Validation Loss Plateau: When the validation loss stops decreasing significantly with each epoch, this may indicate that further training would not result in significant improvements.
* Early Stopping: Training is stopped early if the performance on a validation set does not improve after a certain number of iterations.
* Maximum Number of Iterations: Training can also stop once a maximum number of iterations have been reached.
* Learning Rate Schedule: Some models use a learning rate schedule where the learning rate is reduced over time. Once the learning rate reaches a minimum threshold, training can be considered complete.
