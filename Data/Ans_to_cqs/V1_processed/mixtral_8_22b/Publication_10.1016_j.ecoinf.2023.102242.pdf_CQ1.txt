Based on the given context, it does not provide specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. However, it mentions the use of high-resolution remote sensing data, which could potentially be collected through various means like satellite imagery, drones, or airborne sensors. It also discusses the challenges faced during the processing of this data due to its large volume and complexity. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of having representative and adequate training samples for classification tasks, but it doesn't explicitly mention how these samples are gathered. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, we cannot definitively state what methods are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
