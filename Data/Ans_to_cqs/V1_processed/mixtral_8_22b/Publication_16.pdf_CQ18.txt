The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves tracking the loss of the model using both the test and validation data. This is illustrated in Figure 9, which shows that there was no overfitting during training and that the dropout layers helped with model regularization. Additionally, the model convergence was achieved early in the training session but the loss continued to decrease throughout the specified epochs. Furthermore, the accuracy for both the train and validation data was monitored over 100 epochs, as shown in Figure 10. These strategies allowed for the observation of the model's performance and ensured that the necessary number of epochs required for model convergence was sufficient.
