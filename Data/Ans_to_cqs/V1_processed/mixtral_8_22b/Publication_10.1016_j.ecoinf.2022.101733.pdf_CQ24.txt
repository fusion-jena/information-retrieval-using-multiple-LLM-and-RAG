The literature does not provide specific strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline related to the random seed value. However, it mentions that there are two main approaches for collecting samples: point-wise and polygon-based. These sampling strategies do not directly address handling randomness but rather focus on improving the quality and diversity of the dataset.

For instance, in the case of citrus and non-citrus classification, random samples are generated within the study area, constrained by EGI and WCNV shapefiles. These samples are then divided into two categories: 'citrus' and 'non-citrus'. After the initial automatic selection, a human operator verifies the chosen samples using Google Earth's images, ensuring their appropriateness. Additionally, manual samples are gathered based on the Google Earth Engine satellite view to enhance the robustness and confidence of the sample selection process.

Furthermore, the literature discusses various machine learning techniques applied in ecological informatics, such as Random Forest and Decision Trees, to estimate the behavior of migratory bees or determine the onset of grass aging. However, none of these studies specifically addresses managing randomness in the deep learning pipeline concerning the random seed value.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it appears that the primary focus lies in enhancing data collection and processing methods rather than addressing randomness in the deep learning pipeline due to random seed values.
