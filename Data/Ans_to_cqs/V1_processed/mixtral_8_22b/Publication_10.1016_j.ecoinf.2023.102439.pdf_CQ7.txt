In this case, the data was divided into two sets: one for training and another for testing and validation purposes. The training set consisted of data from 2005 to 2015, comprising 264 data points, which accounted for 60% of the total dataset. On the other hand, the remaining 40% of the data, consisting of 72 data points collected from 2016 to 2018, was allocated for testing and validation. This division allowed the researchers to assess the model's ability to generalize its learned patterns to unseen data accurately.
