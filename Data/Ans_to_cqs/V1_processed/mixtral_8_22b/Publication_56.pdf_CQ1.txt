The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that remote sensing data is being collected through various means such as satellite images, drones, or other airborne platforms. Additionally, some papers mentioned in the references discuss the use of hyperspectral data, which could imply the use of specialized sensors capable of capturing detailed spectral information. Publicly available datasets like Sentinel-2 time series may also be employed. Nevertheless, without more precise details, it cannot be definitively stated what exact methods are being utilized for gathering raw data in this particular case.
