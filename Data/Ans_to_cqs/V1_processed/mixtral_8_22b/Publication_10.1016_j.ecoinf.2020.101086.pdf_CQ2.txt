Based on the provided context, it appears that the data format used in this case is related to pixels within an environmental space. Specifically, the text mentions representing pixels in an environmental variable space through methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), or Factor Analysis of Mixed Data (FAMD). These methods suggest that the input data might be in a tabular format, possibly a CSV file containing numerical and categorical environmental variables. However, without explicit mention of the specific data format used for input into the deep learning pipeline, we cannot definitively state whether the data is in the form of images, audio, video, or another format.
