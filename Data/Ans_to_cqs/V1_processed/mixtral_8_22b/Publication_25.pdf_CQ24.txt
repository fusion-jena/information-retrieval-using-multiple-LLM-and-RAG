The provided context does not directly address the specific issue of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing the impact of different random seed values. However, it discusses some strategies related to improving deep learning performance in natural systems despite limitations like insufficient or low-quality training data. These include self-supervised learning, where unsupervised methods are used to generate training data, and semi-supervised learning, combining both labeled and unlabeled data. Additionally, pretraining a neural network using unsupervised detection to generate trees is mentioned. Nevertheless, these techniques do not specifically target the issue of managing randomness within the deep learning process itself.
