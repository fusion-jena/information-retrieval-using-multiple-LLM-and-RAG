The given context does not provide information about specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it mentions that the dataset consists of water quality parameters (WQP) including conductivity, BOD, nitrate, and DO. It also states that the dataset is divided into five equal-sized folds using fivefold cross-validation for model evaluation and hyperparameter selection. Therefore, we can infer that the dataset used in this case is related to water quality parameters and not any of the common deep learning datasets mentioned in the query.
