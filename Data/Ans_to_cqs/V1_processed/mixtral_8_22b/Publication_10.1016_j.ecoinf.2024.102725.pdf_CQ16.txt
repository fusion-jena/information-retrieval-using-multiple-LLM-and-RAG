Based on the given information, there isn't any direct mention of specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau or other stopping conditions. However, we can infer that the study uses various evaluation metrics like the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and error relative global accuracy (ERGAS) to compare the differences between the predicted and actual images. These metrics help evaluate the performance of the models during training and could potentially be used to decide when to stop training based on their improvement over time. Nonetheless, without explicit details about the training process, it remains uncertain which exact criteria are applied to conclude the completion of training.
