The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is implied that images were used as inputs for the models mentioned. For instance, the text mentions setting up the model configuration file with an image size of 1536 x 1536, which suggests that the input data consists of images. Additionally, references to various computer vision conferences and papers indicate that the focus is primarily on visual data. Therefore, while other data formats such as audio or video may be compatible with some of the mentioned models, the context provided here pertains mainly to image data.
