The given context does not provide information about the specific data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. However, some common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, shearing, and adding noise. These techniques help increase the size and diversity of training datasets, which can improve model performance and prevent overfitting. It is important to note that the choice of data augmentation technique depends on the nature of the dataset and the problem being solved. For instance, image classification tasks may benefit from rotation or flipping, while natural language processing tasks might require text padding or tokenization. In summary, without additional context, it is impossible to determine which data augmentation techniques were applied in this case.
