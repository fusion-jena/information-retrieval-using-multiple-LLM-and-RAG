Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be involved depending on the specific requirements of the task and the nature of the dataset. However, based on the given context, only one preprocessing step is explicitly mentioned - image augmentation. This involves applying transformations such as random horizontal flipping, random rotation, and random changes in brightness to the input images. These transformations help increase the diversity of the training data and improve the robustness of the model. Other common preprocessing steps not mentioned in the context include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization scales pixel values to a certain range, typically between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1, which helps stabilize the learning process. Scaling resizes the images to fit the input size required by the model architecture. Cleaning removes any irrelevant or corrupted data points from the dataset.
