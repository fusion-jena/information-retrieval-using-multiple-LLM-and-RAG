The text does not directly discuss deep learning pipelines, but it does mention some techniques used in machine learning that could potentially help address data bias during preprocessing. These include dividing the full dataset into three parts: a training set, a validation set, and a test set. This approach is commonly used when data are abundant.

However, when data availability is limited, resampling methods are used instead. One such method mentioned is Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV), where the sample size is equal to k. This method is known to provide nearly unbiased estimations, although it has a heavy computational burden. Therefore, k is conventionally set to five or ten, in which case bias is no longer negligible but can be parametrically corrected.

Stratified sampling is another technique discussed in the text. It involves dividing the study area into strata and then selecting samples within these strata. This method was used to produce a moderately clustered sample.

While the text does not explicitly mention oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, these are common techniques used in machine learning to address class imbalance and improve model performance. Oversampling involves duplicating examples from the minority class, while undersampling involves removing examples from the majority class. Diverse data collection involves collecting more varied data to better represent the population.
