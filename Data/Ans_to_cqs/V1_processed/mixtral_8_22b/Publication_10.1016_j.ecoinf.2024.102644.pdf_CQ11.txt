Based on the given context, it appears that the authors have utilized data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) repository for their study. The GBIF repository is mentioned as a taxonomic and observation data provider involved in several data FAIRness initiatives. Unlike other data providers, GBIF has a broad scope across taxonomic orders and kingdoms, hosting approximately 2.5 billion observation data records globally. Additionally, there is mention of an R package available to automate retrieval of occurrence records containing taxonomic, coordinate, sighting authorship, and primary source information. However, the specific link to the dataset or the deep learning pipeline within the GBIF repository is not explicitly stated in the provided context. Therefore, I am unable to provide the exact link to the deep learning pipeline or the dataset within the GBIF repository. To find this information, one would need to search for the relevant datasets or pipelines within the GBIF repository itself.
