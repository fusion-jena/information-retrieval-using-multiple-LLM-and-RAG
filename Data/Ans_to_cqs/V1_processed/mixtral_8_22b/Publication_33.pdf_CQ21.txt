After the initial model training phase, there are several postprocessing steps involved in the methodology described. These include:

1. Tuning Risk Threshold: A risk threshold τi specific to each class (i.e., each species) is determined using a separate and independent database called T1. This helps in setting a confidence threshold for each class.

2. Classification Transformation: The traditional binary classification (correct or incorrect) is transformed into three categories - correct, misclassified, and unsure. This transformation aims to convert as many misclassifications as possible into 'unsure', while minimizing the conversion of correctly classified instances into 'unsure'.

3. Optimal Threshold Selection: The next step involves selecting optimal thresholds {τi}i=n for each class based on the user's goal. This goal is a balance between the accuracy of the result and the proportion of images fully processed.

These postprocessing steps help improve the overall performance of the model and provide more accurate and reliable results. However, it should be noted that these steps might vary depending on the specific application and requirements of the project.
