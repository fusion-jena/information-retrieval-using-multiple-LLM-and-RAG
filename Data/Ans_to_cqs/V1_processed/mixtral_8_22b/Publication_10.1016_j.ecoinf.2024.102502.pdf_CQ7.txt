Based on the given context, there is no explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, or validation sets. However, generally speaking, common practices include splitting the dataset randomly or based on chronology. For instance, if dealing with time series data, one might use earlier data for training and later data for testing and validation. Another method could involve using a certain percentage of the total data for training, another portion for validation, and the remaining part for testing. It is essential to ensure that the distribution of classes or labels remains consistent across all subsets to prevent any bias towards a particular class during the training process.
