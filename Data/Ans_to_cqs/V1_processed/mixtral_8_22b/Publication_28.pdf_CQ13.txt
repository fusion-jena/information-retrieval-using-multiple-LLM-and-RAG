The paper does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the hyperparameters of the EfficientNet model are optimized using the IKHO algorithm. Typically, common hyperparameters in deep learning models include learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, optimizer type, etc. In this case, we cannot provide the exact values or types of these hyperparameters since they are not mentioned in the given context.
