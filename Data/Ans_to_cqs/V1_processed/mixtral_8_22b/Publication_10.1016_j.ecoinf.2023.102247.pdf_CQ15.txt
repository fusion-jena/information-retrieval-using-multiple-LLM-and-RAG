Based on the given context, it appears that the authors have utilized ensemble modeling in their research. They employed the BIOMOD2 package in R to predict the distribution of the study species. This approach involves combining multiple models to create a single prediction model. In this case, they used four different models: Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). These models were then weighted and averaged to produce a final ensembled model for each species.

To evaluate the performance of these models, the authors used cross-validation by dividing the dataset into 70% training data and 30% testing data. The Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) was used as the metric to measure the accuracy of the models. A higher AUC value indicates better model performance.

However, based on the provided information, there is no mention of specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) being applied in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful response regarding which optimization techniques were used in the deep learning pipeline.
