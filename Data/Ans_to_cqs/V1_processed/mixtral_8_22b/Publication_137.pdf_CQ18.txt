The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves setting the learning decay rate to 0.7. This allows the learning rate to gradually decay as the training progresses. Additionally, the authors use overall accuracy (OA) as a metric to evaluate the performance of their model. They also adjust various parameters such as voxel size, regularization strength, and batch size to optimize the model's performance. Furthermore, they employ the hold-out method to separate the test set and training set at a ratio of 3:7 for preprocessing the original data. By doing this, they are able to fine-tune the parameters of the network and investigate the influence of these parameters on the experimental results.
