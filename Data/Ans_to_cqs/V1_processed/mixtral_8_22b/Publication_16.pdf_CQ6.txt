Based on the given context, it appears that the authors utilized the Librosa library for data pre-processing. However, the specific preprocessing steps involved before training their deep learning model are not explicitly mentioned. Generally speaking, common preprocessing steps for audio data may include normalization, scaling, noise reduction or removal, and feature extraction techniques such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC). In this case, the authors do mention using MFCC for feature extraction from the audio samples. Additionally, they discuss segmenting the audio files into 15-second windows, which could be considered another form of preprocessing.
