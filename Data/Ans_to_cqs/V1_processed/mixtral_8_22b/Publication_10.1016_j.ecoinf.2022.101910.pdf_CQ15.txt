The given context does not provide information about specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). It primarily focuses on describing the use of BirdNET, a deep learning approach for detecting and classifying bird vocalizations, and its application in various studies. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which optimization techniques were utilized based solely on this context.
