Unfortunately, based on the given context, there isn't enough information to provide a specific criterion used to determine when training is complete. However, common criteria include reaching a certain number of epochs, achieving a desired level of accuracy or loss on the validation set, or observing a plateau in the validation loss. These criteria help ensure that the model has learned from the training data without overfitting.

Based on the results section, it appears that the model performed exceptionally well on both the training and validation datasets, achieving high F1 scores. This suggests that the training process may have been stopped once the model reached satisfactory performance on the validation set. However, without explicit details about the stopping criteria, this remains speculative.
