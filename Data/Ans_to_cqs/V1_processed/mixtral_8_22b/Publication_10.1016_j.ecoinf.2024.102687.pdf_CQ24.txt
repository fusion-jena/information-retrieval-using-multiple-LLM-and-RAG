The provided context does not directly address the handling of randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some strategies commonly used to manage randomness in deep learning pipelines include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, employing techniques like ensemble modeling or cross-validation to reduce variance caused by random initialization, and utilizing deterministic algorithms where possible.
