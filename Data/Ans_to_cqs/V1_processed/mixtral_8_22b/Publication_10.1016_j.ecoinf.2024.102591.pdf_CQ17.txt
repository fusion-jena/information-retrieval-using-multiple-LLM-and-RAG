The text does not mention any specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the Random Forest (RF) regression algorithm is adopted for high computational efficiency in Google Earth Engine (GEE). While the RF algorithm itself does not use traditional regularization techniques like dropout or L2 regularization, it inherently helps prevent overfitting through ensemble learning and random feature selection during tree construction. In this study, the authors preserve the default values for RF hyperparameters but increase the number of trees to 500 to further enhance computational efficiency in GEE.
