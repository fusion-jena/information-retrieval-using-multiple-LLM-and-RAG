The context does not provide specific information about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, generally speaking, common preprocessing steps include data normalization, scaling, cleaning, and augmentation. Normalization is used to rescale values measured on different scales to a standard scale, while scaling involves adjusting all features to have the same range of values. Cleaning refers to removing noise from the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and irrelevant observations. Lastly, data augmentation techniques like rotation, zooming, flipping, cropping, etc., are often applied to increase the size of the dataset artificially. These preprocessing steps help improve the performance and accuracy of the deep learning model.
