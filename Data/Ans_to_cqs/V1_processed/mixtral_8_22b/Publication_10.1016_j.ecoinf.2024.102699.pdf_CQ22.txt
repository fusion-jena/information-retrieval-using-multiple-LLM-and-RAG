Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention any specific evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the deep learning models discussed in the text. Typically, common evaluation metrics for machine learning and computer vision tasks include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves, and area under the curve (AUC), among others. These metrics help quantify the effectiveness of a model in making accurate predictions or classifications based on its learned representations from the given dataset. Without explicit information regarding the evaluation metrics employed in this case, I cannot provide a definitive answer.
