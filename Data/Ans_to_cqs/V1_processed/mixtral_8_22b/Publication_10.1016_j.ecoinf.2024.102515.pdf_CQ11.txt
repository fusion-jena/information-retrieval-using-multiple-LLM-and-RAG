Unfortunately, based on the given context, I am unable to provide the exact data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The context does mention the use of 'Full-archive search endpoint' to access the entire dataset published on Twitter, but it does not specify where this data is stored or shared. It also mentions the use of the twarc2 library for handling the data returned by the Twitter API, but again, no specific data repository link is mentioned. Therefore, without additional context, I do not know the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline.
