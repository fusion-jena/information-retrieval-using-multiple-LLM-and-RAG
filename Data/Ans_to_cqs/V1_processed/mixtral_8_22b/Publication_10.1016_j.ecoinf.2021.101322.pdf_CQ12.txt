The study uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as its deep learning model. Specifically, it employs an implementation of EfficientNet--B4, which is a variant of the EfficientNet family of models. These models are designed to achieve high accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. The CNN was implemented using the Keras and TensorFlow software packages in Python, and computations were carried out using CUDA and CuDNN with Nvidia P100 accelerator cards.
