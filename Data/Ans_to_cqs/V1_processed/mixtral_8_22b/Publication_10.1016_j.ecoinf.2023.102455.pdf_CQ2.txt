Based on the given information, there isn't any explicit mention of specific data formats such as images, audio, video, or CSV files being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, we do see that the primary model used is CNN-BiGRU, which suggests that the data might be in a format suitable for processing through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Typically, CNNs are employed for tasks involving grid-like topology data, like time series analysis, image recognition, and natural language processing. Therefore, it could be inferred that the data used in this case might be either time series data or image data. Nonetheless, without further details about the nature of the problem or the dataset, it would not be possible to definitively state what type of data format is being used in the deep learning pipeline.
