The given context does not explicitly mention any specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, there is a reference to using a more advanced optimization approach that combines first-order gradients (loss function gradient) with second-order gradients (loss function curvature). While this description could potentially refer to methods like Newton's method or conjugate gradient descent, without further information, it is difficult to definitively identify the exact optimization techniques being utilized in the deep learning pipeline.
