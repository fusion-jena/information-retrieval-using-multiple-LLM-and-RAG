Training completion is typically determined by monitoring the performance of the model on a separate validation set during training. In this case, the model accuracy was continuously assessed using the validation set during training. The learning curves shown in Figure 6 indicate a reduction in training losses as the number of epochs increases and convergence within 500 epochs. Specifically, Inceptionv3 converged by 400 epochs, while the other networks converged within 150 epochs. Additionally, the ResNet architecture, particularly ResNet50 and ResNet101, outperformed the others. Therefore, it can be concluded that the criteria used to determine when training is complete include observing a decrease in training losses, convergence of the model, and achieving satisfactory performance on the validation set.
