The criterion used to determine when training is complete is called early stopping. This process stops adding further trees, layers, or splits when it no longer improves the validation statistic. For continuous response variables, this includes the R2 value. In the case of the entire machine learning model, early stopping is enabled to prevent overfitting the predicted percentage of CLCuD. Additionally, to address the tendency of neural networks to overfit data, the penalty method is applied within the framework of ANN models.
