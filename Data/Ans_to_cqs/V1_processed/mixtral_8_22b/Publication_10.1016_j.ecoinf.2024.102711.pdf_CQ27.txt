The text does not provide information about the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, common practices include model serialization, where the trained model is saved in a file or database, and platform selection, where a suitable environment is chosen to host the deployed model. This could involve cloud services, local servers, or edge devices depending on the application requirements.
