Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that the machine learning advancements used in this study were partially funded by a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and that a Microsoft Sponsorship supported Azure-based development and model deployment in Whiskerbook.org. However, it does not specify any specific code repository platform like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I do not know where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
