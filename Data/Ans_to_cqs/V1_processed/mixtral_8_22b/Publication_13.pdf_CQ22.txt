The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the curve (AUC). In this case, the main metric used to measure the performance of the model is accuracy. Specifically, the average accuracy reduction is used to compare the performance of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) models. A higher accuracy reduction indicates worse performance on prediction compared to the within-dataset prediction accuracy. Additionally, the study also uses statistical tests to determine if there is a significant difference between the performances of the models.
