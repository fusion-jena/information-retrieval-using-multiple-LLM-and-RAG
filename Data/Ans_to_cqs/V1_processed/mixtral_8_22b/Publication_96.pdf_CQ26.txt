To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes or labels in both sets. This ensures that the model learns from a representative sample of each class, reducing any potential bias towards one particular class.

Oversampling is a technique where samples from the minority class are duplicated to balance the dataset. This helps prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class. However, oversampling may lead to overfitting if not handled carefully.

Undersampling is another method to handle imbalanced datasets, where samples from the majority class are removed to match the number of samples in the minority class. While this reduces the risk of overfitting, it also discards potentially useful information.

Lastly, diverse data collection aims to gather more varied examples of underrepresented classes to improve their representation in the dataset. By collecting additional data, the model can better understand these classes and reduce any inherent bias.

In conclusion, addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline requires careful consideration of various techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Each technique has its advantages and disadvantages, so selecting the appropriate method depends on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the problem at hand.
