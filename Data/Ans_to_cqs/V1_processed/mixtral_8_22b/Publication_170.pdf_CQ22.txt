The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using three metrics: overall error, commission error, and omission error. These metrics are defined by equations (2), (3), and (4) in the paper. Commission error measures the number of false positives divided by the sum of true positives and false positives. Omission error calculates the number of false negatives divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives. However, the specific formulas or values for these metrics are not mentioned in the given context.
