In the given context, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are primarily used as the deep learning model in the pipeline. Specifically, various versions of ResNet such as ResNet101V2, ResNet152V2, and ResNet50 are mentioned along with VGG16. These models are used for tasks like classification and detection of animal vocalizations. The choice of CNNs is likely due to their effectiveness in processing grid-like topology data, such as images or spectrograms, which are commonly used representations of audio signals.
