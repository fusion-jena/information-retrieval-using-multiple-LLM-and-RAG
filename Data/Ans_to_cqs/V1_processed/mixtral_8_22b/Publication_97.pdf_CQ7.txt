In this study, the authors used satellite images for various sites to train their deep learning model. Specifically, they used satellite images for sites #1, #3, #5, #7-10 for training and #2, #4, #6 for validation. They did not mention any specific criteria used to split the data for training and validation sets. However, it can be inferred that the selection of sites for each set was based on the availability and quality of the satellite images. Additionally, the authors mentioned using a stream of almost never repeated sub-images, which suggests that they may have used some form of random sampling or shuffling to generate the training and validation datasets. Overall, while the exact criteria used to split the data were not explicitly stated, it appears that the authors used a combination of site selection and random sampling techniques to create their training and validation datasets.
