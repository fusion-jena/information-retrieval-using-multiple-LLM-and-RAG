Based on the given information, it appears that the authors did not use any specific deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN), or transformers in their ensemble modeling approach. Instead, they utilized various machine learning algorithms like Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) along with a regression-based model. These models were combined using the BIOMOD2 package in R to create ensembles for each species. Therefore, no specific deep learning model was mentioned in the provided context.
