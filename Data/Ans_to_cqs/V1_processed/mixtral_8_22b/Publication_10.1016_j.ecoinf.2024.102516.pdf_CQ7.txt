The context does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to use a random stratified split based on class labels when dealing with supervised learning tasks like classification or semantic segmentation. This ensures that each set has roughly the same distribution of classes. Typically, the dataset is divided into three parts: training set (around 70-80%), validation set (around 10-15%), and test set (around 10-15%). The training set is used to optimize the model parameters, while the validation set helps tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Finally, the test set evaluates the final performance of the fully trained model.
