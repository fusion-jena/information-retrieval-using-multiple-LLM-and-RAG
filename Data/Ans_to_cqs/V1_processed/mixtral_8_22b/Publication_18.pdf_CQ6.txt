The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does discuss some common practices used to improve the performance of deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), including data augmentation and transfer learning. These methods help enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the models without necessarily involving traditional preprocessing steps. Nevertheless, depending on the nature of the input data and the requirements of the specific deep learning task, various preprocessing steps might still be necessary. For instance, image data may require rescaling, normalization, or other forms of transformation to ensure optimal results during training.
