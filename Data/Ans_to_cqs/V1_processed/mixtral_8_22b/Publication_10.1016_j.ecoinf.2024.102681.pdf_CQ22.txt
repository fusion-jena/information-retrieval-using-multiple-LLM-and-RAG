Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the deep learning model. However, one metric mentioned is the improvement in prediction accuracy on the testing set, which increased by approximately 20% when using the hybrid CNN-LSTM model compared to the original CNN model. This suggests that accuracy might be one of the metrics considered for evaluating the model's performance. Other common evaluation metrics for deep learning models include precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, and area under the curve (AUC), among others. These metrics can help measure the effectiveness of the model in handling various aspects of classification tasks, such as correctly identifying positive instances or minimizing false positives and negatives.
