Based on the given context, it appears that a deep learning model has been used to create Species Distribution Models (SDMs) for two seahorse species, Hippocampus guttulatus and Hippocampus hippocampus. These SDMs aim to predict suitable habitats for these species based on various environmental variables. The purpose of this modeling approach seems to be related to wildlife management and conservation efforts, as indicated by keywords such as 'conservation biology', 'ecological corridor', and 'wildlife management'. However, the specific type of deep learning model used (e.g., classification, segmentation, or detection) is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, we cannot definitively determine the exact purpose of the deep learning model beyond its use in creating SDMs for these seahorse species.
