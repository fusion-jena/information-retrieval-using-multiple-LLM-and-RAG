A deep convolutional neural network (CNN) called ResNet-50 is used in the pipeline. This model was originally developed and pre-trained using millions of labeled images across more than 1000 categories. Despite being initially trained for different tasks, it can still extract meaningful features from spectrogram images, which are used as inputs in this case. The activations from the fully connected layer (fc1000) of ResNet-50 serve as feature vectors for each detected signal. These feature vectors are then classified using a one vs. all support vector machine (SVM) classifier.
