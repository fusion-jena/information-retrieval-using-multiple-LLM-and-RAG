In the given context, it is mentioned that the learning rate was set to 1e-3 for all networks except one called ResNet_v2, where it was set to 1e-5. However, there is no explicit mention of the specific optimizer used in the deep learning model. It is also stated that the batch size was set to 128, which means training with 128 images for each iteration. Additionally, the model was trained for 50-60 times using a GPU (Nvidia 1080ti) for approximately two hours and ten minutes.
