Unfortunately, based on the given information, it is not possible to determine which specific frameworks were used to build the deep learning models. The table and text only provide details about the parameters and architectures used for the models but do not mention any specific deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
