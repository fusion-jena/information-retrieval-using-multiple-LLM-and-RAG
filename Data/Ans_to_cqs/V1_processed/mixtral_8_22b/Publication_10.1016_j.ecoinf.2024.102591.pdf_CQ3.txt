The given context does not provide information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based solely on the provided context. However, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. In bounding box annotation, objects within images are identified and labeled with rectangular boxes. Semantic segmentation involves labeling each pixel in an image with its corresponding class, while instance segmentation combines object detection and semantic segmentation to identify individual instances of objects within an image.
