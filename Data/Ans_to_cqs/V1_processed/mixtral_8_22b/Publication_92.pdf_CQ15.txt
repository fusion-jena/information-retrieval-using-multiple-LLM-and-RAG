The text does not provide explicit details about the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the architecture of the network follows GoogleNet's design, which uses a combination of convolutional layers, inception modules, and a softmax classifier. These components are typically trained using gradient descent-based optimization algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or adaptive methods like Adam. Without further information, it cannot be definitively stated which optimization technique was employed in this particular case.
