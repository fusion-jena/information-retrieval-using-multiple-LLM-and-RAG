Regularization methods are techniques used in machine learning models, including deep learning pipelines, to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the noise in the training data instead of the underlying pattern, leading to poor performance on unseen data. Two popular regularization methods mentioned in the context are dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, effectively creating a different architecture for each iteration. This prevents any single neuron from having too much influence and encourages the network to distribute learned features across all neurons. Dropout can be applied to both fully connected layers and convolutional layers.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. By adding this penalty, the optimization algorithm tries to minimize not only the original loss but also the size of the weights. This discourages large weights and promotes smaller ones, making the model more robust against overfitting.

Other regularization methods not explicitly mentioned in the context include L1 regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation. L1 regularization works similarly to L2 regularization but uses the absolute value of the weights instead of squaring them. Early stopping involves monitoring the validation set performance during training and halting the process once it starts degrading. Data augmentation generates new samples by applying transformations like rotation, scaling, or flipping to existing data points, increasing the dataset size and diversity.
