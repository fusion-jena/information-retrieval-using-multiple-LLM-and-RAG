The text does not provide explicit information about how the trained deep learning model was deployed after the training phase. Therefore, I cannot provide specific details regarding the deployment process such as model serialization or platform selection. However, it is mentioned that the experimental setup included a deep learning environment based on Python and TensorFlow - GPU as well as CUDA under the Windows operating system. It can be assumed that the trained model might have been utilized within this environment for further testing and evaluation purposes.
