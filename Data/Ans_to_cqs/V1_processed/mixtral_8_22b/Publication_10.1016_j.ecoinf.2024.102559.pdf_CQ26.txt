The text does not provide explicit information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that due to the invasive nature of iceplant, generating training and test data using traditional sampling methods like random sampling or proportional allocation could lead to a highly unbalanced dataset. Training machine learning models with unbalanced datasets can pose challenges in accurately predicting the minority class, often resulting in underprediction. To overcome this issue, various methods have been proposed in the literature, including those mentioned in the query such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

In this particular scenario, the authors were able to create a reasonably balanced final training dataset without resorting to discarding, repeating, or creating synthetic data points. They achieved this balance by leveraging the high spatial resolution of NAIP and the extensive coverage of their study region, which allowed them to gather sufficient data for both classes. Although the exact methodology employed to achieve this balance is not explicitly stated, one can infer that they might have utilized some form of strategic sampling or weighted distribution of samples between the two classes to ensure better representation of the minority class (iceplant).
