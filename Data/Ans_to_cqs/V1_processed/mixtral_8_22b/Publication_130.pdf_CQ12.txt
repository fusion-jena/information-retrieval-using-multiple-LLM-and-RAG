The text mentions that the authors use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically the VGG19 architecture, for their deep learning tasks. This information can be found in the paragraph discussing the use of deep learning in ecological research, where the authors state, "We used the VGG19 CNN architecture...and initialized the model with the weights of a network pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset." Therefore, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a CNN, specifically the VGG19 architecture.
