Before training a deep learning model, various preprocessing steps are often required to ensure optimal performance. These steps typically involve preparing the input data so that it can be effectively processed by the neural network. Some common preprocessing techniques include:

1. Normalization: This involves rescaling the input features to a standard range, such as between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. Normalization helps prevent any single feature from dominating the others due to differences in scale. It also improves the convergence speed during training.

2. Scaling: Similar to normalization, scaling adjusts the values of input features to fit within a certain range. However, instead of using a standard range, scaling uses a custom range based on the dataset's characteristics. For example, one could use Min-Max scaling to rescale the data between a defined minimum and maximum value.

3. Cleaning: Data cleaning involves removing noise, missing values, and outliers from the dataset. Noise refers to irrelevant or incorrect data, while missing values occur when some entries in the dataset are empty. Outliers are extreme values that deviate significantly from the rest of the data. Removing these elements ensures that the model learns from accurate and relevant information.

4. Feature extraction: This step involves selecting or creating new features that best represent the underlying patterns in the data. Feature extraction can help reduce dimensionality, improve computational efficiency, and enhance the model's ability to generalize.

5. Augmentation: Data augmentation generates additional training samples by applying transformations to existing ones. Common transformations include rotation, flipping, zooming, and cropping. Augmentation helps increase the diversity of the training data and reduces overfitting.
