The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in this context is primarily for classification tasks. Specifically, it is used for bird species recognition and identification. The model employs several techniques such as Chirplet transform, STFT, and Mel cepstrum transform to obtain spectrograms, which are then fed into a deep learning model for classification and recognition of different bird species. This approach has been successfully applied in various competitions like the BirdCLEF 2016 and BirdCLEF 2020, where researchers used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature learning and achieved good results. The deep learning model is designed with four convolution kernel pooling layers to extract deep features, followed by a fully connected layer for connection. It also includes a dropout layer to reduce network parameters and a Dense_1 layer to reduce the dimension of the deep features. The ultimate goal is to accurately classify and recognize different bird species based on their sounds.
