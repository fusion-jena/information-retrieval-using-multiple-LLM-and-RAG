Based on the given information, it appears that the study used several machine learning algorithms such as Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) to create an ensemble habitat suitability model. The performance of these models varied, with the RF model demonstrating the best overall performance while the GLM model showed the least favorable results.

To evaluate and compare the performance of each model, the researchers employed two commonly accepted evaluation metrics: Area Under Curve (AUC) and True Skill Statistic (TSS). These metrics helped categorize the models into different levels of performance ranging from excellent to poor.

However, there isn't any explicit mention of a specific strategy or methodology used to monitor the model performance during the training process. It can be assumed that standard practices like cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and early stopping might have been applied to optimize the models and prevent overfitting. But without further details, it cannot be confirmed which exact strategies were utilized for monitoring the model performance during training.
