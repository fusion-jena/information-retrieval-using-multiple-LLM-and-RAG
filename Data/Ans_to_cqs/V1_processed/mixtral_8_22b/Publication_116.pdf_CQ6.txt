Before training a deep learning model, various preprocessing steps may be required depending on the specific application and dataset. Some common preprocessing techniques include:

1. Normalization: Scaling input features or pixel values to have zero mean and unit variance. This helps stabilize the learning process and improve convergence speed. In the given context, it mentions that GoogleNet architecture uses batch normalization after all pooling layers.

2. Scaling: Rescaling input features or pixel values to fit within a certain range, such as between 0 and 1. This ensures that all inputs contribute equally during training and prevents any single feature from dominating the others.

3. Cleaning: Removing noise, outliers, or irrelevant information from the dataset. For example, removing blank spaces or unwanted characters from text data, or filling missing values in tabular datasets.

4. Data augmentation: Generating additional training samples by applying transformations like rotation, flipping, zooming, etc., to existing examples. This increases the diversity of the training set and improves the model's ability to generalize. The given context mentions simple crop and resize data augmentation being used with default settings of Caffe.

5. Transfer learning: Initializing model weights from a pretrained network instead of starting from scratch. This leverages knowledge gained from solving similar tasks and speeds up training time. In this case, they initialize the model parameters from an ImageNet previous training.
