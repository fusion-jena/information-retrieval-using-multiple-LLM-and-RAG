The given context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does provide some clues about the type of data being processed. The text refers to RGB color images and Near-Infrared (NIR) bands, suggesting that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is likely related to image processing. Furthermore, the discussion revolves around adjusting the DeepLabV3+ architecture, which is a convolutional neural network (CNN) primarily used for semantic segmentation tasks involving images. Therefore, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is most likely image data.
