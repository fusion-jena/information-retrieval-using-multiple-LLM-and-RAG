After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the application and requirements. Here are some commonly used ones:

1. Model Evaluation: Once the model has been trained, its performance needs to be evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC etc. These metrics help us understand how well the model performs on unseen data.

2. Confusion Matrix: It is a table layout that allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm. Each row of the matrix represents the instances in an actual class while each column represents the instances in a predicted class.

3. Saliency Maps: They are visual explanations of the decisions made by deep learning models. They highlight the pixels of input image that contribute most strongly to the output of the model.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning: Based on the results obtained during model evaluation, hyperparameters of the model may need to be adjusted to improve its performance. Techniques like Grid Search or Randomized Search can be employed for this purpose.

5. Predictions: Finally, once satisfied with the modelâ€™s performance, predictions can be made on new, unseen data.

In the given context, after the model training, simulated fields were created and map accuracy metrics were computed. Means were then calculated from these sampling distributions. This could be considered as part of the model evaluation step where the performance of the model is being assessed.
