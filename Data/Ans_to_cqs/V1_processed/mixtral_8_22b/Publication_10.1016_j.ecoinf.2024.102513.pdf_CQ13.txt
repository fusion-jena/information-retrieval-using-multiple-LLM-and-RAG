Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available in the given context to determine the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the type of optimizer employed. These details would typically be included in a description of the model architecture or training procedure, but they aren't mentioned here. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful response regarding the hyperparameters used in this particular case.
