Unfortunately, there isn't any specific mention or discussion about the methodologies employed for gathering raw data within the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive response based solely on the available information. However, it can generally involve various techniques such as utilizing sensor networks, conducting surveys, accessing publicly accessible databases, or even employing web scraping tools depending upon the nature of the problem being addressed.

Based on the context provided, we understand that the study focuses on developing a multi-temporal forecasting model of daily streamflow (Qflow) using machine learning methods. However, no explicit details were mentioned regarding how the raw data was collected. Typically, in similar studies involving hydrological modeling, researchers might use data obtained from meteorological stations, satellite imagery, or other relevant sources like water resource management agencies. Nonetheless, without further clarification, one cannot pinpoint the exact methods used for data collection in this specific scenario.
