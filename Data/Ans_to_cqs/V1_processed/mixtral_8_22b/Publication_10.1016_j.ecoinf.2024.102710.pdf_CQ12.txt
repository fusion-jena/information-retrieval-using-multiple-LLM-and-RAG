The pipeline uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as its primary deep learning model. Specifically, it tests two popular CNN architectures - ResNet152-V2 and VGG16 - which have been pre-trained on ImageNet, a dataset on the visual modality. Additionally, other variants like VGGish and YAMNet, based on VGG11A and MobileNet-V1 respectively, have been employed. These models were pre-trained on AudioSet, a dataset from the audio modality. Furthermore, BirdNet, another CNN architecture, has been utilized, which was specifically trained on bird vocalizations from focal recordings. The choice of using CNNs is likely because they excel in processing grid-like topologies, making them suitable for image or audio data.
