The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does discuss some aspects related to model training and evaluation. For instance, it mentions iterative training of new models with additional labeled data selected from their predictions, which suggests that the training process might continue until satisfactory results are achieved. Additionally, it refers to statistical comparisons between model predictions and known classes from a held-out part of the training dataset or an unrelated labeled dataset to guide decision making. This implies that evaluating the model's performance against such datasets could potentially serve as a criterion for determining when training is complete. Nevertheless, without more explicit information regarding the completion criteria, one cannot provide a definitive answer based solely on the given context.
