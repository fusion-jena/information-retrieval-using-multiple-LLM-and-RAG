Unfortunately, based on the given information, there is no mention of where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The text only mentions that the deep learning-related operations were performed in MATLAB 2020b equipped with specific toolboxes and processed on a GeForce RTX 2070 Super GPU. It does not specify any details about the availability of the code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information.
