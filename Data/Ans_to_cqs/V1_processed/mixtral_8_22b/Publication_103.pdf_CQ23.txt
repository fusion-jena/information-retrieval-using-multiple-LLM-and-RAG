To ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model, the authors conducted various experiments measuring the top-1 and top-5 accuracy of the trained model under different circumstances. These included herbarium specimens classification, transfer learning across herbarium data from different regions, and transfer learning from herbarium data to non-dried plant images.

In terms of diverse datasets, they utilized multiple datasets, including dataset A and dataset B, which likely contained varied samples to improve the model's ability to generalize well. Additionally, they employed transfer learning techniques to leverage knowledge gained from training on large datasets and apply it to smaller, more specific datasets. This approach can help prevent overfitting and enhance the model's adaptability to new tasks or domains.

However, there is no explicit mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting methods being applied in this context. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into subsets and iteratively training the model on different combinations of those subsets while validating its performance on the remaining subset. Stratified splitting ensures that the distribution of classes remains consistent between the training and validation sets. While these techniques could have been used to further validate the model's performance, they are not explicitly mentioned in the given information.
