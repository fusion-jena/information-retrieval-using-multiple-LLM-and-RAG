The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is primarily for classification tasks. Specifically, it aims to classify animal vocalizations or calls, such as those made by gibbons and whydah birds. The authors mention using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to develop models capable of distinguishing between different types of animal calls. They discuss the challenges associated with creating and utilizing CNNs for bioacoustic research questions, including the need for fixed input sizes, avoiding overfitting, and dealing with limited data availability. To address some of these issues, the authors propose using transfer learning techniques, specifically starting with a pre-trained ResNet152V2 model, to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their deep learning approach. Overall, the goal of the deep learning model is to enable researchers and practitioners to quickly and accurately identify and categorize animal calls, thereby facilitating further studies in bioacoustics and related fields.
