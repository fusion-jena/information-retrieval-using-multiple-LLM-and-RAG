The paper does not provide explicit details on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it mentions using a diverse dataset consisting of various land use types such as forest area, grassland area, cropland area, and orchard area. This suggests that the authors may have used a diverse dataset to train and validate their deep learning model. Additionally, the paper discusses different time periods (2000-2001, 2002-2008, 2009-2014, and 2015) for which the data was collected, indicating potential temporal diversity in the dataset. While the paper does not explicitly mention techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting, these methods are commonly employed to improve the generalizability of machine learning models. Therefore, it is possible that the authors might have utilized these techniques without specifically stating them in the given context.
