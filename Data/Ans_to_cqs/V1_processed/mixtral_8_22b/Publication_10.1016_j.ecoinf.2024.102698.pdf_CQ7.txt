Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, common practices in machine learning include splitting the dataset randomly or stratified by classes if dealing with classification tasks. Typically, the dataset is divided into three parts: training set (used to fit the model), validation set (used to tune hyperparameters during model development), and testing set (used to evaluate the final performance of the trained model). The proportion of each set varies, but a common practice is to use around 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. It should also be noted that the context mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN), autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks (GAN) for generating synthetic data, but does not provide details on how these methods were applied specifically for splitting the data.
