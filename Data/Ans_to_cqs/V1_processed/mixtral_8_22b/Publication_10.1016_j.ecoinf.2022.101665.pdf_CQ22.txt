The given context does not provide information about the evaluation metrics used for a deep learning model. However, it discusses the use of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Error Cost (MEC) as accuracy measures for evaluating the performance of a thematic map produced by a calibrated statistical prediction method. These metrics are used to compare the predicted values with the actual values in the target variable. Additionally, the context mentions the use of relative deviations of the accuracy estimates from their reference metrics, such as Relative RMSE (rRMSE), to express the differences as percentages.
