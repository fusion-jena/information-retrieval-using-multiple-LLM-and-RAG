Data augmentation techniques were applied to the tree samples in order to avoid distinguishing identical textures that only differ by orientation changes and to increase the amount of tree species samples for training the deep learning network. The specific data augmentation techniques mentioned include rotation, mirroring, and flipping of the tree samples in the form of patches. These techniques help to create more diverse training examples and improve the robustness of the model.

I do not know what data augmentation techniques were applied in the deep learning pipeline.
