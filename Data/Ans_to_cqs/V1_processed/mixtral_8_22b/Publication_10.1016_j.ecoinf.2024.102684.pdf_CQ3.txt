The context does not provide explicit details about specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for remote sensing applications. However, it mentions some common tasks in computer vision, including classification, regression, object detection, and semantic- and instance-based segmentation. These tasks imply various annotation methods, such as:

1. Classification: Labeling images into predefined categories, like plant species or land cover types.
2. Regression: Assigning continuous values to images, such as estimating plant coverage percentages.
3. Object detection: Identifying objects within images by drawing bounding boxes around them.
4. Semantic segmentation: Labeling each pixel in an image according to its category, such as separating vegetation from non-vegetated areas.
5. Instance segmentation: Similar to semantic segmentation but distinguishing individual instances of the same category, like identifying separate trees within a forest.

Although the context doesn't explicitly mention these annotation techniques, they are commonly employed in deep learning pipelines for computer vision tasks.
