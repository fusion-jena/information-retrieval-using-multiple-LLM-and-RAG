In this study, several data augmentation techniques were applied to increase the number and variability of the training data. These modifications included rotation, horizontal flip, vertical flip, width shift range, height shift range, shear range, zoom range, and brightness range. Each of these techniques contributes to enhancing the robustness and generalization capability of the deep learning model. Rotation involves rotating the image by a certain angle, while flipping refers to mirroring the image horizontally or vertically. Width and height shift ranges involve shifting the image along the x and y axes, respectively. Shearing distorts the image along one axis, creating a slanted effect. Zooming scales the image up or down, and adjusting the brightness range changes the overall lightness or darkness of the image. By implementing these data augmentation techniques, the researchers aimed to improve the model's ability to recognize patterns and features in various orientations, sizes, and lighting conditions.
