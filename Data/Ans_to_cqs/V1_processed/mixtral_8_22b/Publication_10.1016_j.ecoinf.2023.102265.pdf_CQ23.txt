The authors used a diverse dataset consisting of honey bee images with both 'natural' and 'anthropogenic' backgrounds to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model. Additionally, they employed a pre-trained ResNet-50 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for feature extraction, which was chosen based on its marginally higher validation accuracy compared to other depths such as ResNet-18 and ResNet-101. The use of a pre-trained model allowed them to leverage the knowledge gained from large datasets during the initial training phase, thereby improving the model's ability to generalize to new data. However, the paper does not explicitly mention any specific techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting to further enhance the model's generalization capabilities.
