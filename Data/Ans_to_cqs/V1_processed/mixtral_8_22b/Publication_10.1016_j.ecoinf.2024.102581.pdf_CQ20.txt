For training the deep learning models, the researchers utilized an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 GPU. This GPU has 8 GB of GDDR6 VRAM and 2944 CUDA cores, which helped accelerate neural network training and inference. Additionally, they used a memory bus width of 256 bits for efficient data transfer and employed the CUDA Toolkit version 11.1 for GPU-based computations.
