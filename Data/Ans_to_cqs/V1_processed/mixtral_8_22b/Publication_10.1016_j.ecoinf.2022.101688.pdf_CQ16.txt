Based on the given information, it does not explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, common practices in machine learning include monitoring metrics such as validation loss, accuracy, or other performance indicators during the training process. When these metrics reach a plateau or stop improving significantly, it may indicate that the model has converged and further training would not yield substantial improvements. This concept is often referred to as early stopping, which helps prevent overfitting and saves computational resources. In summary, while the exact criteria are not specified in the provided context, typical approaches involve observing validation metrics and employing techniques like early stopping to decide when training should conclude.
