The text does not provide information on specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that BirdNET uses a deep neural network to analyze sound recordings and identify over 3000 bird species. It also refers to previous studies evaluating BirdNET's performance in detecting certain bird species, but it does not mention any specific datasets used in those studies. Therefore, based on the given context, there is no clear answer to what datasets were used in the deep learning pipeline.
