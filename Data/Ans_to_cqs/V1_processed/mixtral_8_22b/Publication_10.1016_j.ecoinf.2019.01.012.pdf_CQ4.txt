Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. However, it discusses the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks, specifically focusing on the classification of digital images using machine learning and deep learning methods.

In general, data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotation, and scaling can help improve the performance of deep learning models by increasing the amount of available training data and introducing variations in the dataset. These techniques can be especially useful when working with limited datasets or when dealing with imbalanced classes.

While the context does not directly address the application of data augmentation techniques, it mentions that the model requires large amounts of labeled training data. Therefore, one could infer that data augmentation might have been employed to enhance the training dataset and improve the overall performance of the deep learning model. Nonetheless, without explicit information regarding the use of specific data augmentation techniques, this remains speculative.
