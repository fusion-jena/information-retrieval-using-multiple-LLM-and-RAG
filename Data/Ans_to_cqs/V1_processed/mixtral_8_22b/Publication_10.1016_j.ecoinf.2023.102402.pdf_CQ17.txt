In the given context, there is no direct mention of specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization used in a deep learning pipeline to prevent overfitting. However, we can infer that some form of regularization has been applied based on the use of a regularization multiplier in the Maxent modeling process. The regularization multiplier is a parameter used in Maxent to control the strength of regularization, which helps prevent overfitting by penalizing complex models. In this case, the regularization multiplier was obtained through ENMeval analysis, which is a tool used to evaluate and select optimal settings for species distribution models like Maxent. While not explicitly stated, it is possible that the regularization multiplier could have been derived from techniques similar to L2 regularization, where a penalty term is added to the loss function during optimization. Nonetheless, without further information, it cannot be confirmed if other common regularization methods like dropout were employed in the deep learning pipeline.
