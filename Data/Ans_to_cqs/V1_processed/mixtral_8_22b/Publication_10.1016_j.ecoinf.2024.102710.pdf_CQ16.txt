Based on the given context, the specific criteria for determining when training is complete are not explicitly mentioned. However, some clues can be derived from the information provided. For instance, the text mentions that the active learning experiments are carried out in the embedding space of the selected transfer learning model, BirdNet-1. This suggests that the completion of training might be linked to the performance of this model. Furthermore, the context discusses various sampling strategies employed during the active learning phase, including uncertainty and diversity-based methods, myopic (greedy), and adaptive (batch mode) methods. These strategies could also influence the determination of when training is considered complete. Lastly, the context notes that class labels are available for all samples used in this study, and an active learning scenario is emulated by hiding all labels from the classifier initially and incrementally revealing them for each batch of samples queried by the sampling methods. This implies that the progression of label revelation and the corresponding improvement in classification performance could serve as indicators for concluding the training process. Nonetheless, without explicit mention of the criteria for determining when training is complete, one cannot definitively state what these criteria are.
