The postprocessing steps involved after the model training include several methods such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, confusion matrix, etc. However, based on the given context, it appears that the authors have primarily focused on evaluating the model performance through cross-validation and calculating the Area Under the Receiving Operator Characteristics Curve (AUC) as the metric for specifying the accuracy of their ensemble model. They used 70% of the dataset as training data to build the models and the remaining 30% as testing data to calculate the models' accuracy. The AUC is a scale ranging from 0.5 to 1.0, where a higher AUC value indicates that the model is more accurate. Therefore, based on the given context, the primary postprocessing step involved after the model training was the evaluation of the model performance using cross-validation and AUC calculation. Other postprocessing techniques like saliency maps or confusion matrices were not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
