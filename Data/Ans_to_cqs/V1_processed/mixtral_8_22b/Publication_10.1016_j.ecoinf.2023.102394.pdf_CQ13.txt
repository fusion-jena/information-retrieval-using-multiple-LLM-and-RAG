Based on the given information, it appears that the authors have utilized a deep learning algorithm called the multilayer perceptron (MLP) for their SOCS modeling. However, there is no explicit mention of the specific hyperparameters used in this model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. To find these details, one would need access to additional information, such as the source code or further documentation related to the implementation of the MLP model.

It should be noted that the text does mention that the parameter selection was performed by minimizing the mean squared error. Additionally, Table 2 is referenced as containing the parameter settings of the MLP model. Unfortunately, without direct access to this table, we cannot provide any further insight into the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
