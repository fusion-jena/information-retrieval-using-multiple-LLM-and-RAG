The text does not provide explicit information about the specific preprocessing steps used before training a deep learning model. However, it mentions that developers could use the code in supplement S1 to implement more predictor variables and write a custom algorithm. This suggests that some form of feature engineering or selection might have been performed during preprocessing. Additionally, the authors mention using both uninformative and informative priors, which implies that they may have applied techniques such as standardization or normalization to ensure that all input features contribute equally to the model's predictions. Furthermore, since the study focuses on bat call detection and classification, it is likely that audio signal processing techniques were employed to extract relevant features from the raw sound recordings. These techniques might include noise reduction, filtering, segmentation, and transformation into spectrograms or other time-frequency representations suitable for convolutional neural network analysis.
