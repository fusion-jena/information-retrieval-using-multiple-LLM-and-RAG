In the given context, there isn't a direct mention of specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, based on common machine learning practices, one possible criterion could be related to the number of iterations or epochs during training. In Table 3, it is mentioned that the "# of iterations" parameter has been set to a range between 7132â€“9756. This suggests that the model might have been trained until reaching a certain iteration count, rather than using other stopping criteria such as early stopping or convergence of validation loss. Nonetheless, without explicit information about the chosen criteria, it can only be speculated that the training process may have continued until the specified maximum number of iterations was reached.
