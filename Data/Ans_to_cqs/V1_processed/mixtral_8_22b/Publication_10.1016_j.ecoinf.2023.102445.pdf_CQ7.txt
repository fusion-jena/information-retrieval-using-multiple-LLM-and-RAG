Unfortunately, there isn't any explicit mention of how the dataset was divided into training, testing, or validation sets within the given context. However, it does state that a total of ten ablation experiments were carried out, each utilizing a distinct network structure based on YOLOv8. Each experiment employed a batch size of 16, an input image resolution of 640 x 640 pixels, and a fixed learning rate of 0.01. Furthermore, the Adam optimizer was utilized, along with specific values assigned to parameters such as depth_scale and width_scale. Despite these details, no clear indication exists regarding the division of datasets for training, testing, or validation purposes.
