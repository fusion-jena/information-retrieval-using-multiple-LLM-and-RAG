In this study, the method used for collecting raw data is acoustic monitoring. An acoustic recorder called Song Meter SM2 recorder by Wildlife Acoustics was deployed at each site. These recorders were active from June 2015 to May 2016 and were set to record the first 15 minutes of every hour. The recordings were saved in.wav format with a sampling rate of 48 kHz and 16 bits per sample resolution. The devices were regularly checked to download data and replace batteries. This resulted in a total of 32,023 15-minute recordings, amounting to approximately 8006 hours of recording across all sites.
