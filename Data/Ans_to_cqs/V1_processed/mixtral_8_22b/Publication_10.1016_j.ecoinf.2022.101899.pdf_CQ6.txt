While the given context does not directly address the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, it provides insights into some aspects of preparing data for such models. Based on general practices in machine learning and deep learning, common preprocessing steps include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistent entries in the dataset. It ensures that the input data is accurate and reliable for training the model.

2. Feature Scaling/Normalization: Deep learning algorithms often perform better when numerical input variables are scaled to a standard range, typically between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. Normalizing the features helps prevent any single feature from dominating the others due to its scale, which may lead to poor performance during training.

3. Encoding Categorical Variables: Since neural networks only work with numerical inputs, categorical variables need to be converted into numerical form. Techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding can be used depending on the nature of the variable.

4. Splitting Dataset: Before training the model, the dataset should be divided into three subsets: training, validation, and testing sets. Typically, the split is around 60-80% for training, 10-20% for validation, and 10-20% for testing.

5. Data Augmentation: To improve the robustness and generalizability of the model, synthetic data can be generated through techniques like rotation, zooming, flipping, etc., especially useful for image datasets.

In summary, while the exact preprocessing steps depend on the specific requirements of the problem and the characteristics of the dataset, common steps involve data cleaning, feature scaling, encoding categorical variables, splitting the dataset, and potentially applying data augmentation techniques.
