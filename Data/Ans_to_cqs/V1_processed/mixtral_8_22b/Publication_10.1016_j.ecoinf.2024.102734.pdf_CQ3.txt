Based on the given context, there isn't specific information about the exact data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that some form of manual review or verification was conducted on each segment of the dataset, as mentioned in the statement "Each segment has been manually reviewed by a human." This suggests that human input was involved in the annotation process. Additionally, the paper titled "How to Annotate 100 Hours in 45 Minutes" might provide insights into the annotation techniques used, but without access to this source, it cannot be confirmed. Therefore, while it is clear that manual review was part of the annotation process, the specific techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
