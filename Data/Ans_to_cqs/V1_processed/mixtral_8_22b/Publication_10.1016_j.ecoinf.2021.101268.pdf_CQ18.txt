The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves evaluating the accuracy of the models on three distinct subsets of data: train, validation, and test. The table presented shows the accuracy results for various models such as AlexNet, VGG-19, ResNet-101, and DenseNet-201 under two conditions: raw and pre-processed. For each condition, the accuracy is reported for all three subsets of data. This approach allows for tracking the progress of the models throughout the training phase and assessing their ability to generalize to unseen data. Additionally, Table 5 presents the accuracy of the models when swapping the testing sets between raw and pre-processed images, providing further insights into the models' adaptability and robustness.
