The paper uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model called DeepLabV3+. The CNN model has four convolutional layers and a fully connected layer with 100 hidden units. The 3D convolution filters in the convolutional layers have specific dimensions mentioned in the text. The naming convention used for the convolutional layers indicates the number of filters and the filter size. The stride in all four convolution layers is set to 1. The table provided shows various training parameters used in DeepLabV3+, including the base learning rate, learning rate decay factor, momentum, train batch size, weight decay, and others.
