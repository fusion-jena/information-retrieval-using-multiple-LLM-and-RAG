To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures have been taken. Firstly, the dataset used for training consists of 3000 5s segments, including both possum vocalizations and noise sources. This diverse dataset helps prevent overfitting and improves the model's ability to handle various types of input. Secondly, the dataset was divided into an 80/20% training-validation split, allowing for evaluation of the model's performance during training. Thirdly, the distribution of target features to non-target features in the test dataset is representative of the true distribution post-segmentation. This ensures that the model can accurately classify new, unseen data. Lastly, both validation and test dataset performances are reported, providing insight into how well the model performs on different sets of data. These measures help ensure that the deep learning model is robust and capable of handling real-world scenarios.
