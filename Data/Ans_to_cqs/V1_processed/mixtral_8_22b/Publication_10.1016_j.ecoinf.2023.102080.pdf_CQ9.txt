Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The table provided only discusses the functions available in the covsel R package, their descriptions, common inputs, and specific arguments. It does not mention any information about a deep learning pipeline or its associated data repository. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer based solely on this context.
