The paper by Zhong, L., Hu, L., & Zhou, H. (2019) titled "Deep Learning Based Multi-Temporal Crop Classification" mentions the use of a deep learning model for their research. However, it does not explicitly state which specific type of deep learning model was used in their pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding whether they used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer model. It would be best to refer directly to the mentioned study for more detailed information about the deep learning model employed in their work.
