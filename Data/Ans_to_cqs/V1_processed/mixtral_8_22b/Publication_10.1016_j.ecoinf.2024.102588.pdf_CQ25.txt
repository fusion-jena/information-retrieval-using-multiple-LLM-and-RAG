The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred based on the information provided. The authors use a combination of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and an autoencoder to estimate aquatic ecosystem health indices, namely TDI, BMI, and FAI. This suggests that the primary goal of their deep learning model is to perform regression analysis, which involves predicting continuous values rather than classifying or detecting objects within images.

In general, deep learning models can serve various purposes depending on their design and application. Some common types include:

1. Classification: These models categorize inputs into specific classes or labels. For example, identifying whether an image contains a cat or a dog.

2. Object detection: These models locate and identify objects within an image, often drawing bounding boxes around detected items.

3. Semantic segmentation: These models assign each pixel in an image to a particular class, creating a detailed map of different elements present in the scene.

4. Instance segmentation: Similar to semantic segmentation, instance segmentation identifies individual instances of objects within an image while also distinguishing between overlapping items.

5. Regression: As mentioned earlier, regression models aim to predict continuous values instead of discrete categories. They might be used to forecast temperature changes over time or estimate real estate prices based on various factors.

Given the context provided, it appears that the researchers employed a deep learning model for regression purposes to estimate aquatic ecosystem health indices accurately.
