The papers cited do not explicitly discuss the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it is common practice in machine learning to use metrics such as validation loss or accuracy to monitor the progress of model training and decide when to stop. Typically, if the validation loss stops decreasing significantly or starts to increase, this could indicate overfitting, and it might be time to stop training. Similarly, if the validation accuracy has reached a satisfactory level and no longer improves, this could also suggest that further training may not yield significant benefits. It should be noted that these criteria depend on the specific problem and goals of the project.
