The text does not provide explicit information about the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the goal was to apply minimal preprocessing to demonstrate the power of human-machine teaming. This suggests that the focus might have been more on showcasing the capabilities of the models rather than fine-tuning them using advanced techniques like dropout or L2 regularization. Nevertheless, without further details, it cannot be confirmed whether these methods were employed or not.
