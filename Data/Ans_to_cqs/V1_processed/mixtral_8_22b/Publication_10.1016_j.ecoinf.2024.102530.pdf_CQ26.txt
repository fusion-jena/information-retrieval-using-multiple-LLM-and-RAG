In order to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing subsets while maintaining the same distribution of classes or labels within both subsets. This ensures that the model does not become biased towards any particular class due to uneven representation in the training set.

Oversampling is a technique where synthetic samples are generated from existing minority class examples to balance out the dataset. This helps prevent the model from being overly influenced by the majority class. Undersampling, on the other hand, involves removing instances from the majority class until it matches the size of the minority class. While this may lead to loss of information, it can help reduce bias caused by imbalanced datasets.

Diverse data collection refers to gathering data from various sources and perspectives to ensure that the dataset accurately represents real-world scenarios. By incorporating different viewpoints and experiences, the resulting model becomes more robust and generalizable across multiple domains.

These techniques play crucial roles in mitigating data bias during preprocessing of deep learning pipelines, ultimately leading to improved model performance and fairness.
