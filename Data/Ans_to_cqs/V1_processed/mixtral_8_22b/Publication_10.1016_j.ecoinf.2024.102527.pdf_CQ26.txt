The given context does not provide explicit information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, some relevant information regarding data splitting and handling of potential biases can be found.

In the context, it is mentioned that when dealing with the SS dataset as the target domain dataset, they maintained the integrity of events during data splitting by placing all images of an event into the same dataset. This approach helps avoid potential biases caused by having highly similar images in both training and testing sets, which could negatively impact the DCNN model's ability to generalize effectively.

Additionally, while creating various training sets containing different numbers of samples (2000, 5000, 8000, 10,000, and 20,000), these sets were labeled as S\_2, S\_5, S\_8, S\_10, and S\_20, respectively. Although this doesn't explicitly mention any technique to handle class imbalance, it suggests that the authors might have considered balancing the classes while selecting the samples for their training sets.

Overall, based on the provided context, it appears that the authors took steps to maintain the integrity of events during data splitting and possibly balanced the classes while creating their training sets. However, without more detailed information, it cannot be confirmed whether they specifically applied techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection to address data bias during preprocessing.
