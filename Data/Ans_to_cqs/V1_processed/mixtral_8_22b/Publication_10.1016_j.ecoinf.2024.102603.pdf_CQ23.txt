The given context does not provide information about any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, based on common practices in machine learning, some possible ways to improve the generalizability of a deep learning model include using diverse datasets, implementing cross-validation techniques, and employing stratified splitting during the training phase. These strategies help prevent overfitting and enhance the model's ability to perform well on new, unseen data. Unfortunately, without further details regarding the development and implementation of the deep learning model mentioned in the context, it is impossible to determine which, if any, of these approaches were utilized.
