Two datasets mentioned in the given context are LifeCLEF14 and LifeCLEF15 fish datasets. Salman et al., (2016) used these datasets to compare traditional classification methods such as SVM, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Sparse Representation Classifier with CNN. They achieved an average classification rate of more than 90% on these datasets using CNN. Another dataset mentioned is the Brackish Dataset, presented by Pedersen et al., (2019). This dataset contains bounding box annotated sequences of images containing various marine creatures like big fish, small fish, starfish, shrimps, jellyfish, and crabs. This dataset was used to fine-tune and test the YOLOv2 and YOLOv3 CNNs. However, it should be noted that these systems support a detection process rather than a recognition or identification process, which is required in the problem setting discussed in the context.
