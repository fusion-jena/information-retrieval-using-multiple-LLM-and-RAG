Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no information about where the code repository for the deep learning pipeline is available. The context only provides details about various research papers and authors related to remote sensing, vegetation patterns, and deep learning techniques used for classification and monitoring native vegetation. It does not mention any specific code repositories or links to them. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline.
