The text does not provide explicit information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that during the DeepLabV3+ model training process, remote sensing images and semantic labels of land cover classes are cut into a series of regular image blocks for input. This suggests that some form of semantic segmentation annotation might be used, where each pixel in the image is assigned a class label. Additionally, the text describes how the training set is enhanced through flipping, exchanging between multiple image channels, random rotation, and adding noise to the images. These techniques can help improve the robustness and generalization ability of the model but do not explicitly indicate any particular data annotation technique. Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot definitively state what data annotation techniques are used in the deep learning pipeline.
