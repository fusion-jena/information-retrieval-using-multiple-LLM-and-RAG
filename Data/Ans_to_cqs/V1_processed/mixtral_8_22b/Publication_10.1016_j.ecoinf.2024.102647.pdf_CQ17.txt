In the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization being used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) as a method for feature selection. While not directly mentioned as a regularization technique, RFE can help reduce overfitting by removing irrelevant features, which in turn simplifies the model and reduces its complexity. This process can be seen as a form of regularization, although it doesn't fall into the categories of dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, based on the provided context, while we cannot confirm the use of dropout or L2 regularization, we do see evidence of using RFE as a potential means to mitigate overfitting.
