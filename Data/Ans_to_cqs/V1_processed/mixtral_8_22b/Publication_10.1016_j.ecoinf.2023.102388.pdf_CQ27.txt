Unfortunately, based on the given context, there isn't enough information to provide a detailed answer regarding the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. Typically, once a deep learning model is trained, it can be serialized or saved into a file format that can be loaded later for making predictions. Commonly used formats include.h5,.onnx,.pb, etc. Depending on the platform where the model will be deployed, additional steps may be required, such as converting the model to a different format or optimizing it for better performance. Popular platforms for deploying deep learning models include TensorFlow Serving, ONNX Runtime, AWS SageMaker, Google Cloud AI Platform, Azure Machine Learning, etc. Each platform offers its own unique features and benefits, so the choice depends on factors such as cost, ease of use, scalability, integration with other services, etc. However, without further details about the specific scenario, I cannot provide a more precise answer.
