The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, based on the information provided, it appears that the deep learning model is primarily used for time-series prediction. Specifically, the mentioned SLSTM and SGRU models are employed for predicting agricultural product sales and the Pacific decadal oscillation index, respectively. These predictions aim to reduce production risks, facilitate agricultural planning, and minimize post-production price fluctuations. Therefore, the primary objective of these deep learning models seems to be accurate forecasting rather than tasks such as classification, segmentation, or detection.
