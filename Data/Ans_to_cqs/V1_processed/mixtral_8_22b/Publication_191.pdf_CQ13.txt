The text provides information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. The learning rate was initially set to 10^-3, and then decreased by a factor of 10 when the validation set accuracy stopped improving. The momentum was set to 0.9, and the weight decay was set to 10^-4. However, the type of optimizer used is not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
