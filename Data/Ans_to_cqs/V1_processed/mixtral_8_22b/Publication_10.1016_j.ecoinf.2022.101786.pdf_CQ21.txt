After the model training, there are several postprocessing steps that can be taken to evaluate the performance of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Some common postprocessing steps include calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the curve (AUC), which help assess the overall performance of the model. Additionally, confusion matrices can be generated to visualize the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative rates for each class. This provides insight into how well the model is performing for each individual class. Another useful tool is saliency maps, which highlight areas of the input image that contribute most significantly to the final classification decision made by the CNN. This helps identify any biases or errors in the model's decision making process. It should be noted that these postprocessing steps can take several hours to perform, depending on the size of the dataset and computational power available. However, they provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the model and can guide future improvements.
