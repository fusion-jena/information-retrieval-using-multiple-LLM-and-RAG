Based on the provided information, it appears that the training process for the models mentioned involves completing a set number of iterations through the entire dataset. Specifically, the text states that both models underwent 50 complete iterations of processing the full dataset during training. Therefore, one criterion used to determine when training is complete could be reaching a predetermined number of epochs or iterations through the dataset.

However, the context does not explicitly mention any specific criteria such as validation loss plateau being used to determine when training should stop. Validation loss plateau refers to a point where the validation loss stops decreasing significantly with each iteration, indicating that further training would not improve the model's performance. Other common criteria include early stopping, which ends training if the validation error does not decrease after a certain number of epochs, and maximum runtime, which limits the amount of time spent on training.

Without more detailed information about the training process, it is difficult to definitively state what criteria are used to determine when training is complete. Nonetheless, based on the available context, it can be inferred that one possible criterion is reaching a predefined number of epochs or iterations through the dataset.
