The given context does not provide information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only discusses details about the architecture of the decoder, the use of the Adam optimizer, and the exploration of various parameter values during the training process. However, there is no mention of any specific platform like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket where the code might be hosted. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available based on the provided context.
