Based on the given context, there are two main types of deep learning models mentioned: ResNet152 and SincNet.

ResNet152 is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture that has been adapted for audio classification tasks. It is originally designed for image classification tasks, but in this case, it has been modified by converting sound frames into mel spectrograms before feeding them into the network. This indicates that the authors have utilized a CNN-based approach for their task.

On the other hand, SincNet is also a type of CNN architecture specifically designed for speech recognition tasks. However, the context does not provide explicit details about how SincNet is being used or whether it is part of the primary pipeline. Therefore, while it can be assumed that SincNet is also a CNN-based model, its role in the overall pipeline remains unclear without further context.

In summary, the pipeline primarily uses a CNN-based approach, specifically the ResNet152 architecture, which has been adapted for audio classification tasks. Additionally, SincNet, another CNN-based model, may also play a role in the pipeline, although its exact function is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
