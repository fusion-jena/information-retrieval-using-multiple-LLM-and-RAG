The information regarding the availability of the deep learning pipeline data repository is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query. However, common repositories where such datasets are often made available include Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, and GBIF. It would be best to refer to any associated publications or documentation related to the deep learning pipeline for more accurate information.

Based on the provided context, it appears that the study does not directly mention the use of a deep learning pipeline or its corresponding dataset. Instead, the focus seems to be on using satellite images and machine learning techniques like Support Vector Machines (SVM) for land cover classification. The sources cited in the text primarily discuss wetlands, agroforestry, and modeling grassland biomass rather than providing details about a deep learning pipeline or its data repository.
