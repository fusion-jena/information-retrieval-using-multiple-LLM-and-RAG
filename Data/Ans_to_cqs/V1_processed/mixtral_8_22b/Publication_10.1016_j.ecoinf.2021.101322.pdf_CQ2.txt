Based on the given context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily uses images as its data format. The research article mentions using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification tasks, specifically focusing on classifying salmon scales. Two datasets are mentioned: the Salmon Scale 9056 Image Dataset and an additional Expert Reading of Extra 150 Image Dataset. Both datasets contain images, which suggests that the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is indeed images. There is no mention of other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV files being utilized in the provided context.
