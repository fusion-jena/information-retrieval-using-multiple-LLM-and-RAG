In this study, the authors employ a hybrid hyperparameter optimization scheme (HHOS) to optimize the hyperparameters of their models. HHOS is a combination of two popular hyperparameter optimization techniques - manual search and random search.

Firstly, the manual search technique is applied to narrow down the search space by identifying commonly used hyperparameter configurations from previous research relevant to the problem at hand. This step involves leveraging expert knowledge and experience to select hyperparameters that have shown promising results in similar tasks or domains.

Once the search space has been reduced through manual search, the next step is to apply the random search technique. Random search works by randomly sampling different combinations of hyperparameter values from the previously defined search space. Each sampled combination is then used to train a new instance of the model, and its performance is evaluated using the dataset for model evaluation (D). This process continues until the best performing hyperparameter configuration is found.

By combining these two approaches, HHOS offers several advantages. It allows for a more efficient exploration of the hyperparameter space while still maintaining a level of control over the search process. Additionally, HHOS improves upon the limitations of individual methods such as manual search, which can be subjective and limited by human expertise, and random search, which can be computationally intensive and prone to variability due to its inherent randomness.

However, there are also potential drawbacks associated with HHOS. For example, the success of the manual search component depends largely on the availability and quality of expert knowledge. Furthermore, the random search component may require a significant number of iterations before converging on an optimal solution, leading to increased computational costs and time requirements. Nonetheless, when properly implemented, HHOS provides a powerful tool for optimizing hyperparameters across diverse problem domains.
