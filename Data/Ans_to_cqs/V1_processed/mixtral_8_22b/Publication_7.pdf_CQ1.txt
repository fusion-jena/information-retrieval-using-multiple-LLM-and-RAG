The authors utilize a subset of the Benthoz15 dataset, which contains expert-annotated and geo-referenced marine images from Australian seas. This dataset has been fine-tuned using the weights of a pre-trained VGGnet. The specific method for collecting the raw data is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, it can be inferred that the data collection process likely involved underwater imagery or photography, considering the nature of the dataset and its application in marine research. Additionally, the dataset includes expert annotations, suggesting human involvement in labeling the images. Publicly available datasets like ImageNet may also have been used during the training phase of the deep learning pipeline.
