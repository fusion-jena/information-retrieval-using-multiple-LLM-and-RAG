The text does not provide specific information about how the hyperparameters of the XGBoost ensemble model were optimized. However, it mentions that XGBoost was introduced as an efficient and distributed gradient boosting algorithm with rapidly optimized hyperparameters. This suggests that some form of optimization technique was employed, but without further details, we cannot determine whether it was grid search, random search, or another method.

Based on general knowledge, common methods for optimizing hyperparameters include grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and evolutionary algorithms. Grid search involves testing all possible combinations of hyperparameter values within a predefined range, while random search randomly samples from the same space. Bayesian optimization uses probabilistic models to guide the search process, and evolutionary algorithms employ principles inspired by natural selection to evolve optimal solutions over time. Without more specific information, it is impossible to identify the exact method used for optimizing the hyperparameters of the XGBoost ensemble model described in the text.
