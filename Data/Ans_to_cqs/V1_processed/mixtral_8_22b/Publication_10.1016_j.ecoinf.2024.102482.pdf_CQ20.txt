Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available from the given context to determine which specific hardware resources were used for training the deep learning model. The text does mention that the model was designed to work well on devices with limited computing power, but it doesn't specify whether GPUs, TPUs, or other types of hardware accelerators were utilized during the training process. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based solely on the provided context.
