Based on the given context, there is no direct mention of specific criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, we can infer from the text that the process involves selecting individual redescriptions for further analysis based on certain requirements such as accuracy gain and simplicity of queries.

In the first run, the selection was made using only conjunctions, while in the second run, the requirement of accuracy gain was tightened. Under this constraint, a candidate query could be extended by automatically adding the next variable only if the accuracy, as measured by the Jaccard coefficient, increased by at least 0.1. The goal here was to obtain interpretable, not overly complex (long) queries.

From these runs, the top-ten remaining redescriptions were inspected more closely. These were denoted as R1.1–R1.10 for the first run and R2.1–R2.10 for the second run. All the selected redescriptions had s close to zero, without correction for multiple testing which is not yet possible with existing methods.

Therefore, although the exact criteria for determining when training is complete are not mentioned, we can see that the process involves selecting redescriptions based on accuracy and simplicity of queries, aiming to achieve interpretable results.
