The deep learning model mentioned in the given context uses the PyTorch framework. This is evident from the statement where it says, "Networks using implicit pooling (determined using pytorch)" indicating that PyTorch is being used to determine the type of pooling in the neural network. Furthermore, there is no mention of any other deep learning framework such as TensorFlow or Keras, strengthening the conclusion that PyTorch is the primary framework used in building the deep learning model.
