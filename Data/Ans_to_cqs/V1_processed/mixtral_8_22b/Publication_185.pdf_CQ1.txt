Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in this particular deep learning pipeline. However, generally speaking, raw data collection methods in deep learning pipelines may include various techniques such as utilizing publicly available datasets, employing sensors or devices to gather real-time data, conducting surveys, or even scraping data from websites. In this case, since the research focuses on butterfly classification, one might infer that the researchers collected images of butterflies either from existing databases or captured them using cameras or other imaging devices. Nevertheless, without further details, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer regarding the exact methods employed for gathering raw data in this study.
