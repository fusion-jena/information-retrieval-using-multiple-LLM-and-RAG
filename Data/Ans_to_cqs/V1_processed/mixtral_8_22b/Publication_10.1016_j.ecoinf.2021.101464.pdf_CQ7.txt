Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, or validation sets. However, typically, the dataset is divided into three parts: training set, validation set, and testing set. The most common approach is to use a ratio such as 70:15:15 or 80:10:10 for splitting the data. This means that if we have 1000 instances, then 700 would be used for training, 150 for validation, and 150 for testing. Another popular method is k-fold cross-validation, where the original sample is randomly partitioned into k equal sized subsamples. Of the k subsamples, a single subsample is retained as the validation data for testing the model, and the remaining k âˆ’ 1 subsamples are used as training data. The cross-validation process is then repeated k times, with each of the k subsamples used exactly once as the validation data. The k results can then be averaged to produce a single estimation.
