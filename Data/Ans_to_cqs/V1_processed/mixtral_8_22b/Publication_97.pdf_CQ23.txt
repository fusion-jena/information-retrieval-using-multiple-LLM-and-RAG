The authors did not explicitly mention any specific techniques such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model. However, they did employ several strategies during the training process that could contribute to improving the model's ability to generalize well. These include:

1. Randomly generating batches of training images: By creating random crops of source images and applying data augmentation, the authors ensured that the model would be exposed to various image transformations and features, thus helping it learn more robust representations. This approach can help improve the model's performance on unseen data and reduce overfitting.

2. Using dropout regularization: Dropout is a technique used to prevent overfitting by randomly deactivating neurons during training. In this study, the authors included dropout with a rate of 0.5 in some of their best performing models. This means that half of the neurons in certain layers were temporarily removed during training, forcing the remaining neurons to adapt and learn more meaningful representations. Consequently, this helps the model become more resilient to variations in input data and improves its capacity to generalize.

3. Applying batch normalization: Batch normalization is another method employed by the authors to enhance the model's generalization capabilities. It works by standardizing the inputs to each layer during training, which has been shown to accelerate convergence and improve overall performance. Additionally, batch normalization can act as a form of regularization, making the model less sensitive to changes in input distribution and promoting better generalization.

In summary, while the authors did not directly address the issue of ensuring the generalizability of their deep learning model using traditional methods like diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, they implemented several strategies during the training process that could indirectly contribute to enhancing the model's ability to generalize well. These strategies include randomly generating batches of training images, using dropout regularization, and applying batch normalization.
