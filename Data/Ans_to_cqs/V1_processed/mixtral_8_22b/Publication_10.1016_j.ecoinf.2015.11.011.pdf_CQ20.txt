The given text does not provide information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer based solely on this context. However, generally speaking, deep learning models often require significant computational power, and GPU accelerators are commonly used for training them due to their ability to perform parallel processing tasks efficiently.
