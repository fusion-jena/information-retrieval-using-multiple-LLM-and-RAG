The text does not provide explicit information about the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, there are some clues that suggest possible steps taken during the deployment phase. For instance, the mention of Azure-based development and model deployment in Whiskerbook.org indicates that the cloud computing service offered by Microsoft, called Azure, might have been utilized for deploying the models. This implies that the models may have undergone model serialization, which involves converting them into a format suitable for storage or transmission, before being deployed onto the platform. Additionally, since the researchers contributed their dataset to Whiskerbook.org, it is likely that the platform was selected for hosting and sharing the developed deep learning models with other researchers. Nevertheless, without further details regarding the exact deployment procedure, one cannot definitively state the precise steps involved in the process.
