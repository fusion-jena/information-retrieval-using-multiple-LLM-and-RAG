The given context does not provide information on the specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. Instead, it focuses on comparing different audio recording systems for detecting and monitoring songbirds, discussing the utility of acoustic indices for ecological monitoring, and addressing differences between recording devices. Therefore, based on this context alone, we cannot determine the exact hyperparameters used in any potential deep learning models.
