Based on the given context, one technique used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline is data augmentation. This involves increasing the size of the training dataset through random variations and manipulations to the data. In this case, five augmented images were created per original tile to generate additional tiles for both sites. The augmentations applied included flipping, cropping, contrast shifting, translation, and rotation. However, the exact parameters or ranges for these augmentations are not specified in the provided context. It should also be noted that while data augmentation helps to reduce overfitting by providing the model with more varied examples, it doesn't directly address class imbalance, which is another form of data bias. Other techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection mentioned in the query are not explicitly discussed in the provided context. Therefore, their use in this particular study cannot be confirmed.
