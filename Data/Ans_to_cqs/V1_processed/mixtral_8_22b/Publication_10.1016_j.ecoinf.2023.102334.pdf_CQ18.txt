To monitor the model performance during training, the introduced model was compared with five other models while keeping the experimental method and environment unchanged. Each model was trained, and the training results were illustrated in Figure 11. The model in this work was distinguished by a low loss rate and high accuracy, indicating stability due to its reasonably smooth curves and small fluctuations during training and testing. Additionally, under the condition of unchanged training methods and parameters, the results of each model were obtained and listed in Table 3. This comparison allowed for the evaluation of the proposed model's performance against other established models such as VGG, DenseNet, and Swin Transformer.
