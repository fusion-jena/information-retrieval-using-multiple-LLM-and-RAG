The given context does not provide information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. The text only mentions that the weights were obtained from an already trained implementation of DeeplabV3+ using the COCO dataset but does not specify the hardware used during the training process. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which hardware resources were utilized for training the deep learning model based solely on the provided context.
