The information provided does not explicitly state the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer some details about the data types used in Species Distribution Models (SDMs) preparation. Visual data was the most commonly used data type (84%), followed by satellite tracking data (13%) and acoustic recordings (11%). For sea turtle studies, satellite tracking devices were more common (67%) compared to visual data (33%). It should be noted that these data types do not directly translate into specific file formats like images, audio, video, or CSV. Nonetheless, visual data could potentially include images or videos, while acoustic recordings might involve audio files. Satellite tracking data would typically consist of location coordinates and timestamps, which could be stored in various formats, including CSV. Without further context, it isn't possible to definitively determine the exact data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.
