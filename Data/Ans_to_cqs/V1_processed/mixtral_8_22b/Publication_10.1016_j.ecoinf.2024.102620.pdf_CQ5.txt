Based on the given context, it appears that the research paper does not discuss any deep learning pipelines or datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the paper focuses on ecological informatics and uses various datasets related to environmental science. These include the MOD13Q1.006 dataset for NDVI, vegetation type data, DEM data, temperature, precipitation, radiation, road data, GDP data, and population data. Therefore, I cannot provide information about the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline based on this context.
