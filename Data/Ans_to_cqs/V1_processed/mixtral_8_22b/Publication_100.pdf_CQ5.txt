The given context does not provide specific details about the datasets used in the deep learning pipelines mentioned. However, it does mention some common datasets used in deep learning such as ImageNet, which was used by Krizhevsky et al. (2012) for image classification tasks. Additionally, Long et al. (2015) used the Pascal VOC dataset for semantic segmentation tasks. It should be noted that these datasets were not explicitly stated as being used in the deep learning pipelines discussed in the given context. Therefore, without additional information, it cannot be determined what datasets were specifically used in those pipelines.
