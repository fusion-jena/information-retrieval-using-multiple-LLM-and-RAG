Based on the given context, it appears that the authors have utilized various types of machine learning and deep learning models for their studies. However, when specifically focusing on deep learning models, one paper mentions the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This information can be found in the first reference cited:

Heddam, S., Kim, S., Mehr, A.D., Zounemat-Kermani, M., Malik, A., Elbeltagi, A., et al., 2022b. Predicting dissolved oxygen concentration in river using new advanced machines learning: long-short term memory (LSTM) deep learning. In: Computers in Earth and Environmental Sciences. Elsevier, pp. 1â€“20.

Therefore, we can conclude that the type of deep learning model used in this particular pipeline is the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network.
