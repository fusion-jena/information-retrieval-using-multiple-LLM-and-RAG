The text does not provide explicit information about the use of specific techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection for addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions several strategies employed to minimize data bias and improve data quality in a case study involving citizen scientists collecting marine species data. These include:

1. Using a checklist of conspicuous species: By providing a list of species to look for, researchers aim to prevent underreporting of common species and encourage accurate reporting of all observed species.

2. Engaging dive guides as interviewers and curators: To validate species identification and reduce misidentification errors, experienced dive guides are involved in conducting interviews and reviewing submitted data.

3. Post-dive debriefings: Regular post-dive debriefings using a mobile app help embed the interview process into routine dive center operations, ensuring consistent data collection and reducing potential biases.

While these methods do not directly correspond to the mentioned preprocessing techniques for deep learning pipelines, they demonstrate efforts to collect reliable and unbiased data, which is crucial for any subsequent analysis, including machine learning applications.
