The table titled "Table 7 - Land use/land cover classification accuracy using XGBoost" provides several metrics for evaluating the performance of the deep learning model. These include Precision, Recall, F1 score, Overall Accuracy (OA), and Kappa coefficient. Additionally, Table 8 presents similar metrics for evaluating the accuracy of forest types in the study site using XGBoost.

Precision measures the proportion of true positives among all predicted positives. It can be calculated by dividing the number of true positives (TP) by the sum of true positives and false positives (FP): TP / (TP + FP).

Recall measures the proportion of true positives among all actual positives. It can be calculated by dividing the number of true positives (TP) by the sum of true positives and false negatives (FN): TP / (TP + FN).

The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both factors. It can be calculated as: 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall).

Overall Accuracy (OA) represents the percentage of correct predictions out of the total number of instances. It can be calculated by dividing the number of correctly classified points (ncorrect) by the total number of points examined (ntotal): ncorrect / ntotal.

Finally, the Kappa coefficient is a statistical measure that compares observed agreement between two raters with expected agreement by chance. It ranges from -1 to 1, where 1 indicates perfect agreement, 0 indicates no better than random agreement, and negative values indicate poorer than random agreement.
