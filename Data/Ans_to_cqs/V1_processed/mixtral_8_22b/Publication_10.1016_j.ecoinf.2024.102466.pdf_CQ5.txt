The study proposes a dataset consisting of 9717 images of 15 wild bird species obtained from camera traps in China's Northeast Tiger and Leopard National Park. The dataset was utilized to evaluate the performance of eight deep learning algorithms for bird object detection. The paper does not explicitly mention using any standard datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it focuses on creating and utilizing its own custom dataset specifically tailored for wild bird species identification.
