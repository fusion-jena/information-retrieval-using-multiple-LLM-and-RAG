The given context does not explicitly mention any specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it mentions the utilization of the eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model, which is known for its efficiency and accuracy in handling large datasets. XGBoost uses a form of gradient descent optimization during training but is not specifically mentioned as being part of the deep learning pipeline in this context. It should be noted that the context focuses primarily on integrating a hybrid model for predicting forest fire vulnerability with a deep learning model-based approach for forest classification, rather than discussing the specific optimization techniques employed within the deep learning pipeline itself.
