Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be applied to improve its performance and efficiency. These may include:

1. Data Cleaning: Removing or correcting erroneous, missing, or irrelevant data points. In the given context, it might involve removing outliers or handling missing values in the acoustic dataset.

2. Normalization/Scaling: Scaling input features to have similar magnitudes to prevent any feature dominating the others during training. Common techniques include Min-Max scaling, Z-score normalization, or log transformation. For instance, the RMSE and MAE scores could benefit from such transformations if they vary significantly in scale.

3. Feature Engineering: Creating new features from existing ones to help the model learn more effectively. In the case of functional data analysis, this could entail extracting relevant features from the time series data, like frequency components or trends.

4. Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing the dimensionality of the input space to avoid overfitting and improve computational efficiency. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was mentioned in the context as one possible technique for achieving this.

5. Data Augmentation: Generating additional synthetic samples to increase the size of the training set artificially. While not explicitly stated in the context, this could potentially apply to the acoustic dataset by creating modified versions of the original signals.
