The purpose of the deep learning model used by Dimitri Korsch is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, based on the information available, it appears that the model is being used for object detection and classification. Specifically, the model is being applied to detect moths within images and then classify them into their respective species. This is evident from the statement mentioning the training of a ResNet-50 model on cropped bounding box images of detected moths, which resulted in an average accuracy of 89.00% on a held-out test set. Additionally, the authors discuss augmenting the training dataset with images obtained from internet search engines, suggesting that they aim to improve the model's ability to recognize various moth species accurately.
