Unfortunately, the given context does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the type of optimizer employed. However, it does describe some aspects of the deep learning models used in the study. For instance, one of the models mentioned is ResNet, which introduced the concept of residual connections between blocks, allowing for deeper architectures without encountering optimization issues. Nevertheless, details regarding the exact hyperparameters used during the training process are not included in the provided information.
