The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it mentions that the smallest dataset consisted of 3900 images, which suggests some level of diversity in the dataset. Additionally, the choice of the most suitable architecture was based on the best validation accuracy and precision obtained during training, indicating that some form of evaluation was performed to assess the model's performance. Furthermore, the use of Microsoft Azure instances with substantial computational resources implies that the model was developed and tested under robust conditions. Nevertheless, without more detailed information regarding the dataset composition, sampling methods, and validation techniques employed, it is difficult to definitively state what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
