The authors of the article use a combination of data from various databases, including EMODnet, UNEP, and CMEMS, to collect raw data for their study. These databases provide access to different types of environmental data, such as bathymetry, temperature, salinity, chlorophyll-Î±, nitrate, phosphate, Secchi disk depth, wave height, distance from nearest city, distance from nearest river mouth, distance from nearest port, distance to coast, and substrate. Some of these variables are static, while others are temporal, meaning they change over time. The temporal variables also include additional features such as values for each month, along with the yearly minimum, maximum, and average for surface and seabed. Overall, the authors utilize a wide range of publicly available datasets to gather the necessary information for their analysis.
