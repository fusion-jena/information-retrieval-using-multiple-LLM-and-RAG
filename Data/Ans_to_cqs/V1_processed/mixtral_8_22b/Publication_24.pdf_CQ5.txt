The text does not provide specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) used in this study have the capability to process multiple input channels of data, similar to how color images have red, green, and blue channels. In this case, the CNNs processed four spectrograms, each preprocessed using a different normalization strategy. Therefore, while we cannot identify the exact datasets used, we do know that the input data consisted of spectrograms derived from audio files.

Based on the given context, I am unable to determine the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is clear that the pipeline utilized spectrograms derived from audio files as input data.
