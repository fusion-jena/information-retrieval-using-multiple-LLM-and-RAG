The deep learning model used in this study is Faster R-CNN. The training hyperparameters of Faster R-CNN are carefully chosen to achieve accurate identification of pests. The Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer is used with a momentum value of 0.9. The initial value of the learning rate is set to 0.001 and decreases to 0.0004 after 40K steps.
