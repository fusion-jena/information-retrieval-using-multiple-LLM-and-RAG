The text does not explicitly mention which specific deep learning framework was used to build the model. However, it mentions using Darknet, which is an open-source neural network framework written in C and CUDA. It is mainly used for object detection tasks and supports YOLO (You Only Look Once) versions such as YOLOv4 mentioned in the paper. Therefore, we can infer that Darknet was used as the primary framework for building the deep learning model.
