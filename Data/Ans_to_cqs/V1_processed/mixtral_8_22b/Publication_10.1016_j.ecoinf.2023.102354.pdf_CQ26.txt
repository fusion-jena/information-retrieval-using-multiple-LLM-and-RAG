The given context does not provide information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge, several common methods can be applied to mitigate data bias issues:

1. Stratified Splitting: In this method, the dataset is divided into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes in both subsets. This ensures that the model learns from all types of instances equally.

2. Oversampling: When dealing with imbalanced datasets, oversampling involves duplicating samples from the minority class to balance it with the majority class. Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is one popular approach for generating new synthetic examples.

3. Undersampling: Unlike oversampling, undersampling reduces the number of samples in the majority class by randomly removing instances until the desired balance between classes is achieved.

4. Diverse Data Collection: Collecting diverse data helps ensure that the model is exposed to various scenarios and patterns, reducing the risk of overfitting and increasing its ability to generalize better.

These techniques aim to improve the performance of deep learning models by addressing data biases and ensuring fair representation of different classes in the dataset.
