The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps taken before training a deep learning model. However, there are some relevant details about preparing the data for the machine learning process. For instance, the text mentions reducing the number of pixels per scene to 3,757,323 and taking an average of 18 seconds per scene. This could imply some form of image resizing or cropping to optimize computational resources. Additionally, the authors discuss addressing the issue of imbalanced datasets due to iceplant being a minority land cover class. They managed to create a relatively balanced dataset without resorting to techniques like undersampling, oversampling, or generating synthetic data points. Although these aren't traditional preprocessing steps for deep learning models, they do highlight important considerations when dealing with real-world datasets.
