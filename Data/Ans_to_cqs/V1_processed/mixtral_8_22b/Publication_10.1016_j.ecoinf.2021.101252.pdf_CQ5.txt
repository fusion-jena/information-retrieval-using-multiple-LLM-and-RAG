The information provided does not specify which datasets were used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common datasets used in deep learning include MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet. These datasets contain images of handwritten digits, natural scenes, and objects, respectively. Without further context, I cannot determine if these specific datasets were used in the given case studies.
