The context does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (train, test, validation sets). However, generally speaking, the common practice is to randomly divide the available dataset into three subsets: training set, validation set, and testing set. Typically, the ratio used is 60% for the training set, 20% for the validation set, and 20% for the testing set. The training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Lastly, the testing set is used to evaluate the final performance of the model. It should also be noted that when splitting the data, it is important to ensure that each subset has a representative distribution of all classes present in the original dataset.
