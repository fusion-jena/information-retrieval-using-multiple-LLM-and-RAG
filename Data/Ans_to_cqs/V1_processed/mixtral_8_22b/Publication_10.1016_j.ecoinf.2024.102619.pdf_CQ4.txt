The given context does not provide specific information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is common knowledge that some popular data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, and color space transformations. These techniques help improve the generalization ability of models by creating new variations of existing data. It would require additional sources or context to determine which specific techniques were used in this case.
