In the given context, there is no direct reference to specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it does discuss data augmentation as a technique to artificially increase the number of samples in the training set by applying specific deformations on the input images. This method helps overcome limitations when a large labeled training set is not available. Additionally, transfer learning has been mentioned as another approach to help overcome these limitations. These methods do not directly address data bias but rather aim to improve model performance and robustness by increasing the amount of training data. To specifically address data bias, other techniques like those mentioned in the query would need to be employed.
