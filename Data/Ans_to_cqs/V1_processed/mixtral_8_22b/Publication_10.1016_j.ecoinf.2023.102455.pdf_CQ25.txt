The purpose of the deep learning model discussed here is not explicitly stated for a specific task such as classification, segmentation, or detection. However, it can be inferred that the model is designed for time series forecasting, specifically for creating a multi-temporal forecasting model of daily streamflow (Qflow). This is indicated by the use of CNN-BiGRU, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) often employed for sequence prediction tasks, along with other comparative machine learning methods like KELM, RVFL, and CNN-BiRNN. The goal appears to be to develop accurate and reliable models for predicting daily streamflow using these advanced deep learning techniques.
