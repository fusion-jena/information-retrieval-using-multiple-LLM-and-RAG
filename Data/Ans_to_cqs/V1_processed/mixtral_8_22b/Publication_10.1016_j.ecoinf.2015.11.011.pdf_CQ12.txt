The text does not provide information about what specific type of deep learning model was used in the pipeline. It only mentions that machine learning techniques are being combined with segmentation to classify images. However, it does not specify whether this involves convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers, or any other type of deep learning model. Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot determine what type of deep learning model was used in the pipeline.
