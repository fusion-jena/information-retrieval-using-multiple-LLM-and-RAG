Based on the given context, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is primarily images. This is evident from several mentions of images throughout the text, including phrases like "classification of images," "identifying objects within the image," and references to specific techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) which are commonly used for image analysis. Additionally, the mention of "annotated images" further supports this conclusion. However, the context does not provide explicit details about other potential data formats such as audio, video, or CSV files being used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, we can only confirm that images are one of the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.
