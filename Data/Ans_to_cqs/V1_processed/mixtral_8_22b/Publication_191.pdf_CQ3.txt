The given context does not provide information about specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it mentions the use of the Visual Genome dataset [54], which contains densely annotated images with objects, attributes, relationships, and descriptions. These types of annotations could potentially support tasks like object detection, semantic segmentation, and image captioning. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) for plant recognition, which may involve various forms of image annotation depending on the specific task requirements.
