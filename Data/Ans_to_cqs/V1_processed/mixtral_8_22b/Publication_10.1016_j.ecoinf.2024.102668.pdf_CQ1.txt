The study by D. Luna-Naranjo et al. utilizes two types of devices for collecting raw data: SongMeters and AudioMoths. The SongMeters have a sampling rate of either 44.1 or 48 kHz with a gain of 16 dB, while the AudioMoths have a fixed sampling rate of 48 kHz with a medium gain setting. The authors collect 120 hours of audio recordings per site using these devices. They also mention exploring various recorders and selecting an optimal one for specific applications. However, they do not explicitly state whether they use any other methods such as surveys or public datasets for collecting raw data.
