The given context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that one of the primary data formats used is high-resolution images, as mentioned in several sources such as He et al. (2015, 2016), Deng et al. (2009), and Firestone (2020). Additionally, the context mentions the use of ImageNet, which is a dataset containing millions of labeled images. Therefore, we can conclude that high-resolution images are a significant data format used in the deep learning pipeline discussed in the given context.
