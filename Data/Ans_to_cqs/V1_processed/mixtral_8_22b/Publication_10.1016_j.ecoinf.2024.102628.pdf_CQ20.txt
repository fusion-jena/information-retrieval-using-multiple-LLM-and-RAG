The given context does not provide specific details about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that some form of GPU acceleration might have been used due to the nature of deep learning tasks, especially when working with large datasets and complex architectures such as ResNet-34. Additionally, the use of the fast.ai library suggests that the training process may have leveraged GPU capabilities since fast.ai supports both CPU and GPU training. Nevertheless, without explicit mention of the hardware resources used, one cannot definitively state whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware accelerators were employed during the training process.
