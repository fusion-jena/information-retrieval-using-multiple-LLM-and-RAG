Handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline is crucial to ensure reproducibility and consistency in results. One common strategy is fixing the random seed value, which controls the initialization of weights and biases in neural networks, as well as the shuffling of training data. By setting a fixed seed, researchers can reproduce their experiments exactly, making it easier to compare different models or hyperparameters. Another approach is to use deterministic algorithms instead of stochastic ones whenever possible. For instance, using a deterministic optimizer like SGD without momentum instead of Adam can reduce variability in results. Additionally, averaging over multiple runs with different seeds can provide more robust estimates of performance metrics. Finally, documenting all sources of randomness and reporting them alongside experimental results is essential for transparency and replicability.

Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, from general knowledge, one can infer that fixing the random seed value is a commonly used strategy to control randomness in deep learning pipelines. This ensures reproducibility and consistency in results. Other approaches include using deterministic algorithms instead of stochastic ones and averaging over multiple runs with different seeds. Documenting all sources of randomness and reporting them alongside experimental results is also important for transparency and replicability.
