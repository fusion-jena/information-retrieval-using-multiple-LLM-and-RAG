Regularization methods are techniques used in machine learning and deep learning models to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the noise or outliers in the training data instead of generalizing patterns from the entire dataset. Two common regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines are Dropout and L2 Regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps reduce interdependent learning among neurons. This method prevents any single feature from dominating the others and encourages the network to distribute its capacity across all features. During testing, no neurons are dropped, but their outputs are scaled down proportionally to the dropout rate used during training.

L2 Regularization, also known as Ridge Regression or Weight Decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients. By adding this penalty, the model tries to minimize both the error on the training set and the size of the coefficients. As a result, the model becomes more robust against overfitting because smaller coefficient values lead to simpler models that generalize better.

Both Dropout and L2 Regularization can be combined and applied simultaneously to improve the performance of deep learning models. Other regularization methods include L1 Regularization (also called Lasso Regression), Early Stopping, and Data Augmentation. Each method has its strengths and weaknesses, so choosing the appropriate one depends on the specific use case and requirements.
