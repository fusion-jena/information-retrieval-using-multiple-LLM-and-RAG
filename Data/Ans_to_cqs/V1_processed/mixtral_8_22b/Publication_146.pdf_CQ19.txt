The text does not explicitly mention which specific deep learning framework was used to build the model. However, it can be inferred from the reference to the paper "[18]" by Taqi et al. that TensorFlow might have been used since they discuss the use of TensorFlow Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) performance. Additionally, the keyword "YoloV3" indicates that YOLO (You Only Look Once) version 3 was employed for object detection tasks. While YOLO itself is not a deep learning framework, it is often implemented using popular frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, without explicit information, one cannot definitively state whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or another framework was utilized.
