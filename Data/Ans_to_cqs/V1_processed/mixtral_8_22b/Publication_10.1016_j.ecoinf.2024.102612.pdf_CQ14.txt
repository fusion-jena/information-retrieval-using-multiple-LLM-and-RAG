Unfortunately, there isn't enough context provided to determine how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. The given text does not mention any specific methods like grid search or random search for hyperparameter optimization. It mainly focuses on the use of a Deep Learning (DL) model for semantic segmentation of Multi-Spectral (MS) point clouds, creating a ground truth for validation, and applying a decision tree scheme for fuel model retrieval. However, without further details about the training process or the specific techniques employed for tuning the model, we cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the optimization of hyperparameters.
