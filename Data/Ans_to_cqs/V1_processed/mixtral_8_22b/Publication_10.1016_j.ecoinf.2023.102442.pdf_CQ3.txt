Based on the given context, there is no explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that some form of image labeling or classification technique might have been employed due to the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) mentioned in one of the papers. CNNs typically require labeled training data, such as bounding boxes or pixel-level masks for object detection or semantic segmentation tasks. Nevertheless, without further details, it cannot be confirmed what exact data annotation techniques were utilized in this case.
