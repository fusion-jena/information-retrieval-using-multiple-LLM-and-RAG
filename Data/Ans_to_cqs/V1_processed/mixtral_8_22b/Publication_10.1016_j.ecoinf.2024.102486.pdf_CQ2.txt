The provided context does not explicitly mention specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does suggest that some of the research involves image and audio data. For instance, one study uses animal audio classification, while another focuses on recognizing and classifying visual images. Additionally, a reference to the Deep Learning Toolbox by MathWorks implies potential usage of various data formats, including images, videos, and signals. Furthermore, the mention of TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch suggests the possibility of working with different types of data, as these libraries support multiple data formats like images, text, time series, and more. Therefore, while the exact data formats used in the deep learning pipeline cannot be definitively determined from the provided context, it can be inferred that they likely include image and audio data, among others.
