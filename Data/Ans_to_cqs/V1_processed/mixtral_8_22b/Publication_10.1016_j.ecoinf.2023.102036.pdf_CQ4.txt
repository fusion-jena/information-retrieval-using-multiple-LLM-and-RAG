The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include: i) affine transformations (scaling, translation, rotation, and shear); ii) pixel sum transformation; iii) hue, saturation, and contrast modifications; and iv) adding Gaussian noise to images. These techniques help increase the amount of available data and encourage variability within the same class, thereby improving the model's ability to generalize and avoid overfitting.
