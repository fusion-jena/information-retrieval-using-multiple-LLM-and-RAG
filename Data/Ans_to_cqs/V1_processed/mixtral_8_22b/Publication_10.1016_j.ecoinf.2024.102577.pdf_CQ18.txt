The text does not provide explicit information on the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions that a 5 x 10-fold cross-validation was performed for each method and species, which suggests that the authors might have used cross-validation as a technique to evaluate the model performance during training. Cross-validation involves splitting the dataset into several subsets or folds, where one fold is used for testing while the remaining ones are used for training. This process is repeated until every fold serves as the test set once, allowing for a more robust evaluation of the model's performance.
