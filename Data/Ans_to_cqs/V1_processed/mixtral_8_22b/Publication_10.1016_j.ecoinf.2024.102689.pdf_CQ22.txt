The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including Precision, Recall, F1 score, Mean Average Precision (mAP), Frames Per Second (FPS), and Box_loss. Precision represents the proportion of positive samples correctly recognized by the model, while Recall denotes the proportion of all actual positive samples that are correctly recognized. The F1 score is a harmonic mean of Precision and Recall, providing a comprehensive performance measure; higher scores indicate better performance in both precision and recall. mAP calculates the average precision across all categories of recall, serving as a commonly used metric in object detection. FPS measures the real-time performance of the model; higher values indicate faster image processing, making it suitable for real-time applications. Box_loss assesses the accuracy of the modelâ€™s predicted bounding boxes against the actual ones; lower values suggest more accurate predictions.
