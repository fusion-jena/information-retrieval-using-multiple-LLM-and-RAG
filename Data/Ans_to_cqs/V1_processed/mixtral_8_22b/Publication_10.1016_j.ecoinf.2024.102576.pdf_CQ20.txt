Unfortunately, the given context does not provide any explicit information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It only mentions that a deep learning model was trained based on the results of previous steps and that the target PSI can be classified using this trained model. To determine the exact hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, additional information would be required.
