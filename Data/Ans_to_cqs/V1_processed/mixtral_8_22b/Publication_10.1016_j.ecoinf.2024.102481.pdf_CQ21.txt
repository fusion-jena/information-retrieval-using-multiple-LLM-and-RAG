After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the study or project. Some common postprocessing steps include calculating various evaluation metrics such as precision, sensitivity, specificity, prevalence, and Cohen's kappa coefficient. These metrics help assess the performance of the model and its ability to accurately predict the target variable. Additionally, creating a confusion matrix can provide insights into the types of errors made by the model, such as false positives and false negatives. Other postprocessing techniques like saliency maps can be employed to visualize which input features contribute most significantly to the model's output, providing valuable information about feature importance and model interpretability.
