Based on the given context, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves evaluating the mean Average Precision (mAP) scores of various models at different stages of training. The text mentions that the Cascade RCNN model outperformed other models at each training stage, while the FCOS model and Sparse CNN model consistently had lower mAP scores than others. It was observed that almost all models reached the maximum mAP when the number of epochs reached 10, indicating that not all models benefit from longer training times. For instance, the Cascade RCNN model showed little improvement after 9 epochs, while the ATSS and RepPoint models required more training data or a longer training schedule to achieve higher performance. Thus, the strategy appears to involve monitoring the mAP scores of the models throughout the training process and adjusting the training duration accordingly to optimize their performance and conserve computing resources.
