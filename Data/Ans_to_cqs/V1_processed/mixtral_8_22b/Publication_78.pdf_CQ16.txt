The text does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, common criteria used in machine learning include reaching a minimum threshold for accuracy or other performance metrics, achieving a stable validation loss over several epochs, or setting a maximum number of iterations or time limit for training. In this study, it appears that various models were trained using different methods, such as SVM with RBF kernel, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and AdaBoost, but no specific stopping criterion was mentioned. Therefore, without additional information, we cannot definitively state what criteria were used to determine when training was complete in this particular study.
