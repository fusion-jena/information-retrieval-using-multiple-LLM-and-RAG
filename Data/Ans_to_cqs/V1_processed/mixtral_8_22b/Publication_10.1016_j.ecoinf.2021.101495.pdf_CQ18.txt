The text does not provide explicit information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions that manual tuning was employed, suggesting that human intervention played a role in monitoring and adjusting the model's performance during training. Additionally, the use of data augmentation indicates that efforts were made to improve the model's learning process by increasing the diversity of the training data. The mention of the total number of training segments and the duration of training also suggests that some form of tracking or logging occurred during the training process. Nevertheless, without further details, it cannot be definitively stated what specific strategy was used to monitor the model performance during training.
