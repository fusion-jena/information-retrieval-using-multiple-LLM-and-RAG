Unfortunately, there is no information provided about the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, common optimization techniques used in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSprop), and others. These techniques help minimize the cost function during the training process. Without further context or details, it is not possible to determine which optimization techniques were used in this particular case.
