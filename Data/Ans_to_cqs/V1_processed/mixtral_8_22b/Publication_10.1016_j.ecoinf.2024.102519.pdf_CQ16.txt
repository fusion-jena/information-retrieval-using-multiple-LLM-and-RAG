Based on the given information, there isn't a direct mention of the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, typically in machine learning models, some common criteria include reaching a certain number of epochs, achieving a desired level of accuracy, or observing a plateau in the validation loss. In this case, since we do not have explicit details about the model being trained, we cannot provide a definitive answer.
