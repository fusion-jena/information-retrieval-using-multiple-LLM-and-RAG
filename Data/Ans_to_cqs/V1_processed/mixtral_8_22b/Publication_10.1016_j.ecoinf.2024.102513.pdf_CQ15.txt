In the context of deep learning pipelines, including those used for Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) mapping using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), various optimization techniques are employed to minimize the loss function during training. Two commonly used optimization algorithms are Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam).

SGD is an iterative method for optimizing differentiable objective functions, often used in machine learning applications. In this algorithm, the gradient of the cost function is computed for only one or a few samples at a time, rather than the entire dataset. This makes SGD computationally efficient when dealing with large datasets. However, due to its stochastic nature, SGD may exhibit high variance and slower convergence compared to other methods.

On the other hand, Adam is another popular optimization technique that combines the advantages of two other methods: Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp) and momentum-based optimization. Adam maintains individual adaptive learning rates for each parameter, allowing for faster convergence and better performance on noisy gradients. By combining these properties, Adam offers improved stability and efficiency compared to traditional SGD.

Other optimization techniques used in deep learning include RMSProp, AdaGrad, and Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG). These methods differ in their approaches to updating weights and handling noise in the gradients, offering trade-offs between computational complexity, memory requirements, and overall performance. Ultimately, the choice of optimization technique depends on factors such as the specific application, available resources, and desired outcomes.
