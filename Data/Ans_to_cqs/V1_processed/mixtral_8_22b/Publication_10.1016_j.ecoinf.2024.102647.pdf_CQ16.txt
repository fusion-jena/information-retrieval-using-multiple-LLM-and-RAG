The given context does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed for the machine learning models mentioned. However, common criteria used to determine when training is complete include reaching a minimum threshold for accuracy or other performance metrics, achieving a stable validation loss over several epochs, or meeting a predefined number of iterations or epochs. These criteria can vary depending on the model type, dataset size, and desired level of precision. In this case, we cannot definitively state which criteria were used without additional context.
