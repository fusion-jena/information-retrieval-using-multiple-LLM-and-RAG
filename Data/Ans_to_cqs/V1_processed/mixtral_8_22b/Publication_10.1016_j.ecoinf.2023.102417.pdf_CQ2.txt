The text primarily discusses the use of deep learning methods for biocrust classification using RGB image data. It mentions that these images can be obtained relatively inexpensively with standard camera sensors. Therefore, the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is RGB image data. However, the text does not explicitly mention other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV files being used in the deep learning pipeline.
