The text does not provide explicit details about specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrices. However, it mentions two methods used to evaluate the model's performance: coefficient of determination (R^2) and a leave-one-group-out (LOGO) cross-validation strategy. The R^2 value is calculated by comparing the true versus predicted values across all 648 multitemporal transects. Additionally, the LOGO cross-validation involves leaving out one complete 450m multitemporal transect during each iteration of the training process, ensuring that every transect is eventually tested. These approaches help assess the model's performance while considering the constraints of the available data.
