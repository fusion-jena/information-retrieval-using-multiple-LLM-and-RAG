The given context does not provide specific information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or managing random seed values. However, some common strategies used in machine learning and deep learning pipelines include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using deterministic algorithms when possible, and employing techniques such as cross-validation or bootstrapping to account for variability due to random sampling. In the case of neural networks like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are mentioned in the context, one might also consider using pretrained models with fixed weights or ensembling multiple models trained with different initializations to reduce sensitivity to random initialization.
