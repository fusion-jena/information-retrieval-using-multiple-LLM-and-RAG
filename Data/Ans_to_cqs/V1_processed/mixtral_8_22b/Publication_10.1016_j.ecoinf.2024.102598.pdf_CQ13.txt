Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the type of optimizer. However, it is mentioned that the authors utilized the recommended parameters for all Machine Learning Models (MLMs), including the deep learning model if there was any. Furthermore, they explicitly set the number of trees to 500 for the Random Forest (RF) algorithm as an additional parameter. It is also stated that they followed a rigorous validation methodology using a 10-fold cross-validation (CV) design, reserving 30% of the forest fire occurrence data as a validation set and using the remaining 70% to train the model. Nonetheless, without explicit mention of the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, I cannot provide further information based on the given context.
