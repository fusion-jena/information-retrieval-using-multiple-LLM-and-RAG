The evaluation indicators of the deep learning model include several metrics to measure its performance. These metrics are primarily focused on assessing the quality of predictions made by the model. Some of these key metrics are:

1. Testing Accuracy: This metric measures how often the model makes correct predictions when presented with new, unseen data. It is calculated as the ratio of the total number of accurate predictions to the total number of input samples.

2. Precision: Also known as Positive Predictive Value, it calculates the proportion of true positive predictions among all predicted positives. High precision indicates fewer false positives.

3. Recall or Sensitivity: This metric evaluates the ability of the model to identify true positives correctly. It is computed as the fraction of relevant instances that were retrieved over the total amount of relevant instances.

4. Specificity: This metric quantifies the capability of the model to accurately predict negative outcomes. It is determined as the ratio of true negatives to the sum of true negatives and false positives.

5. F1 Score: This is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single value that balances both metrics. It ranges from 0 to 1, where higher values indicate better performance.

6. Inference Time: This refers to the duration required for the model to process a given input and generate an output. Lower inference times suggest faster processing capabilities.

These metrics help researchers understand the strengths and weaknesses of their deep learning models, enabling them to fine-tune and optimize their designs accordingly.
