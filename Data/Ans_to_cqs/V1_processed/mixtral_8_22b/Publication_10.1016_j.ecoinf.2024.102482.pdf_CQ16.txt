Unfortunately, the given context does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete for this particular model. However, based on common machine learning practices, some potential criteria could include reaching a certain number of epochs or iterations, achieving a desired level of accuracy or loss on the validation dataset, or observing no significant improvement in validation performance over several epochs (i.e., a validation loss plateau). Without further details, I cannot definitively state which criterion was used for this specific model.
