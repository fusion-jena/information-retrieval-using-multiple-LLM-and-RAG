The given context does not provide information about the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, some common techniques used to handle data bias include stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified sampling is a method where the dataset is divided into different subsets or strata based on certain criteria such as class labels. The samples from these strata are then selected randomly to create a representative sample set. This technique ensures that all categories are represented fairly in the training and testing datasets.

Oversampling involves increasing the number of instances in the minority class by duplicating existing examples or creating synthetic ones. This can help balance the dataset and reduce bias towards the majority class. Undersampling, on the other hand, involves reducing the number of instances in the majority class to achieve a more balanced dataset. Both oversampling and undersampling have their advantages and disadvantages, depending on the nature of the problem being addressed.

Diverse data collection involves collecting data from various sources and ensuring that it represents the true diversity of the population being studied. This can help mitigate any biases introduced by using only one source of data.

In summary, there are several techniques available to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. These include stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Each technique has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of which technique to use depends on the specific requirements of the problem being solved.
