Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any specific optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, we do see that the Faster R-CNN model uses a loss function L (Equation 1) for training the regressor and classifier. This loss function consists of two parts: classification loss (Lcls) and regression loss (Lreg). These losses help optimize the weights during the training process, but the exact optimization algorithm used is not specified. Therefore, without further information, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the optimization techniques employed in the deep learning pipeline.
