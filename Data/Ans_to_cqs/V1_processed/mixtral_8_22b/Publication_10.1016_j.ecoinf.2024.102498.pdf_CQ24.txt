The text does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some common strategies used in machine learning and deep learning pipelines include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, employing cross-validation techniques, and utilizing ensemble methods to reduce variance caused by randomness. Setting fixed seeds ensures consistent results across multiple runs, while cross-validation helps evaluate model performance and generalizability. Ensemble methods combine multiple models to improve overall performance and robustness against randomness.
