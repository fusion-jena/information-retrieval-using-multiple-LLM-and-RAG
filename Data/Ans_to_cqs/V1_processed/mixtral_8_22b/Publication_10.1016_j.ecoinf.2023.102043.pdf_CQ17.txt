Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be assumed that some form of regularization might have been implemented during the training phase of the YAMNet model or while fine-tuning the final layers of the network for the specific task of goat vocalization detection. Regularization techniques such as dropout, L1 regularization, or L2 regularization could potentially be used to mitigate overfitting. Dropout randomly sets a fraction rate of input units to 0 at each update during training time, helping to prevent complex co-adaptations on training data. On the other hand, L1 and L2 regularization add penalties to the loss function, encouraging simpler models and reducing overfitting. Without further information about the implementation details, it cannot be confirmed if these or any other regularization methods were indeed utilized.
