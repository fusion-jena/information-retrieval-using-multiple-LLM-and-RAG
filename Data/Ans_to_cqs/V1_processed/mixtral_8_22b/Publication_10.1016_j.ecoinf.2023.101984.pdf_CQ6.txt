Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be taken to improve its performance. These may include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing or correcting erroneous data points such as missing values, outliers, or inconsistent entries. It also includes handling categorical variables if any.

2. Normalization or Standardization: Deep learning models often perform better when input features have similar scales. Therefore, it's common practice to rescale features into a specific range (normalization) or to have zero mean and unit variance (standardization).

3. Feature Scaling: Similar to normalization, feature scaling resizes all features so they fall within a smaller specified range, typically between 0 and 1.

4. Encoding Categorical Variables: If there are categorical variables in the dataset, these need to be converted into numerical form. One popular method is one-hot encoding.

5. Dimensionality Reduction: In cases where the number of features is very large, dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can be used to reduce the complexity of the model without losing too much information.

6. Train-Test Split: Before training the model, the dataset should be divided into two parts - a training set and a testing set. The model learns from the training set, while the testing set is used to evaluate how well the model has learned.

7. Cross Validation: To ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data, cross validation can be performed. This involves splitting the data into multiple folds, training the model on different combinations of these folds, and then averaging the results.
