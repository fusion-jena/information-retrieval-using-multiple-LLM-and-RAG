The given context does not provide explicit information about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, based on common practices in machine learning and deep learning, several techniques can be employed to mitigate data bias. These include stratified splitting, which ensures that each subset of the data maintains the same distribution of classes or labels as the overall dataset. Oversampling is another technique where minority class examples are duplicated to create a more balanced dataset. Undersampling involves removing samples from the majority class to achieve a similar effect. Lastly, diverse data collection aims to gather data from multiple sources or populations to reduce bias and improve the model's performance on unseen data.
