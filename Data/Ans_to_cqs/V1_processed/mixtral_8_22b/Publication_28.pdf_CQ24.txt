The strategy employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the random seed value, is called the "reparameterization trick". This method involves transferring the sampling to the input layer instead of having a stochastic unit within the networks. By applying this technique, the model samples from a normal distribution with zero mean and identity variance, denoted as N(0, I). Then, the sampled value is used to calculate the output of the model, where μ(x) and θ(x) represent the mean and covariance of the latent variable z given the input x. This approach allows for more stable optimization during training and reduces the impact of randomness caused by the initial seed values.
