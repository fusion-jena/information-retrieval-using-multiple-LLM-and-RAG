Based on the given information, there is no mention of any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. Therefore, it cannot be determined what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.

However, some common methods used to improve the generalizability of deep learning models include using diverse datasets, cross-validation, stratified splitting, regularization techniques, early stopping, and transfer learning. These methods help prevent overfitting and improve the performance of the model on unseen data. Without more information about the specific deep learning model being referred to, it is not possible to provide a detailed answer regarding the measures taken to ensure its generalizability.
