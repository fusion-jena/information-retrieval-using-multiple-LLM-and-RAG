The text does not explicitly mention the specific format of the data used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the data is likely in a structured format such as CSV or similar, given that it involves multivariate inputs and outputs. This is further supported by the fact that the input tensor during training consists of three dimensions: batch size, the number of model variables, and the future prediction length. Furthermore, the text mentions that the input and output dimensions of the encoder and decoder are set to the number of variables in the dataset, suggesting that the data is tabular rather than images, videos, or audio files. Therefore, while the exact format is not specified, it is reasonable to assume that the data used in the deep learning pipeline is in a structured format like CSV.
