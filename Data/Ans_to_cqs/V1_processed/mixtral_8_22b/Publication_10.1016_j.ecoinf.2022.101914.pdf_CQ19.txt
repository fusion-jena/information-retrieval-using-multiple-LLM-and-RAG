The text does not provide information on which specific frameworks or libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch are used to build the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the biomod2 package in R is used to build all models, including those based on machine learning methods like Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Maximum Entropy software (MaxEnt). Therefore, it appears that the models are developed within the R programming environment using the biomod2 package.
