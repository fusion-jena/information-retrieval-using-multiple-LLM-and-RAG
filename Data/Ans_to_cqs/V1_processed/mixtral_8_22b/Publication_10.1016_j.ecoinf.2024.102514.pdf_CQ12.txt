Based on the given context, it appears that the paper titled "Analysis of input set characteristics and variances on k-fold cross validation for a recurrent neural network model on waste disposal rate estimation" by Vu, H.L., Ng, K.T.W., Richter, A., and An, C. uses a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model in their study. However, there is no information about the use of any other types of deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Transformers in the provided context. Therefore, we can only confirm that an RNN model was used in one of the papers mentioned in the context.
