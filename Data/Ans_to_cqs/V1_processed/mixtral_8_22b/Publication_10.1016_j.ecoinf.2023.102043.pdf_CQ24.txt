Based on the provided context, there isn't any explicit information about specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some implicit strategies can be inferred from the described processes.

In the context of collecting background noise samples using the SensorTile, randomness is introduced by generating 10 RAND events per day, each lasting 5 seconds. These events serve as opportunities to record ambient sounds. To avoid interference with significant sound events, the RAND events are discarded when the envelope 'e' exceeds a certain threshold while a RAND event is in progress. This approach ensures that only non-significant background noise is recorded during these randomly generated intervals.

Regarding the detection of goat vocalizations, the recording campaign lasted an entire year to capture seasonal variations in goat vocalization patterns. Over this period, approximately 10 million sound events were collected, totaling over 34,000 hours of recordings. Although not explicitly mentioned, it can be assumed that the dataset was divided into training, validation, and testing sets for developing and evaluating machine learning models. Random sampling techniques could have been used to create these subsets, ensuring that they represent the overall dataset's characteristics.

Lastly, the context mentions the use of an SQL database to store annotations related to various event types, including periodic, sporadic, and unpredictable events. For recurring and human-driven events, automated entries are created in the digital version of farm records. In contrast, unpredictable instances need to be manually added after the fact. While this process does not directly relate to handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it highlights the importance of accurately labeling and organizing datasets to ensure reliable model performance.

In conclusion, based on the provided context, the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline primarily involve controlling the collection of background noise samples and creating representative subsets of the large dataset gathered throughout the year.
