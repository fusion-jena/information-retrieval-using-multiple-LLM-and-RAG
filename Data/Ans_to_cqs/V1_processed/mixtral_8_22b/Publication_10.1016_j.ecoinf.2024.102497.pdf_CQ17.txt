In the given context, there is no direct mention of regularization methods used specifically in deep learning pipelines like dropout or L2 regularization. However, some general strategies to prevent overfitting are discussed.

For instance, in the case of the Classification And Regression Tree (CART) model, certain parameters such as'max_depth','min_samples_leaf', and'max_leaf_nodes' are fine-tuned to prevent overfitting and minimize cross-validation error. Similarly, for the Random Forest Regression (RFR) model, the number of estimators ('n_estimators') can be adjusted to control the complexity of the model and avoid overfitting.

While these methods do not directly correspond to dropout or L2 regularization, they serve a similar purpose in controlling the model's complexity and preventing overfitting. Dropout is a regularization technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to make the model more robust and prevents overfitting. On the other hand, L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, encouraging smaller weights and thus simpler models.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly discuss dropout or L2 regularization, it does highlight the importance of controlling model complexity to prevent overfitting, which aligns with the principles behind these regularization methods.
