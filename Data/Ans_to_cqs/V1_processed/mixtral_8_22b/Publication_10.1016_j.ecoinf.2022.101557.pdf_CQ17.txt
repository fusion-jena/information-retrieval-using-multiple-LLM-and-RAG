The text mentions that dropout is used as a regularization method to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to make the model more stable and prevents it from relying too heavily on any single feature. Additionally, the use of ADAM optimization with a learning rate of 0.0001 can also help to prevent overfitting by controlling the magnitude of weight updates during training. However, there is no mention of other regularization techniques such as L2 regularization being used in this particular case.
