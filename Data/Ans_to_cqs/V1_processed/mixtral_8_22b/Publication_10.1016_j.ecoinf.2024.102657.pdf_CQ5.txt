The text does not provide explicit details about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the goal was to demonstrate the power of human-machine teaming with minimal preprocessing. It also states that the CNN used ResNet-18, a well-known 18-layer CNN architecture, and that the input data consisted of spectrograms generated from bird songs. These spectrograms were then resized to fit the required dimensions for ResNet-18. Therefore, while the exact names of the datasets are not mentioned, it can be inferred that the datasets used in this case were custom datasets consisting of bird song spectrograms.
