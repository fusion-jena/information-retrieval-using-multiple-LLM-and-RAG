The data is typically split into three subsets for deep learning model training: training data (At and Bt), validation data (Av), and testing data (T). The training data is used to fit the parameters of the model, while the validation data is used to tune the hyperparameters of the model. The testing data is used to evaluate the final performance of the model. The splitting ratio between these datasets may vary depending on the specific application and dataset size, but common ratios include 80/10/10 or 70/15/15 for training/validation/testing respectively. It is important to ensure that the splits are representative of the overall distribution of the data and that they do not introduce any bias into the model. Additionally, cross-validation techniques such as k-fold cross-validation can also be employed to further improve the robustness and generalizability of the model.
