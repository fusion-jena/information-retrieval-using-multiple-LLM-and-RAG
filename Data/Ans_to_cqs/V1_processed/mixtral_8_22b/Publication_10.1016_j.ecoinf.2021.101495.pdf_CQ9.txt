The paper does not provide information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that the ground truth validation uses data from four fishing sets, which are either from official sources or estimations. However, there is no mention of any specific data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I do not have enough information to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
