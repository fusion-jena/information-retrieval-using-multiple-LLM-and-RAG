The article does not provide information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that they used a modified version of the U-Net architecture for semantic segmentation and trained it using the optimizer RMSprop with an initial learning rate of 0.0001. They also mention that they trained their network for 300 epochs with 24 images per batch. However, there is no reference to any specific code repository or platform where the code for this implementation is publicly available.
