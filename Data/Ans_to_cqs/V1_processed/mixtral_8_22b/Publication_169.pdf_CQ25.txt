The purpose of the deep learning model described in this paper is for classification. Specifically, the model aims to classify images of plant species into one of 100 different categories. This is achieved through the use of a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) units. The CNN layers are responsible for extracting features from the input images, while the LSTM layer is used to analyze temporal information and aid in the final classification task. The output layer of the model uses a softmax activation function to produce probabilities for each of the 100 possible classes. Overall, the goal of this model is to accurately identify and categorize various plant species based on their visual characteristics.
