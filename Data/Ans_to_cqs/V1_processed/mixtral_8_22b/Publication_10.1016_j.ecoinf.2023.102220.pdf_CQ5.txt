The given context does not explicitly mention any specific dataset used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, we can infer that the authors have employed various machine learning techniques including Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and other methods like Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, etc. They have mentioned using the ReLU activation function for hidden layers and sigmoid activation function for the output layer in their DNN architecture. Additionally, they have utilized LSTM by incorporating a long short term memory block into their DNN structure.

Although the context doesn't specify which datasets were used, common datasets often employed in deep learning pipelines include MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet. These datasets consist of images and corresponding labels, making them suitable for tasks involving image classification or object recognition. Nevertheless, without explicit details about the datasets used in this particular study, one cannot definitively determine if these commonly used datasets were part of their deep learning pipeline.
