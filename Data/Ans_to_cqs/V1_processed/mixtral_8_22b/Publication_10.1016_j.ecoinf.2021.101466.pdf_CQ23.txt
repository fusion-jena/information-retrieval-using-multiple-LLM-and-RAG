To ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model, the authors took several measures. They used diverse datasets, which included different types of EfficientNet models ranging from B0 to B7. These models were scaled up based on capacity over various benchmark datasets using a compound scaling method that enlarged the network depth, width, and resolution. Additionally, they proposed a data augmentation method to train the two-stage Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), aiming to create a generally applicable model under various camera or field conditions. This approach likely helped improve the robustness and adaptability of the model across different scenarios. However, it is not explicitly stated whether techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting were employed during the development process.
