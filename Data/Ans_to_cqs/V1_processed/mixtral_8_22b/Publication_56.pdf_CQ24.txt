Based on the given context, it appears that the focus of the research is on using deep learning methods, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, for classifying land use in the context of the European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). However, the context does not provide any specific details about how randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the random seed value, was handled. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer to your query based solely on the given context.

However, generally speaking, there are several strategies that can be employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline:

1. Fixed Random Seeds: One common approach is to set a fixed random seed value before running experiments. This ensures that the same initial conditions are used each time, making the results reproducible.

2. Multiple Runs: Another strategy is to run the experiment multiple times with different random seeds and then average the results. This helps to reduce the impact of any single random initialization.

3. Cross-Validation: Using cross-validation can also help to reduce the impact of randomness. By splitting the dataset into multiple folds and averaging the results across all folds, the variance due to randomness can be reduced.

4. Regularization Techniques: Regularization techniques like dropout or weight decay can also help to reduce the impact of randomness by preventing overfitting to the training data.
