In the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization being used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss a common partial remedy to address overfitting - the use of validation data. Validation data is set aside during the training phase but its annotations by the models are monitored. By tracking the performance on the validation dataset, one can determine when to stop training to avoid overfitting. In this particular study, they used 30 epochs per training task based on their validation runs. While this method helps mitigate overfitting, it doesn't directly refer to techniques like dropout or L2 regularization.
