The text mentions that the highest Mean Intersection over Union (MIoU) value is used to determine the point at which the Deep Neural Network (DNN) attains optimal performance. After training the selected SoftGroup architecture over 1000 epochs for each type of input data, metrics like MIoU or Mean Accuracy (MA) are computed after each epoch to analyze the training performance. Once trained, the configuration weights that achieve the best classification performance are selected to establish the reference trained model. Therefore, it can be inferred that the criterion used to determine when training is complete is achieving the highest MIoU value during the training process.
