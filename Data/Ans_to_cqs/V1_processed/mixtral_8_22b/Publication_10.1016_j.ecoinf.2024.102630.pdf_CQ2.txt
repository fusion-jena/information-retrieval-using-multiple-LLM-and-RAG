The study uses several types of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) datasets, including the 16-day synthesized MOD13Q1 V6 NDVI dataset (MODIS NDVI), the daily NOAA Climate Data Record (CDR) of AVHRR NDVI V5 dataset (CDR AVHRR NDVI), and the third generation GIMMS NDVI from AVHRR sensors dataset (GIMMS NDVI). These datasets are sourced from the Google Earth Engine platform. Additionally, the study also utilizes SPOT/VEGETATION products (SPOT NDVI), administrative divisions, and DEM datasets from the Resource and Environmental Data Center of the Western Sichuan alpine plateau region (WS), the Southwest Sichuan mountainous area (SS), and the Sichuan Basin (SB). Therefore, the primary data format used in this study is satellite imagery or raster data.
