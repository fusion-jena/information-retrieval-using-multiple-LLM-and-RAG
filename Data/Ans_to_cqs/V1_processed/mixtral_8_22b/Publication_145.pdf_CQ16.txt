The text does not explicitly state the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions that the network was trained for 300 epochs with a batch size of 24 images. This suggests that the number of epochs or iterations could be one criterion used to decide when to stop training. Additionally, since the model uses the optimizer RMSprop, which is an adaptive learning rate method, it might also consider changes in the learning rate or convergence of the learning process as indicators for stopping training. Unfortunately, there is no explicit mention of using validation loss plateau as a criterion for determining when training should be stopped.
