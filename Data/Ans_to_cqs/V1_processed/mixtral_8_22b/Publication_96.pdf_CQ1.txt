In the given context, the authors used remotely sensed data from Landsat 8 imagery consisting of eleven spectral bands with varying spatial resolutions. They specifically chose Landsat 8 over Landsat-7 due to data gaps observed in images acquired after 2003. Additionally, they accessed graphics processing units (GPUs) and specialized hardware components through the Google Cloud suite of cloud platforms to conduct their analysis. Fire hotspot data was also obtained from the National Institute for Space Research (INPE) website. Therefore, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in this deep learning pipeline include satellite imagery, publicly accessible databases, and cloud computing resources.
