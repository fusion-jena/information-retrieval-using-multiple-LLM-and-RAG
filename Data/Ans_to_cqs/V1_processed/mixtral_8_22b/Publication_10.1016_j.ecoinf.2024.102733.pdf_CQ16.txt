The text does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does indicate that during the training of the MLP, a scheduler is used that adjusts the learning rate when the network reaches a plateau. This suggests that one possible criterion for determining when training is complete could be based on observing a plateau in the validation loss. When the validation loss stops improving or starts increasing, it may indicate that the model has started overfitting the training data and further training would not improve the model's generalization ability. Therefore, reaching a plateau in the validation loss could serve as a signal to stop training.
