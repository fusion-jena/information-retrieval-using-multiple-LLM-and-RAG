The given context does not provide specific details about the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that Random Erasing Data Augmentation has been used in some studies (Zhong et al., 2020). This technique involves randomly selecting a rectangle region in an image and erasing its pixels with random values. Other common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, and color jittering. These methods help increase the diversity of the training data and improve the generalization ability of the model.
