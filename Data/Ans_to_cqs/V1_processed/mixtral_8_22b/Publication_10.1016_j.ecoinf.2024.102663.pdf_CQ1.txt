The text does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the given context, we can infer that the primary source of raw data is likely underwater video footage or images of fish in their natural habitat. These visual data sources would enable the application of image processing techniques like object detection and segmentation, which are mentioned as part of the deep learning pipeline for estimating fish biomass. Additionally, the reference to large datasets of fish images suggests that publicly available datasets may also contribute to the raw data collection process. Nonetheless, further details regarding the specific methods employed for gathering raw data, such as utilizing specialized sensors or conducting surveys, remain undisclosed in the provided context.
