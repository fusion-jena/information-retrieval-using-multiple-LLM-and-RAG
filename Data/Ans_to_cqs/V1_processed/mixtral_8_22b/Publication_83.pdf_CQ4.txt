Based on the given context, there are two main data augmentation techniques mentioned for handling multi-variate varying length acoustic data in the deep learning pipeline. However, these techniques do not include traditional image processing techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Instead, they focus on adjusting the duration and size of the audio files to fit the requirements of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

The first technique involves repeating the signal from the beginning to force a fixed duration of 2 seconds. This method has been used in previous research and is shown to achieve higher accuracy compared to the second method.

The second technique involves directly resizing the audio image to a fixed size. While this method is simpler, it may result in the loss of some acoustic patterns, leading to lower classification accuracy.

These techniques are specifically designed for handling varying length audio data and are not applicable to other types of data such as images or text. It is important to note that the choice of data augmentation technique depends on the nature of the data and the specific requirements of the deep learning model being used.
