The text does not provide explicit information on the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that manual classification of fuel types was used in semantic segmentation training and testing, which suggests that some form of image labeling or pixel-level annotation might have been applied. Semantic segmentation involves assigning a class label to every pixel in an image, so this process would require detailed annotations. Additionally, the text discusses a multi-class semantic segmentation problem with 10 classes, further supporting the likelihood of pixel-wise annotations. Unfortunately, without more specific details about the annotation methods used, I cannot definitively state whether bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, or other techniques were utilized.
