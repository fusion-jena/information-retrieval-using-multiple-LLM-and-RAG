The provided context does not directly address the specific strategies used to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, particularly regarding random seed values. However, it mentions several studies using deep learning algorithms in various fields, including strategic planning, ecosystem service value, food supply and demand, environmental challenges, teacher self-efficacy, and more.

Randomness in deep learning pipelines can be handled through various methods, although these are not explicitly mentioned in the given context. Some common techniques include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, employing ensemble methods to reduce variance, or utilizing deterministic algorithms where possible. Additionally, researchers may choose to report results over multiple runs with different initializations to account for variability due to randomness.

To summarize, while the provided context does not offer direct answers to handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, some general strategies include fixing seeds, using ensemble methods, opting for deterministic algorithms when feasible, and reporting results over multiple runs.
