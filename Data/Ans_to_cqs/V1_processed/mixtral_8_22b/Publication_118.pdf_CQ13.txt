Based on the given information, there is no mention of the specific hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model. However, some details about the architecture of the autoencoder are provided. The autoencoder uses a 128x128x3 input layer and four convolutional layers with 3x3 pixel kernels, a stride of 1 pixel, and zero padding of 1 pixel on each layer except the first one. Additionally, four max-pooling layers are employed with 4x4 pixel kernels, a stride of 2 pixels, and zero padding of 1 pixel. The encoder's output is flattened into a 384x1x1 feature vector. The decoder network takes this feature vector as input and comprises four convolutional layers with a 3x3 kernel, a stride of 1 pixel, and zero padding of 1 pixel on each layer except the last one. Four max-unpooling layers are also utilized with 4x4 pixel kernels, a stride of 2 pixels, and zero padding of 1 pixel, resulting in a 128x128x3 output. Furthermore, a ReLU activation function is applied to aid in addressing the vanishing/exploding gradient problem.
