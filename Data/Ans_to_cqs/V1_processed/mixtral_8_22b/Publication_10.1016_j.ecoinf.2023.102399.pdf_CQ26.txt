The context does not provide explicit information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge, some common techniques include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same proportion of classes or labels in each set. This ensures that the model learns from a representative sample of the entire dataset.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to balance datasets with imbalanced classes. Oversampling increases the number of instances in the minority class by duplicating existing samples or creating synthetic ones. Undersampling reduces the number of instances in the majority class by randomly removing samples or selecting only those that contribute most to the model's performance.

Diverse data collection aims to gather a wide range of examples representing different scenarios, conditions, and variations. This helps prevent overfitting and improves the model's ability to generalize well to new, unseen data.
