The paper does not provide information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the IUC-NN algorithm was implemented as an R package called IUCNN, which is available at <https://github.com/azizka/IUCNN>. This might be helpful if you are looking for more details regarding the implementation of the deep learning model. Unfortunately, there is no explicit mention of a specific data repository link containing the dataset used for training and testing the deep learning pipeline.
