The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps after the model training such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices. However, it can be inferred that there might have been some postprocessing steps based on the information given.

For instance, the text mentions exploring the latent space (Section 5.6), which suggests that there may have been some form of analysis or visualization performed on the learned representations. Furthermore, the discussion about selecting the number of clusters (Section 5.4) implies that some sort of clustering algorithm was applied to group the data points in the latent space.

Additionally, the context discusses improving the clustering performance by including an additional loss component (Eq. (9)) and adjusting the contribution from the classification loss (â„’cls). These modifications suggest that the authors evaluated the model using certain metrics related to its clustering performance.

However, without further details regarding the exact postprocessing steps taken, it is difficult to provide a comprehensive list of all the possible techniques used. Therefore, I cannot definitively state what specific postprocessing steps were involved after the model training.
