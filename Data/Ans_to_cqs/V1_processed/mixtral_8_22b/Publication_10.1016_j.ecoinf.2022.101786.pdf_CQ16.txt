The text does not explicitly state the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions that there is an optimal number of iterations before the performance on the validation and training sets starts to diverge due to overfitting. This suggests that monitoring the performance on both the training and validation sets during each iteration might be a way to identify the optimal point for stopping the training process. Additionally, the mention of validation loss plateau in the query implies that this could potentially be another criterion for determining when training should stop. In general, common criteria for stopping neural network training include reaching a predefined maximum number of iterations, achieving a desired level of performance on a validation set, or observing no significant improvement in performance after a certain number of iterations.
