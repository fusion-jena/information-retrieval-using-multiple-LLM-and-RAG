Unfortunately, there isn't any explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training in the provided context. However, based on common practices in machine learning, one could infer that possible postprocessing steps might include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics such as accuracy or F1 score, creating confusion matrices, or performing other forms of analysis to evaluate the performance of the model. These steps would typically be used to assess how well the model generalizes to unseen data and to identify areas where the model may need improvement.
