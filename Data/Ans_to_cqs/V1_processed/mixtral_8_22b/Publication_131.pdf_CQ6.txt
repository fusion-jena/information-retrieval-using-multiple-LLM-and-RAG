The text does not provide explicit information about specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it mentions a crucial step called data augmentation, which is a technique used to increase the amount of training data by creating modified versions of the existing data. In this case, for each of the 865 audio samples in the database, ten additional audios were generated through various transformations like time stretching, pitch shifting, and adding noise. These transformations were then reflected in the mel-spectrogram images used for training the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Additionally, the text discusses the use of a balanced sampling approach for selecting test sets to improve the generalization of the machine learning model and prevent overfitting.
