The text does not provide explicit details about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some indications that suggest certain practices might have been employed. For instance, the mention of using the ImageNet dataset for pretraining suggests that the model was exposed to diverse visual data before being fine-tuned on plant-specific data. This could potentially improve its ability to generalize across different types of plants. Additionally, the fact that the model has been trained on over 2.9 million images covering 30,261 species implies that the dataset used for training was quite extensive and varied, further enhancing the likelihood of good generalization performance. Lastly, while not explicitly stated, it is common practice in machine learning to employ techniques like cross-validation or stratified sampling during model development to prevent overfitting and enhance generalizability. Therefore, although not directly mentioned, it is plausible that similar strategies may have been adopted here as well.
