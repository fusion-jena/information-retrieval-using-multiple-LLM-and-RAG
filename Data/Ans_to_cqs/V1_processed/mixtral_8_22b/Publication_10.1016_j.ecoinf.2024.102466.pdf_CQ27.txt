The article does not provide specific information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning models used for bird object detection. It focuses mainly on evaluating the performance of various deep learning algorithms based on a dataset containing images of wild bird species obtained through camera traps in China's Northeast Tiger and Leopard National Park. To determine the best approach for deploying the trained models, one would need additional details regarding the chosen platform, hardware requirements, and any necessary preprocessing steps before applying the models to new datasets.
