The paper does not provide explicit information about the specific methods or tools used for collecting raw data in their deep learning pipeline. However, based on the general process described in the paper, it can be inferred that they likely use bioacoustic recordings from various sources such as field surveys or publicly available datasets. These recordings are then processed and analyzed using machine learning techniques like deep neural networks to identify and classify bird species. It is also mentioned that they create multiple subsets of recordings with varying amounts of cases, suggesting that they may have collected a diverse range of audio samples for their analysis.
