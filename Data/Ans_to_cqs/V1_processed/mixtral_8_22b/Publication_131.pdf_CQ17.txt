The text does not provide explicit information about specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization being used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that a balanced sampling was carried out for the test set to enhance the generalization of the machine learning model and prevent overfitting. Additionally, the use of data augmentation techniques can also be considered as a form of regularization to improve the model's performance and reduce overfitting.
