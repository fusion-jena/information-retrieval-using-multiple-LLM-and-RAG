The given context does not provide specific details about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, generally speaking, common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, translation, and noise injection. These techniques help increase the amount of training data available, improve model robustness, and prevent overfitting. For instance, image flipping involves creating new images by horizontally or vertically flipping existing ones. Rotation entails rotating images by a certain degree, while scaling adjusts the size of images. Cropping involves removing parts of an image, and translation shifts the position of objects within an image. Lastly, noise injection adds random noise to input features to enhance model generalization.
