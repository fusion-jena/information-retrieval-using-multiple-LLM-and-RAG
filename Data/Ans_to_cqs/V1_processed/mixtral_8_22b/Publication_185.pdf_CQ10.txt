Unfortunately, based on the given information, there is no explicit mention or reference to any specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in this study. Therefore, I cannot provide the exact link to the GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repositories related to this research. However, considering that the authors mentioned using Caffe (Jia et al., 2014) for implementing their deep learning model, you may want to explore the official Caffe repository for more details about its implementation and usage: https://github.com/BVLC/caffe
