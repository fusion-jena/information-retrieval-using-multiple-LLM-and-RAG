The text does not provide explicit information about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the methods used to demonstrate the utility of the data models were chosen for their applicability to a range of data types, allowing comparison across different input datasets. This suggests that diverse datasets might have been used to improve the model's performance and generalization capabilities. Additionally, the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN), autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks (GAN) indicates that advanced techniques were employed to learn complex patterns within the data. While there is no direct mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting, these techniques could potentially have been applied during the training process to enhance the model's robustness and prevent overfitting.
