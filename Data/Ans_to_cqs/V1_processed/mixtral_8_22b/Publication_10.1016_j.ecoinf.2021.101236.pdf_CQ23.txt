To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the overall process followed current best practices in deep learning, as outlined in Chollet (2017), ensuring that the model adheres to established standards. Secondly, efforts were made to diversify the training data. This is crucial because diverse datasets help prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to perform well on unseen data. Additionally, the use of a 3-second window length enabled the implementation of a data augmentation method, further enhancing the diversity of the training data. Data augmentation techniques can significantly increase the amount of available training data and improve the model's performance on new data. Lastly, while there isn't explicit mention of using cross-validation or stratified splitting, these methods could have been employed during the development phase to evaluate the model's performance and fine-tune its parameters. However, without specific information regarding their usage, it cannot be confirmed if they were part of the measures taken to ensure the model's generalizability.
