After the model training, several postprocessing steps are mentioned in the given context. These include inspecting the outputs of the model, analyzing the effects of the model and its configurations, and adjusting the configurations or switching to another model type based on the observations. This process is part of the iterative modeling process called the Bayesian workflow, described by Gelman et al. (Gelman et al., 2020).

To evaluate the model performance during the feature selection phase, candidate logistic regression and random forest models were assessed using both random cross-validation (CV) and spatial CV (Roberts et al., 2017). In spatial CV, the full training dataset was divided into spatial blocks, as depicted in Figure 2. Since the model performance estimation through spatial CV depends on the spatial arrangement of the CV folds, the procedure was carried out over 100 random blocking configurations.

Additionally, the workflow results included visualizations and scores presented in Figures 3, 4, and B.11, along with discussions and analyses found within the text. These interpretations focused on understanding the scores and visualizations, as well as identifying potential issues, if present. However, specific details regarding saliency maps, metrics calculations, confusion matrices, or other explicit postprocessing techniques are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
