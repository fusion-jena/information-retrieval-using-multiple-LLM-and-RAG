Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into sets like train, test, or validation. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to use a random stratified sampling method to divide the dataset into these subsets. Typically, the dataset is divided into three parts: training, testing, and validation. The training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set helps tune hyperparameters during the training process. Lastly, the test set evaluates the final model's performance after training and tuning. Common ratios for splitting datasets include 70/15/15 or 80/10/10 for training, validation, and testing respectively.
