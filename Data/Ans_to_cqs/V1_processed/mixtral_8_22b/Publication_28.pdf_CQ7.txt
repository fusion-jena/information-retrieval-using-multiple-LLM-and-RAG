Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to divide datasets into these subsets for various purposes. Typically, the dataset is divided into three parts:

1. Training set: This subset is used to train the model, i.e., adjusting its parameters to minimize the error between predicted and actual outputs. Usually, this comprises around 60-80% of the total dataset.

2. Test set: After training the model, it needs to be evaluated on unseen data to assess its performance. This evaluation is done using the test set, which typically consists of about 20-30% of the total dataset. It should be noted that the test set must remain completely separate from the training process to ensure accurate evaluation.

3. Validation set: Sometimes, a third subset called the validation set is also created during the training phase. Its purpose is to fine-tune hyperparameters or select the best performing model among multiple trained ones. The validation set usually makes up around 10-20% of the total dataset.

In summary, while the exact criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not mentioned in the given context, typical practices involve dividing the dataset into training, testing, and sometimes validation sets. These divisions help improve the model's accuracy, generalization, and overall performance.
