The text does not provide explicit information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it mentions that the authors used the Python-based open-source library "fastai" version 1 for training the deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN). This suggests that the code might be based on or related to the FastAI library. Unfortunately, without further information, I cannot determine the exact location of the code repository. It could potentially be hosted on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket, but this remains speculative until confirmed by additional sources or documentation.
