Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data augmentation techniques used in image processing include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, and changing brightness or contrast. These techniques help increase the size and diversity of the dataset, improving the performance and generalization ability of the model. It is possible that some of these techniques were employed but not explicitly mentioned in the text.

Unhelpful 
I am unable to provide information about the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline because it was not specified in the given context.
