The deep learning model used in this study is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The hyperparameters specified for this ANN include the learning rate, the number of nodes in a single hidden layer, and the maximum number of training epochs. The optimal number of nodes in the hidden layer was determined through a trial-and-error method, varying between 5 and 23. The learning rate was also adjusted using the same method, ranging from 0.01 to 1.0 in increments of 0.05. The final ANN structure consisted of five input variables with one node accounting for bias, 19 hidden neurons with one node accounting for bias, a 0.7 learning rate, and one output variable of the output layer. An early stopping technique was employed to prevent overfitting, where the dataset was divided into 80% for model training and 20% for model testing.
