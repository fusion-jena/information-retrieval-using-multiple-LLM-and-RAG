Unfortunately, the provided context does not contain information about specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, I can provide some general insights regarding data annotation techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines.

Data annotation involves labeling raw data to help train machine learning models. Some common data annotation techniques include:

1. Bounding Box Annotation: This technique involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects within images or videos to identify their location. It is widely used in object detection tasks.

2. Semantic Segmentation: This technique involves assigning labels to every pixel in an image, allowing the model to understand the overall scene better. It is useful for applications like autonomous driving and medical imaging.

3. Instance Segmentation: Similar to semantic segmentation, instance segmentation involves identifying individual instances of objects within an image. Each distinct object receives its own unique label.

4. Polygon Annotation: This technique involves manually outlining complex shapes using polygons. It is particularly helpful for irregularly shaped objects.

5. Landmark/Key Point Annotation: This technique involves marking specific points on an object to define its structure or shape. It is frequently used in facial recognition systems.

6. Text Annotation: This technique involves adding textual descriptions or tags to images, audio clips, or video files. It helps improve search functionality and content organization.
