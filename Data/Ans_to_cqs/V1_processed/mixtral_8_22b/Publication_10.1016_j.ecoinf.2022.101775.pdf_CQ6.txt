The text mentions that the authors manually removed the testing set from the dataset before training the algorithms. Additionally, they used a min-max scaler to scale the data, which was then reverted at the end to compute performance metrics on the test set. These are examples of preprocessing steps taken before training a deep learning model. Normalization or scaling is often applied to ensure that different features have similar scales, preventing any feature from dominating the others due to its larger numerical values. Cleaning the data may involve handling missing values, outliers, or incorrect entries. Although the text does not explicitly mention these specific steps, they are common practices when preparing datasets for machine learning tasks.
