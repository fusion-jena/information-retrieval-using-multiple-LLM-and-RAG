The papers cited do not provide information about the optimization of hyperparameters for any specific model. The focus of these studies appears to be on analyzing the impact of human activities and climate change on vegetation growth using remote sensing data and various indices such as growing season NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). Therefore, it is not possible to determine how the hyperparameters of a particular model were optimized based solely on this context.
