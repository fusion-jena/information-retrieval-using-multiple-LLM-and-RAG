The text does not provide information about the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of a convolutional neural network for automatic recognition of woody regrowth vegetation in repeat landscape photographs. Regularization methods such as dropout and L2 regularization are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting. Dropout involves randomly dropping out neurons during training to reduce co-dependencies between them, while L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function to discourage large weights. Other regularization techniques include early stopping, data augmentation, and batch normalization. These methods help to improve the model's ability to generalize to new data and avoid overfitting to the training set.
