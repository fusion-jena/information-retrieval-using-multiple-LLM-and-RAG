The pipeline uses a type of convolutional neural network (CNN) called the U-Net model for its deep learning tasks. The U-Net model is specifically employed for image classification purposes within this pipeline. It operates via supervised learning, being trained on both training and validation datasets before performing classification based on those datasets.
