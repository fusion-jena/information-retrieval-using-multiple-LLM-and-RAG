The paper does not provide explicit information on the specific method used for collecting raw data in their deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions using honey bee flight activity data, suggesting that they might have employed sensors or monitoring devices to gather this information. Unfortunately, without more detailed information from the authors, we cannot definitively state the exact method used for data collection.
