The provided context does not directly mention any specific evaluation metrics used for evaluating the performance of a deep learning model. However, common evaluation metrics used for such models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, and confusion matrix. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions made. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made. Recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positives. The F1 score combines both precision and recall into one metric. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve plots the True Positive Rate against the False Positive Rate, while the Confusion Matrix provides a visual representation of the predicted vs actual values.
