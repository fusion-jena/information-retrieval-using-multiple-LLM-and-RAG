The text does not provide explicit information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions using a list of cropped thumbnails and their labels, which suggests that image or video data was collected and preprocessed before being fed into the deep learning model. Additionally, the mention of a 'learning database' implies that some form of dataset was used for training the model. Unfortunately, without more specific details, it cannot be determined whether these datasets were obtained through surveys, sensors, public datasets, or other means.
