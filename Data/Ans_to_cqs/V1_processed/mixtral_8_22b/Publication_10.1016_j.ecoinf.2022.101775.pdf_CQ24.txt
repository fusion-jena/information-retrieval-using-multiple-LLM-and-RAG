The text does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, including managing random seed values. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning pipelines to use techniques like setting fixed seeds or using deterministic algorithms to ensure reproducibility and consistency across experiments. This helps mitigate the effects of randomness introduced by various components, such as weight initialization, shuffling training examples, or dropout regularization. Additionally, cross-validation and ensemble methods can also help reduce variance caused by randomness.
