The paper does not provide information about the specific code repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in their study. However, it mentions that they have made their work available as open source software, so it can be assumed that the code repository would likely be found on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. To find the exact link, readers may need to search for the authors' names or the name of the project ("BatDetect") on these platforms or contact the authors directly for more information.
