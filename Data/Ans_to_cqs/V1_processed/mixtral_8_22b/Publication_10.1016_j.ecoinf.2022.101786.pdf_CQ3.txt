The text provides information about the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image analysis but does not explicitly mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that bounding box annotation was employed based on the description of how the model evaluations were conducted.

In the model evaluation section, it is mentioned that the testing dataset consisted of 500 manually annotated images. These manual annotations were then compared with the CNN predictions. Predictions came as a JSON file containing the coordinates of the bounding box of each tentative annotation along with a confidence score.

To evaluate the performance of the CNN, a custom R script was used to spatially match CNN predictions and manual annotations. A tentative annotation was considered a true positive if its center was within a 30-pixel distance from a manual annotation center in the same image. This indicates that bounding box annotation was utilized during the data annotation process.

While the text does not provide explicit details regarding other data annotation techniques such as instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, or polygon annotation, it focuses primarily on the application of CNNs for image analysis and the evaluation of their performance using bounding box annotations.
