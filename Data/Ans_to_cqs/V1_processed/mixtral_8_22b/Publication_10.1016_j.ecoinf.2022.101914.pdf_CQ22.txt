The study uses two primary metrics to evaluate the performance of their models: the True Skill Statistic (TSS) and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve (AUC-ROC). These metrics are used to calculate the performance of both individual modeling approaches and the final ensemble models. The True Skill Statistic is based on a binary classification of model points, while the AUC-ROC measures how well a model can distinguish between classes. Additionally, sensitivity and specificity are also mentioned as part of the comparison when choosing the best performing model. However, traditional machine learning metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall are not explicitly stated in the given context.
