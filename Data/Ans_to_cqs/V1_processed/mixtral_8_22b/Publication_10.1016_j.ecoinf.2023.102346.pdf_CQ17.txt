The authors do not explicitly mention any specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in their deep learning pipeline. However, they discuss using various machine learning algorithms such as GLM, SVM, MARS, RF, FDA, CART, GBM, and MAXENT for generating predictive models. These algorithms may have built-in mechanisms or can be combined with techniques like dropout or L2 regularization to avoid overfitting. For instance, L2 regularization can be applied to penalize large weights in linear regression models like GLM, while dropout can be employed in neural network architectures like those found in some implementations of RF, GBM, or other ensemble methods. Nevertheless, without further details about the exact implementation of these algorithms, it is impossible to definitively state which regularization methods were utilized by the authors.
