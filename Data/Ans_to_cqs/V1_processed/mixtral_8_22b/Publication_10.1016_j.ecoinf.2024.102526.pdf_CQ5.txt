The given context does not provide specific details on the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions various metadata fields related to image acquisition, processing, and curation, which suggests that the authors might have used their own dataset or a combination of publicly available datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Without explicit mention of these datasets, we cannot confirm their use in this particular case.

Based on the context, the focus seems to be more on capturing and managing image data rather than using predefined datasets for training deep learning models. The metadata fields cover aspects such as image orientation, illumination, scale reference, practical constraints, datetime, longitude, latitude, depth, ground level, pixel per millimeter, square meter area, curation protocol, QAQC, and ancillary data. These fields suggest that the authors were working with custom image datasets, possibly collected through satellite or aerial imagery.

In conclusion, while the context does not explicitly state the use of popular deep learning datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, it implies that the authors may have utilized their own custom datasets tailored to their research objectives.
