Based on the provided context, no specific technique is mentioned to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some general practices can be identified. For instance, the use of stratified splitting is implied by mentioning the 'ideal train-test split'. This method ensures that both the training and test datasets have roughly the same distribution of classes, thus reducing potential biases caused by class imbalance. Additionally, the context mentions the availability of diverse data, such as single-tree point clouds, images of single trees, and CSV files containing various attributes. This suggests that diverse data collection could also help mitigate data bias. Nevertheless, explicit methods like oversampling, undersampling, or SMOTE are not discussed in the provided context.
