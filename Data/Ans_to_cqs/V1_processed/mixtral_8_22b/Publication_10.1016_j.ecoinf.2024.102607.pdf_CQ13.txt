The given context does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in any deep learning models. Instead, it discusses various sampling techniques such as undersampling, minor category oversampling, and combinations of oversampling and undersampling to handle imbalanced training data in Random Forest (RF)-based Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) mapping. It also mentions the use of machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Decision Trees (DTs), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), and Random Forests (RFs) in LULC mapping. Among these, RF is highlighted as having lower sensitivity to tuning parameters and better robustness against noise. However, no details regarding the hyperparameters used in these models are mentioned.
