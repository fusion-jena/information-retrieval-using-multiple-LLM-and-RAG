The given context does not provide explicit details about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation datasets. However, based on common practices in machine learning and deep learning, some possible criteria could include:

1. Random Splitting: Data is randomly divided into three subsets - training set, validation set, and test set. Typically, the ratio used is 60:20:20 or 70:15:15.

2. Stratified Splitting: When dealing with imbalanced classes, stratified sampling ensures that the distribution of target variables remains consistent across different subsets.

3. Time-series Splitting: For temporal data, splitting should be done sequentially rather than randomly to maintain the chronological order.

4. Cross-Validation: K-Fold cross-validation is often used to evaluate the model's performance and prevent overfitting. It involves dividing the data into k equal folds, where one fold serves as the test set, and the remaining k-1 folds form the training set. This process is repeated k times, ensuring every fold gets a chance to act as the test set.

Without explicit mention in the provided context, it cannot be definitively stated which criteria were used for splitting the data for deep learning model training.
