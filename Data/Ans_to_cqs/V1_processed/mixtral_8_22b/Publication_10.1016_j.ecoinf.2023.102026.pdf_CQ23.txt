The text does not provide information on specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, it mentions several factors that could influence the scale of species distribution models, including bootstrapping, using a generalized linear model, machine learning techniques like random forests, multi-scale analysis, and considering various taxonomic levels such as species, genera, and families. Additionally, the study examines models across different spatial scales ranging from 1000m to 10,000m and considers multiple algorithms. These aspects suggest that the authors may have considered diverse datasets and methods to improve the robustness and applicability of their models. Nevertheless, without explicit mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting, one cannot definitively state whether these specific techniques were employed to enhance the generalizability of the deep learning model.
