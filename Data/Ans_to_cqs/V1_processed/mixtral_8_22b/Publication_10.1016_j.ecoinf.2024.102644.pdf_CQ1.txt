The study utilizes both publicly available datasets and direct observations for collecting raw data. Specifically, it uses data from GBIF, which is a public authoritative repository of big data. Additionally, the researchers improve this dataset by incorporating their own reliable records obtained through accurate and direct observations made in the field. This approach ensures a comprehensive and robust dataset for analysis. Furthermore, the study mentions plans for a new data census and collection campaign using other public FAIR data repositories such as those from the Tuscany Region administration and Copernicus. However, these additional data sources may require more sophisticated data harmonization strategies due to potentially coarser spatial resolutions compared to the initial dataset.
