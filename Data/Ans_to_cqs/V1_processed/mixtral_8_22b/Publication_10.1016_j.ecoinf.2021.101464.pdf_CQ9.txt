The given context does not provide information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that big data theory and technology, neural networks, structural equations, and other deep-level data mining methods are used for understanding the impact of climate differences on selected variables and the overall prediction ability of relevant models. However, it does not specify any particular data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I do not have enough information to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
