The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, there are several clues suggesting that the authors use image data. For instance, they discuss the limitation of having a small number of labeled images in each category, indicating that their dataset likely contains images. Furthermore, they refer to the application of deep learning methods in identifying animal species based on photographs, implying that their model uses visual input. Therefore, while not directly stated, it can be inferred that the authors employ image data in their deep learning pipeline.
