Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide a direct link to the data repository containing the deep learning pipeline. However, the article mentions two popular object detection models, YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN, which have been applied to identify invasive Pacific oysters using drones and remote sensing techniques. These models are open source and their code repositories can be found online. For instance, YOLOv5 can be accessed via GitHub (<https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5>) and Faster R-CNN can be found in TensorFlow's Object Detection API (<https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection>). It is possible that the authors might have shared their customized versions or modifications of these models along with their dataset in a public repository like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF, but without additional information, it cannot be confirmed.
