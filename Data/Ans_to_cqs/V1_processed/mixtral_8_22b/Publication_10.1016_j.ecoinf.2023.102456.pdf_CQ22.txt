The text mentions several metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. These include accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrices. The use of confusion matrices provides detailed information about both correct and incorrect classifications made by the model, enabling the identification of potential deficiencies in classifying specific classes or categories. Additionally, the false positive (FP) and false negative (FN) percentages are considered to measure how well the model fits. These metrics help understand the percentage of hits the model achieves for each class. Other metrics mentioned include balanced accuracy (B. Acc), F-measure Fβ, Cohen’s kappa coefficient k, and Matthew’s correlation coefficient (MCC). These alternative measures give a more comprehensive and accurate picture of the model's performance, which is crucial for proper evaluation.
