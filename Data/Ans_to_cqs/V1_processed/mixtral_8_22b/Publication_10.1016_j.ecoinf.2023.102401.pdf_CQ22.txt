The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, recall, F1 score, Precision-Recall (PR) curve, and average mean accuracy. Among these, the Mean Average Precision (mAp) is considered the primary metric for evaluating the model's effectiveness. It provides a thorough measure of the impact of accuracy and recall across all categories. The mAp is calculated as the average AP of all n categories. Other commonly used metrics include precision, recall, and F1 score, which are derived from True Positives (TP), False Positives (FP), True Negatives (TN), and False Negatives (FN). These metrics help assess the model's ability to accurately classify objects or detect anomalies in data.
