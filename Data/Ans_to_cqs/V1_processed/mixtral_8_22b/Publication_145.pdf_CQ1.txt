The text does not provide explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of remote sensing techniques and very high-resolution images, which suggests that satellite or airborne sensors might be employed for gathering such data. Additionally, the study focuses on mapping individual tree species in tropical forests, implying that field surveys could also play a role in acquiring ground truth data for training and validating the models. Nevertheless, without further details, we cannot definitively state what exact methods are being used for data collection in this particular case.
