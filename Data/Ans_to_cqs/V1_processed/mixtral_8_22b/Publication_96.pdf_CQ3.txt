In the given context, no explicit mention of data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline is made. However, from the information provided about the study, we can infer that the researchers might have used pixel-wise labeling or semantic segmentation as their data annotation technique. This assumption comes from the fact that they were working on classifying and mapping burned areas using Landsat 8 imagery, which consists of multiple spectral bands. Pixel-wise labeling involves assigning labels to each individual pixel in an image, making it suitable for multi-class problems like land cover classification. Semantic segmentation also fits this scenario since it aims to classify every single pixel into a category, providing more detailed information about the scene. Nevertheless, without further clarification from the authors regarding the exact data annotation techniques employed, these assumptions remain speculative.
