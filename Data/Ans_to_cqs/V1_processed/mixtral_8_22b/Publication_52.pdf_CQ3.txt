The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it discusses various aspects related to deep learning models like Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Deep Extreme Learning Machine (DELM). These models are often employed for tasks involving image classification, object recognition, and speech recognition. In these scenarios, data annotation techniques like bounding box annotation and instance segmentation might be utilized during the dataset preparation phase before feeding the data into the deep learning models. Nevertheless, without explicit information about the data annotation techniques mentioned in the context, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the specific techniques used in this case.
