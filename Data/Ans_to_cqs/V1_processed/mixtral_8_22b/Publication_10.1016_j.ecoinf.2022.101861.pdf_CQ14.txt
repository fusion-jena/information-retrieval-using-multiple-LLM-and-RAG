The text does not provide specific details on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the authors used Kaleidoscope software to extract sounds from audio files using certain signal parameters such as minimum frequency, maximum frequency, and maximum inter-syllable gap. However, it does not mention any specific method for optimizing these parameters, such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a helpful answer to this query.
