The text does not contain information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or any mention of random seeds. Therefore, it is impossible to provide an accurate response based solely on this context. However, some common strategies used to manage randomness in deep learning pipelines include setting fixed random seeds, using deterministic algorithms where possible, and employing techniques such as cross-validation and ensemble methods to reduce variability caused by random initialization or data splits.
