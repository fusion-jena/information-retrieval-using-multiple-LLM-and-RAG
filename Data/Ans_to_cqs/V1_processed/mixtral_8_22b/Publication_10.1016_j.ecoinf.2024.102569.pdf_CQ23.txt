Based on the given context, it appears that the authors utilized a technique called Root Trimmed Mean Squared Prediction Error (RTMSPE) to improve the generalizability of their deep learning model. This approach helps in selecting appropriate values for tuning parameters, thereby reducing the impact of heterogeneous observations. By using this method, the authors aimed to minimize the effect of outliers and extreme observations, which can negatively affect the performance of machine learning models. However, the context does not explicitly mention other commonly used techniques like diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, based solely on the provided information, we cannot confirm if these specific methods were employed to enhance the generalizability of the deep learning model.
