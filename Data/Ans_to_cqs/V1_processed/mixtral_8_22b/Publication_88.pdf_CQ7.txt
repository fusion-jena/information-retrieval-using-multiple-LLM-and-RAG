The data was split into training, validation, and test sets for both the Amazon and Cerrado databases. However, the specific criteria used to split the data are not explicitly stated in the given context. It can be inferred that the splitting was done based on different tiles or regions, as shown in Tables 1 and 2. Each table lists the available deforestation and non-deforestation samples for various tiles in the respective datasets. Furthermore, it appears that the number of training samples was varied across multiple scenarios, ranging from using one tile to four tiles for training purposes. This suggests that the dataset was divided based on spatial distribution rather than random sampling.
