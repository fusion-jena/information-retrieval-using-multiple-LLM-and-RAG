During the cross-validation process, three metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. These metrics include testing accuracy, MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and AUC (Area Under Curve). The best model for each set of variables was selected based on its performance across these three metrics. In cases where there were small discrepancies among the metrics, the model with the highest AUC was chosen.
