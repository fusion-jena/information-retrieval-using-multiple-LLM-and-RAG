Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide a direct link to the deep learning pipeline data repository. However, based on the given context, it appears that the authors are using Google Earth Engine (GEE), which is a cloud-based platform providing access to various satellite imagery datasets such as MODIS and CMAP. Additionally, they mention using Landsat satellite datasets for investigating water surface area and salinity variations. While these resources are mentioned, no specific links or references to a deep learning pipeline data repository are provided in the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct link to the requested resource.
