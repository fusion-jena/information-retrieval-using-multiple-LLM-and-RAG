While the given context does not explicitly mention specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization, it does discuss a technique used to address class imbalance, which is another common cause of overfitting in deep learning models. Data augmentation was employed to improve the representation of underrepresented classes, thereby enhancing the overall accuracy of the networks.

Regularization methods like dropout and L2 regularization aim to prevent overfitting by adding constraints to the learning process. Dropout randomly sets a fraction of input units to zero during training, effectively preventing complex co-adaptations among neurons. On the other hand, L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, discouraging large weights and promoting simpler models. These methods help reduce overfitting by making the model more robust and generalizable to unseen data.

Although the text doesn't provide explicit information about the use of dropout or L2 regularization, they are commonly used regularization methods in deep learning pipelines to combat overfitting.
