Data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline include bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and labeling. Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest within images. Instance segmentation is similar but provides more precise pixel-wise delineation of each object. Semantic segmentation assigns class labels to every pixel in an image. Polygon annotation involves creating polygonal shapes around objects of interest. Key point annotation involves marking specific points on objects of interest. Labeling involves adding text descriptions or tags to images. These techniques help create labeled datasets required for training deep learning models. However, it should be noted that the paper does not explicitly mention any specific data annotation technique used in its research.

Based on the given context, I cannot provide information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the mentioned study since it focuses on developing machine learning models for estimating net growth in Atlantic Forest fragments using various factors such as forest attributes, land use history, landscape, soil, and climatic characteristics. The paper discusses Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Random Forests (RF), which are machine learning algorithms, but there is no explicit mention of any data annotation techniques used in their research.
