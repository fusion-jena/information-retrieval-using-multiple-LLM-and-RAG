The text does not provide explicit information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, such as using a grid search or random search method. However, it mentions that the number of random regression trees (ntree) was tested from 20 to 100 trees, which suggests some form of parameter tuning. Additionally, the number of division variables (mtry) was set to use one-third of the independent variables by default. Lastly, the minimum size of nodes (node size) was assigned a fixed value of 5. These details indicate that the authors likely employed a manual or empirical approach to adjust these hyperparameters rather than relying on automated optimization methods like grid search or random search.
