Based on the given context, the performance of the machine learning models, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and Random Forests (RFs), was evaluated using several metrics such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), correlation coefficient (r), and Bias. These metrics help assess the quality of predictions made by the models. However, it should be noted that the specific evaluation metrics mentioned here are not typically associated with deep learning models but rather with regression tasks. For evaluating deep learning models, common metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for classification tasks, while mean squared error or mean absolute error can be used for regression tasks.
