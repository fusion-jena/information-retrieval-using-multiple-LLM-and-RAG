The purpose of the deep learning model is primarily for object detection and classification based on feature extraction. These models autonomously extract meaningful features from raw data, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering, particularly in hyperspectral image analyses. They can capture low-level details as well. Specifically, the deep learning model aims to achieve more than 50% classification accuracy under certain conditions such as VGG19 + 8band\_256\_8bit, VGG19 + 72band\_256\_8bit, ResNet50 + 8band\_256\_8bit, and ResNet50 + 36band\_256\_8bit. However, there is no regularity in the classification accuracy. Additionally, the model uses the VGG19 network architecture and incorporates a residual unit involving a short-circuit mechanism to overcome issues like gradient disappearance and accuracy reduction in deep networks.
