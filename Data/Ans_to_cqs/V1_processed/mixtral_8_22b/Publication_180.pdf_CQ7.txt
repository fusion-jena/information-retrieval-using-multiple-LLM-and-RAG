The authors used a leave-one-out cross-validation approach for evaluating the classifier due to the limited number of photographs available for some species. This means that they left out 'n' images, or one image from among the 'n' species in that country, with which to evaluate the model. They also adjusted two parameters from their default values: validation percentage and number of training steps. The validation percentage was increased from 10% to 16% because of the small number of images available for some species. For the number of training steps, they explored different numbers and compared the results to find the optimal balance between computing time and classification efficiency. However, the exact method used to split the data into training, testing, and validation sets is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
