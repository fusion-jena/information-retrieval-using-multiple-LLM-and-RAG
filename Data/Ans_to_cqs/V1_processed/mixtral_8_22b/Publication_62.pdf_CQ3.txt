The paper does not explicitly mention any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is common practice in deep learning applications involving images to use various forms of annotations such as bounding boxes, semantic segmentation, or instance segmentation. These techniques help in localizing objects within an image and providing additional information about them. In this case, since the authors have developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying images, it is likely that some form of labeling was performed on the input images to indicate their corresponding classes. Without further details from the authors, we cannot confirm which specific technique(s) were employed.

I am sorry, I do not have enough information to determine the exact data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline described in the given context.
