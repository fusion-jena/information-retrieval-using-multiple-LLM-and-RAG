Based on the given context, it does not provide specific information about the purpose of the deep learning model used in the study. However, considering the topic of the paper, which focuses on assessing water quality using machine learning approaches, one can infer that the deep learning model might be used for tasks such as classification, regression, or anomaly detection related to water quality parameters. To determine the exact purpose of the deep learning model, additional information would be required.
