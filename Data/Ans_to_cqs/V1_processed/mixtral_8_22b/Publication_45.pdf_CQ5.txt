The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it focuses on using deep neural networks (DNNs) for ecological prediction, specifically addressing bark beetle outbreaks in conifer forests. In this case, the dataset would likely consist of relevant ecological variables related to the study area and the target phenomenon (bark beetle outbreaks). To train and evaluate the performance of the DNN, the authors suggest splitting the available data into a training dataset (for model fitting) and a test dataset (to assess its predictive capabilities).
