Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any deep learning model or its associated hyperparameters like learning rate or optimizer. Instead, the text discusses a Random Forest model, which is a type of ensemble learning method rather than a deep learning technique. In this case, the hyperparameters mentioned are specific to the Random Forest model, including 'ntree', 'nodesize', and'mtry'. Here, 'ntree' refers to the number of trees in the forest, set to 500 in this instance. 'Nodesize' is the minimum size of terminal nodes in the trees, which is set to 5. Lastly,'mtry' represents the number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split, calculated as the floor of the total number of predictors divided by three, resulting in a value of 1 in this scenario since there are five predictors. Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot provide details about the hyperparameters of a deep learning model.
