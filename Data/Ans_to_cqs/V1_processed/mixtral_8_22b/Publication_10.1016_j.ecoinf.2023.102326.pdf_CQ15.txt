The text does not mention any specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it discusses the application of complex network measures, specifically the Average Shortest Path Length (ASPL), to study networks. It also mentions the use of bootstrapping methods to calculate confidence intervals for ASPL values. These concepts are related to machine learning but do not directly address the query about optimization techniques in deep learning pipelines.
