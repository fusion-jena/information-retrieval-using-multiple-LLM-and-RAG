Based on the given context, it does not provide specific details about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that various remote sensing data types like optical imaging, LiDAR, and RADAR were used in estimating Above Ground Biomass (AGB). Specifically, optical remote sensing data from platforms such as Landsat, MODIS, SPOT, IKONOS, QuickBird, Sentinel-1 & 2, and Worldview were mentioned. These datasets offer different spatial and spectral resolutions. Additionally, Landsat data, particularly over the last two decades, have been extensively employed for AGB estimation. Therefore, while the exact dataset names used in the deep learning pipeline are not specified, we can infer that various remote sensing datasets were utilized for AGB estimation.
