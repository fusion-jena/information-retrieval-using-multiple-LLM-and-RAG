The provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it can be inferred from the information given that one strategy used by the TPEBO algorithm is to begin with an exploratory phase of random searches for feasible hyperparameter configurations. This initial step allows the algorithm to consider various possibilities before focusing on specific areas of the search space. Additionally, the use of a black-box function approach enables a direct link between hyperparameter sets and the network's optimization goals, potentially reducing the impact of randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Nonetheless, further research or additional context would be required to provide a definitive answer regarding specific strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
