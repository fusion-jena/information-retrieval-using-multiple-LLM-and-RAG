The text does not provide specific details on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, common techniques include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets based on class labels or characteristics to ensure each subset maintains the same distribution as the original dataset. Oversampling increases the number of instances in minority classes by duplicating existing samples or generating synthetic ones. Undersampling reduces the number of instances in majority classes by randomly removing samples or selecting those closest to the decision boundary. Diverse data collection aims to gather a wide range of examples representing different scenarios, conditions, and populations to minimize biases caused by limited or skewed datasets. These methods can help improve model performance and generalization by reducing overfitting and increasing robustness against outliers and noise.

Based on the given context, it cannot be determined if any of these techniques were applied during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, further information would be required to accurately answer the query.
