The given text does not provide explicit information on specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, scaling, etc., used within the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses how deep learning techniques like CNNs and RNNs have been employed for Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) mapping and classification. The use of these techniques suggests that some form of data preprocessing and augmentation might have taken place to improve the model's performance. Data augmentation methods help increase the size of training datasets and prevent overfitting by creating modified versions of existing samples. While the exact techniques used remain unspecified, common practices include image transformations like flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, and shifting. In conclusion, based on the available information, we cannot definitively state which data augmentation techniques were applied in the deep learning pipeline; however, it is reasonable to assume that standard image transformation techniques could have been implemented.
