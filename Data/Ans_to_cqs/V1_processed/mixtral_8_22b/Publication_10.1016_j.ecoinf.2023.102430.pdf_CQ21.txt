The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, based on common practices in machine learning, some possible postprocessing steps could include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics such as accuracy or precision, creating confusion matrices, or performing cross-validation. These techniques help evaluate the performance of the models and identify areas for improvement. It is important to note that the actual postprocessing steps may vary depending on the specific requirements and goals of the project.
