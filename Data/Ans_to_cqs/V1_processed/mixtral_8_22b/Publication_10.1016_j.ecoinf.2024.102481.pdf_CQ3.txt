I apologize, but the given context does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it discusses the application of machine learning, specifically Random Forest (RF) method, in classifying reproductive condition in fish, particularly Chilean hake. The RF method uses extensive data from Chilean hake gonads, which were randomly collected from commercial industrial and acoustic surveys. These gonads were then classified into three categories: immature, mature-active, and mature-inactive. The RF classifier demonstrated high precision when compared to the gold standard of histological staging, especially in distinguishing between immature and mature-inactive females, where macroscopic analysis often failed due to the similar external characteristics of the gonads.
