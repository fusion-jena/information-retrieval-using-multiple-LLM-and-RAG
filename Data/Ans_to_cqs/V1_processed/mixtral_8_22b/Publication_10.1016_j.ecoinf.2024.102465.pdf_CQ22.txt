Based on the given context, it appears that the study uses a combination of LSTM-CNN-based sentiment analysis framework for determining the sentiment index and HRNet model for semantic segmentation processing. However, there is no explicit mention of specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of these deep learning models. Typically, common evaluation metrics for such tasks include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, etc. But without more information, I cannot provide a definitive list of metrics used in this particular study.
