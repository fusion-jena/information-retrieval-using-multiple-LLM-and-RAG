The study utilizes GF-6 (WFV) data obtained from the China Centre for Resources Satellite Data and Application. This data is then subjected to various preprocessing steps such as radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction, geometric correction, and image cropping. However, the specific method used for acquiring this satellite data is not explicitly mentioned within the given context. It can be assumed that these data collection methods involve using specialized equipment or software designed to capture and process satellite imagery.
