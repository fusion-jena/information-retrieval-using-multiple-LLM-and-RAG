Handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline is crucial to ensure reproducibility and consistency in results. One commonly used strategy is fixing the random seed value. By setting a specific seed value, the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers will be generated each time the code is executed, ensuring consistent results. This can be done using functions like numpy.random.seed() or tensorflow.random.set_seed(). Another strategy is to save and load pretrained models instead of training them from scratch every time. This eliminates the variability introduced by different initializations and training sequences. Additionally, techniques such as k-fold cross-validation and ensemble methods can also help reduce the impact of randomness on model performance.
