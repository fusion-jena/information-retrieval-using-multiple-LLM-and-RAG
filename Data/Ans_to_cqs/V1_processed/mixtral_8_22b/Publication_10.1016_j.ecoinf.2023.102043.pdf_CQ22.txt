Based on the given context, it appears that the performance of the deep learning model, specifically the YAMNet-based classifier, is evaluated using a confusion matrix. This matrix provides insights into the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative rates of the model. However, the context does not explicitly mention specific metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall. Nevertheless, these metrics can be derived from the values in the confusion matrix. For instance, accuracy can be calculated as the sum of true positives and true negatives divided by the total number of instances. Precision can be computed as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives. Recall, also known as sensitivity, can be determined as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives. Therefore, while the context does not directly state the use of these metrics, they can still be inferred from the information provided.
