The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it can be inferred that the researchers utilized machine learning experiments based on a dataset generated over 11 days, which included six organoleptic parameters applied to seven fish species. This information suggests that some form of data labeling or annotation was performed to create this dataset, but the exact technique remains unspecified within the provided context.
