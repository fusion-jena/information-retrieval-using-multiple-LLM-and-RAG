The provided context does not directly address the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that segmentation and classification strategies in eCognition are rapidly evolving, and that machine learning techniques are being combined with segmentation to improve automatic image classification. The text also emphasizes the importance of supervision and validation using other data sources, suggesting that these processes might play a role in determining when training is considered complete. Unfortunately, without additional information, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer regarding the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete within this context.
