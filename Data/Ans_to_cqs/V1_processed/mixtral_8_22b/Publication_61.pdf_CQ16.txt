Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, some clues can be derived from the text. For instance, the model uses the Adam optimizer, which adjusts the learning rate automatically during training. This suggests that the optimization process might play a role in determining when training should stop. Additionally, the context mentions that the accuracy on the validation set was observed after training, implying that validation performance could also serve as a criterion for deciding when to halt training. Furthermore, the discussion of the peculiar behavior of the dataset in the first few epochs indicates that monitoring the relationship between loss and accuracy throughout training may provide insights into when to cease training. Nevertheless, without further information or explicit statements regarding stopping criteria, these assumptions remain speculative.
