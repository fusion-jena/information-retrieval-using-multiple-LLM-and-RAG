Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or managing random seed values. However, it does mention the use of the Random Forest Classifier (RFC), which inherently involves some level of randomness due to its nature of creating multiple decision trees from randomly sampled subsets of the dataset.

To address this issue, one strategy could be setting a specific seed value before training the model. By doing so, the results will become reproducible since the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers will be generated every time the code runs. Another approach would be employing cross-validation techniques such as k-fold cross-validation, where the dataset is divided into 'k' equal parts, and the model is trained and tested 'k' times, each time using a different subset as the test set. This helps reduce overfitting and provides more robust estimates of the model's performance.

However, without further details regarding the specific implementation of the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context, I cannot provide a definitive answer on how randomness is handled in this particular case.
