The given context does not provide specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it mentions various studies related to data collection, remote sensing, and image processing techniques. For instance, Zhang et al. (2023) discuss research on identifying land types and tree species using GF-1 remote sensing data. Similarly, Zhong et al. (2019) focus on deep learning-based multi-temporal crop classification. Other references like Lu et al. (2010) and Saboori et al. (2019) also mention the use of satellite imagery and Quickbird imagery for land cover classification and urban land use extraction respectively. Therefore, while the exact datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not mentioned, these studies suggest the use of remote sensing and satellite imagery datasets for their respective applications.
