The text does not explicitly state what type of data format is used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the input image size was 32 by 32 pixels, indicating that the data format used in this case is images. Additionally, the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) further supports this conclusion since they are commonly used for processing grid-like topology data such as images. Therefore, the data format used in this deep learning pipeline is images.
