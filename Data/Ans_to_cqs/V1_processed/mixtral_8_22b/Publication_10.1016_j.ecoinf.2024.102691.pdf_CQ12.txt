The paper uses a modified version of the YOLOv5 object detection model, which is based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). Specifically, they use a variant called Depth Attention YOLOv5, which incorporates a depth attention mechanism into the original YOLOv5 architecture. This allows the model to focus more on important features while suppressing irrelevant ones, improving its overall accuracy and robustness.
