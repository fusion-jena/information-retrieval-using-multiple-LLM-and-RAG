Based on the given context, it appears that no specific deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers are explicitly mentioned as being used in the pipeline. Instead, the authors have employed various machine learning algorithms including Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), Random Forest (RF), Flexible Discriminant Analysis (FDA), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Generalized Boosting regression Model (GBM), and Maximum-Entropy learning (MAXENT) for habitat suitability prediction. These algorithms do not fall under the category of deep learning models but rather belong to traditional machine learning techniques. Therefore, based on the information available, it cannot be determined what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline.
