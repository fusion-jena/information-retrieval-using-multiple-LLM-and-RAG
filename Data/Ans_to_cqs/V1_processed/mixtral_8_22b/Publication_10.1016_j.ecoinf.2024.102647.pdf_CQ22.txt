In the given context, the performance of machine learning models is evaluated using several criteria. However, it should be noted that these criteria are not specific to deep learning models but rather apply to machine learning models in general. The evaluation criteria mentioned include the coefficient of determination (R2), NSE (Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970), Klingâ€“Gupta efficiency (KGE) (Gupta et al., 2009), and correlation coefficient (COR) (Sardoei et al., 2024). These metrics assess different aspects of the model's performance, such as its ability to fit the data, predict new instances accurately, or capture the underlying patterns in the data. It is important to note that while some of these metrics may have similarities with common evaluation metrics for deep learning models like accuracy, precision, or recall, they are not directly equivalent. For instance, the coefficient of determination (R2) measures the proportion of variance explained by the model, which can be seen as a measure of 'goodness of fit'. On the other hand, accuracy, precision, and recall are more commonly used in classification tasks to quantify the number of correct predictions made by the model. Therefore, while there are overlaps between the two sets of metrics, they serve slightly different purposes and are used in different types of evaluations.
