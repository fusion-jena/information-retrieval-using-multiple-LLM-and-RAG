The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, based on the information provided about these models, it appears they are primarily used for image classification tasks. For instance, AlexNet, NiN, VGG, GoogLeNet, and ResNet are all deep learning architectures developed for image recognition and classification purposes. They use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically learn hierarchical representations of input images, allowing them to accurately classify objects within those images. Additionally, the mention of a final layer with a softmax function in deep CNNs further supports their usage for classification tasks, as this type of activation function is commonly employed in multi-class classification problems. Therefore, it can be inferred that the primary purpose of these deep learning models is to perform image classification tasks.
