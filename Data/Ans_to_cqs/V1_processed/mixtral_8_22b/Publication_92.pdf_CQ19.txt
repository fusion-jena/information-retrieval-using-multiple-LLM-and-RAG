The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. However, it does provide details about the architecture of the network, which follows the GoogLeNet's architecture with 27 layers, 9 inception layers, and a soft-max classifier. It also mentions the use of convolutional layers and adapting certain parameters such as the size of the strides and the first convolutions. Unfortunately, without explicit information regarding the framework used, it is impossible to definitively state whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other specific deep learning framework was utilized.
