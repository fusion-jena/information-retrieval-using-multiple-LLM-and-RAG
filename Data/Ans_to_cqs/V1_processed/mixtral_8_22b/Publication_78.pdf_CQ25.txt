The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is for classification. Specifically, it is used to classify whether the visual vocabulary features extracted from images of coral reefs are indicative of bleached coral or healthy coral. This is achieved through the use of various handcrafted descriptors and deep convolutional neural networks (D-CNNs), such as AlexNet, ResNet-50, VGG-19, GoogleNet, and Inceptionv3. Among these, AlexNet was found to have the highest accuracy. Additionally, Support Vector Machines (SVM) were used as the classifier, outperforming other classifiers like kNN and decision trees.
