The paper uses Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination (R^2) to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. These metrics are used to compare the predicted Canopy Height Model (CHM) from the deep learning model with the actual CHM derived from GEDI data. Additionally, these metrics are also used to correlate the horizontal heterogeneity (HH) with tree species diversity.
