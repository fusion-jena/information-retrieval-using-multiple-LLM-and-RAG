The paper by Shorten and Khoshgoftaar (2019) provides a comprehensive review of various data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. The authors discuss several methods such as flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, padding, zooming, shearing, and translation. These techniques help improve model performance and prevent overfitting by increasing the amount of training data available. For instance, flipping involves reflecting images horizontally or vertically, while rotation entails rotating images by a certain degree. Scaling adjusts the size of images, either enlarging or shrinking them. Cropping removes parts of an image, whereas padding adds extra pixels around it. Zooming magnifies or reduces the image content without changing its dimensions. Shearing distorts the image along one axis, and translation shifts the image position within the frame. Other advanced techniques include color space transformations, kernel filters, random erasing, mixing images, and generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, the choice of technique depends on the specific application and dataset characteristics.
