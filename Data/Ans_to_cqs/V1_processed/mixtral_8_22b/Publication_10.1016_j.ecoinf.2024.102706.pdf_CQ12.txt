Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any specific deep learning model being used in the pipeline. Although the text mentions the application of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) for semantic segmentation, it does not specify whether DCNN is part of the main pipeline for predicting forest canopy cover. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding which type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline.
