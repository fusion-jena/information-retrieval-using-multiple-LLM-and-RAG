The text does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, common practices include monitoring metrics such as validation loss or accuracy over epochs and stopping the training process when these values reach a plateau or no longer show significant improvement. Additionally, early stopping can be employed to halt training if the monitored metric stops improving for a certain number of consecutive epochs. These techniques help prevent overfitting and ensure optimal model performance.
