The given context does not provide information on the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context primarily focuses on various methods and techniques related to ecology and environmental studies, including Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR), Continuum Removal (CR), Random Forest (RF), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Successive Projections Algorithm (SPA), Weight Average Partial Least-Squares Regression (WAPLSR), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), etc. However, it does not mention any specific dataset used in these models or pipelines.
