In this study, the dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned as being part of any well-known datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the authors mention that their input data consists of various indices derived from remote sensing data, including ARI, Band 2, Band 3, Band 4, DEM, NDVI, Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Plant Senescence Reflectance Index (PSRI), REIP, TPI, Topographic Roughness Index (TRI), TWI, VBF, and VH. These inputs were specifically chosen to optimize the performance of the deep learning model used in this study, which is a U-Net convolutional neural network implemented in Python using the Keras deep learning library.
