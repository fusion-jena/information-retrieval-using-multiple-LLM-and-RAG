The given context does not provide information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The text mentions that researchers have developed numerous Water Quality Parameters (WQP) inversion algorithms for different lakes over the years, including Band Ratio (BR), Three Bands (TB), NDCI, NDTI, Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), and more. It also discusses the application of machine learning (ML) methods, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and neural networks like the Ocean Color Network (OCG), to estimate Chla concentrations in various water bodies. Additionally, ensemble learning (EL) techniques and quantile sketching algorithms like Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) and CatBoost are mentioned. However, there is no mention of any specific dataset used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
