The text does not provide information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or any specific strategies related to it, such as managing random seed values. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based on the given context.

Based on general knowledge, some common strategies used to manage randomness in deep learning pipelines include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, employing techniques like cross-validation, averaging results from multiple runs, and using deterministic algorithms where possible. However, these strategies are not mentioned or discussed in the provided context.
