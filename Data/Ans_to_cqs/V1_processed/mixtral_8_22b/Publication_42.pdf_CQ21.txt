After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be taken to analyze and validate the performance of the trained model. Some common postprocessing techniques include saliency maps, metrics calculations, and confusion matrices.

Saliency maps are visualizations that highlight the regions of input data that have the most significant impact on the output prediction made by the model. These maps help identify which features or areas of the input data contribute the most to the final classification decision. By examining these saliency maps, researchers can gain insights into how their models work and what factors they consider important when making decisions.

Metrics calculations involve evaluating the performance of the trained model using various quantitative measures such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Accuracy represents the proportion of correct predictions out of the total number of samples. Precision indicates the ratio of true positive predictions to the sum of true positives and false positives. Recall signifies the fraction of relevant instances retrieved out of the total number of actual positives. The F1 score combines both precision and recall into a single metric, providing a more balanced evaluation of the model's performance.

Confusion matrices provide a tabular representation of the predicted versus actual classes for each sample in the dataset. Each row of the matrix corresponds to an actual class, while each column represents a predicted class. The diagonal elements indicate the number of correctly classified samples, whereas off-diagonal entries denote misclassifications. Analyzing confusion matrices allows researchers to understand where their models struggle and which classes tend to get confused with one another.

Based on the given context, we can see that the authors evaluated their final system using summary statistics over three survey nights containing a high number of moths and varying species. They calculated the F1-score of their chosen model, achieving an impressive 92.75%. Additionally, they ranked their CNN architectures based on their F1 classification scores, indicating that they likely employed some form of metrics calculation during their postprocessing stage. However, there is no explicit mention of saliency maps or confusion matrices being utilized in this study.
