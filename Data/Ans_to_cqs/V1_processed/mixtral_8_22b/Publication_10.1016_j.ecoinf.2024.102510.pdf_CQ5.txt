The deep learning pipelines mentioned in the given context use several datasets for bird species identification. These include:

1. A dataset consisting of 83 bird species native to Indonesia with 8057 images. This dataset achieved an accuracy of 88.07%. However, it requires further testing on different deep learning models and development of methods for live bird detection in images.

2. Another dataset contains 31,320 images of 29 bird species but its description is noted as being inaccurate. It achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 98.39%.

3. The CUB-200-2011 dataset, which includes 11,788 images of 200 bird species, has been used twice in the given context. In one instance, it achieved accuracies of 85.70% and 82.10%, while in another, it reached 87.60% and 89.50%.

4. There is mention of a dataset containing 1000 images of three bird species, though no specific name or source is provided.

These datasets serve as the foundation for developing and improving deep learning models for bird species identification. They provide the necessary input for these models to learn patterns and features associated with each bird species, enabling accurate identification even when faced with challenges like varying lighting conditions, weather, and other environmental factors.
