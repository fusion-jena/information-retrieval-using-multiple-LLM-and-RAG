To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets such that each set maintains the same distribution of classes as the original dataset. This ensures that the classifier learns from a representative sample of the entire population.

Oversampling is a technique where synthetic samples are generated from the minority class to balance the dataset. This can help prevent overfitting and improve the accuracy of the classifier. Undersampling, on the other hand, involves removing samples from the majority class to achieve a balanced dataset. However, this may result in loss of information.

Diverse data collection involves collecting data from various sources to ensure that the dataset is representative of the entire population. This can help reduce bias and improve the generalizability of the classifier.

These techniques can be combined to further mitigate data bias. For example, stratified sampling can be applied before oversampling or undersampling to maintain the original class distribution. Additionally, diverse data collection can be used alongside these methods to create a more robust and accurate classifier.
