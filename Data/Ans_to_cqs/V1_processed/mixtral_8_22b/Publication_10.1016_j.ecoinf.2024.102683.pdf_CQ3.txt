The given context does not provide specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it mentions that deep learning models require a significant amount of labeled data to prevent overfitting. Data augmentation techniques are employed to increase and diversify the training dataset using existing data. These techniques create modified copies of the original dataset to improve the generalization ability of the network. Additionally, attention mechanisms are utilized to enable deep neural networks to focus precisely on relevant input elements, enhancing their performance in tasks like text classification, image interpretation, and sentiment analysis.
