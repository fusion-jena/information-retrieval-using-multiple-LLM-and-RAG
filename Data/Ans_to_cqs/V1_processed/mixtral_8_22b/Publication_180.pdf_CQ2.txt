The text does not explicitly state what type of data format is being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the data format used is 'image', since the authors mention working with digital images for Mexican and Brazilian triatomine species. They also discuss comparing cleaned and raw images for the Mexican species. Therefore, it can be concluded that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is 'image'.
