The pipeline uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), also known as deep networks, as the deep learning model. These models are particularly useful for various computer vision problems due to their ability to learn multiple layers of processing with both linear and non-linear operators. In this case, the authors employ the activations of the first fully connected layer of a pre-trained VGGnet as feature representations. Additionally, they fine-tune the weights of this deep network using the Benthoz15 dataset, which contains expert-annotated and geo-referenced marine images from Australian seas.
