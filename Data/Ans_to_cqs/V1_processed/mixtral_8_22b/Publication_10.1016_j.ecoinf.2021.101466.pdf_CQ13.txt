The deep learning model used is EfficientNet, which was trained using the Adagrad optimizer for 100 epochs. The dropout rate was set at 0.5 for each task. The batch size was set at 20. All evaluations were performed on the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080Ti GPU with 11G memory, running on Windows 10, Python 3.7, CUDA 10.2, and Keras 2.4.3 was used to build all models. However, the specific learning rate used is not explicitly stated in the given context.
