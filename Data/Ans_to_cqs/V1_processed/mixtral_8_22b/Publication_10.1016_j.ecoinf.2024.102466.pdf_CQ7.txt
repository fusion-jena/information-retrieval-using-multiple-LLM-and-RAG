The table titled 'Table 3' provides information about the number of images used for training and validation purposes. However, there isn't any explicit mention of how the data was divided into training, testing, and validation sets. Typically, datasets are randomly partitioned into three subsets: training set, validation set, and test set. The training set is used to fit the parameters of the model, while the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Lastly, the test set is used to evaluate the final model's performance. It appears that in this case, the authors only explicitly mentioned using a training set and a validation set, with 7773 images being used for training and 1943 images being used for validation. There is no clear indication of whether a separate test set was also utilized.
