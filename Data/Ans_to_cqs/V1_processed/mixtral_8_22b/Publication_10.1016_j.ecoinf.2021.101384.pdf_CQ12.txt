The given text does not explicitly mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it mentions that the Global Fishing Watch (GFW) distributes vessel data that are already classified through a machine learning model. Unfortunately, without additional information, we cannot determine whether this model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer model.
