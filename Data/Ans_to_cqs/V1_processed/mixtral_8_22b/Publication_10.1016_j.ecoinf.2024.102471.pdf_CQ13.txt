The deep learning model uses the Adam optimizer with an initial learning rate of 10e-5. This learning rate is suitable for small weight updates throughout the network during fine-tuning. Other hyperparameters include epochs set to 30 and a batch size of 1. These values were manually selected as optimal during the fine-tuning process.
