The text does not provide information on the deployment process of any trained deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer based on the given context.

Based on the provided context, it appears there isn't enough information to determine the specific process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on various studies related to vegetation disturbances and their methods, indices, and types of disturbances. It also discusses the use of Maximum Segments (MS) and Recovery Threshold (RT) values for modeling disturbance-recovery patterns but doesn't mention anything about deploying a trained deep learning model.
