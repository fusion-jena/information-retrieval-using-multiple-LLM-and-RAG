The paper does not provide explicit details about the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of a deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) for detecting farm dams from high-definition satellite images. This suggests that some form of image augmentation or balancing techniques might have been employed to ensure the model generalizes well across different regions and environments. Additionally, the mention of using diverse data sources such as regional and federal authorities implies that efforts were made to collect comprehensive and representative data. Nevertheless, without further clarification from the authors, it remains uncertain which exact techniques were utilized to mitigate potential data bias.
