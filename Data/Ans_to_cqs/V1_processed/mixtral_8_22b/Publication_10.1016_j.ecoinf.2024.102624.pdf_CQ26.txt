The text does not explicitly mention specific techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses several strategies that can indirectly help mitigate data bias and improve classification accuracy.

One strategy mentioned is training data augmentation, which involves extending the existing training data to enhance its generalization capabilities. This technique can potentially reduce bias by increasing the diversity of the training data. Another approach discussed is dealing with the geometry of the training data, including excluding outliers, refining training samples, or changing the proportion of training and test data. These methods can contribute to reducing bias by improving the quality and representativeness of the training data.

Additionally, the text mentions applying Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to determine the most important variables based on the largest overall accuracy. RFE is a variable selection method that can be combined with machine learning algorithms. By removing variables with low contributions and focusing on those with high contributions, this technique may help minimize bias introduced by irrelevant features.

In summary, although the text does not directly refer to techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, it describes various strategies that could aid in addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. These include training data augmentation, handling the geometry of the training data, and employing Recursive Feature Elimination for variable selection.
