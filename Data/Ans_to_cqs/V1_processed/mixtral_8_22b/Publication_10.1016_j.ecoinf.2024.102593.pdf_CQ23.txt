The authors explored dimensionality reduction as a method to assess the suitability of a model for transfer learning. They utilized the Brazil extract of the BirdCLEF 2020 dataset, which was not part of the original training set, to generate embeddings using three distinct models: VGGish, BirdNET, and a ResNet152 architecture model trained from scratch on the BirdCLEF 2020 dataset. The authors employed Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to decrease the dimensionality of these embeddings to two dimensions. Subsequently, they computed various metrics for the UMAP outcomes of each model, employing the dataset classes as labels to determine the silhouette coefficient. This approach allowed them to evaluate the performance of the models on unseen data, thereby ensuring the generalizability of the deep learning models. However, the text does not explicitly mention other techniques such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.
