Based on the given context, it appears that the study uses a grid search method (GridSearchCV) based on the out-of-bag (OOB) error and five-fold cross-validation to search for the optimal parameters of the Random Forest (RF) model. However, there is no mention of any specific optimization technique such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) being applied in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide information regarding which optimization techniques are applied in this case.
