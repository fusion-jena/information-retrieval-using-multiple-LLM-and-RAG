The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps for training a deep learning model. However, based on general practices in machine learning and deep learning, some common preprocessing steps include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing or correcting erroneous, missing, or irrelevant data from the dataset. In the case of image datasets like Sentinel-2 optical images mentioned in the context, it could involve handling missing pixels due to cloud cover or other atmospheric disturbances.

2. Normalization/Scaling: Deep learning models often perform better when input features are scaled to similar ranges. For instance, pixel intensities in images are usually normalized to a range between 0 and 1.

3. Augmentation: To increase the size of the dataset and improve the robustness of the model, various augmentations such as rotation, flipping, zooming, etc., can be applied to the original images.

4. Feature Extraction: Depending on the complexity of the task, additional features might need to be extracted from the raw data. For example, in the context of estimating forest density, features like texture, color histograms, etc., might provide useful information.

5. Label Preparation: For supervised learning tasks, labels corresponding to each sample must be prepared. These labels guide the learning process of the model.
