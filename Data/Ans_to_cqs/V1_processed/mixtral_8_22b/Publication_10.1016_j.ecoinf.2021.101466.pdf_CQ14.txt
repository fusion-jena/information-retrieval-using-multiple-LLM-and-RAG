The given context does not provide specific information about how the hyperparameters of the models used, such as YOLOv4 or EfficientNet, were optimized. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether techniques like grid search, random search, or other optimization methods were employed. To find this information, one would need to refer to the original research papers or resources where these models were introduced and implemented.
