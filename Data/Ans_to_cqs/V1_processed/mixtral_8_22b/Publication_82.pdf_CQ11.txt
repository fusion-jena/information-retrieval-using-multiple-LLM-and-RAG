The article does not provide information about the specific data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that all the experiments were conducted using their own fork of Caffe (Jia et al., 2014), which is a fast, open source framework for deep learning. It also states that the basic results, such as the overall accuracy, can be replicated using a standard instance of Caffe. Therefore, one might infer that the authors may have made their code and possibly some datasets available through their GitHub or another platform related to Caffe. To find this information, readers would need to search for the authors' GitHub profiles or other relevant platforms associated with Caffe.
