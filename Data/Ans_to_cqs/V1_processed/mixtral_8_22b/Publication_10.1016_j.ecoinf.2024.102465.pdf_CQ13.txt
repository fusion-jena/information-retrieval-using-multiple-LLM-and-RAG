Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the type of optimizer employed. It only mentions that the experiment utilized the pre-trained ERNIE model and later decided to employ the combined LSTM-CNN-based sentiment analysis framework for determining the sentiment index. However, it does not delve into the details regarding the configuration of these models or their respective hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this query based solely on the given context.
