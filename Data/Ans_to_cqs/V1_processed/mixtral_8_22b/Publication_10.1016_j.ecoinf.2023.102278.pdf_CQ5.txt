The paper mentions the use of the TLm dataset for training and validation of the models. However, it does not provide any further information about this dataset. Additionally, the authors mention using pre-trained weights from ImageNet for transfer learning. Therefore, it can be inferred that the ImageNet dataset was also utilized in their study. Unfortunately, there is no explicit mention of other commonly used datasets like MNIST or CIFAR in the provided context.
