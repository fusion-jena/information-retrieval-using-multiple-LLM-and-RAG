The provided context does not explicitly mention specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses various techniques employed when working with Deep Neural Networks (DNN), including dimensionality reduction of embeddings and analysis of embeddings. These techniques could potentially help mitigate overfitting indirectly by reducing the complexity of the learned representations. Additionally, the text mentions the use of transfer learning, which involves leveraging knowledge gained from solving one problem to solve a different but related problem. This approach might also aid in preventing overfitting since the transferred knowledge often generalizes better to new tasks. Nonetheless, without explicit information about the use of regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding these specific techniques.
