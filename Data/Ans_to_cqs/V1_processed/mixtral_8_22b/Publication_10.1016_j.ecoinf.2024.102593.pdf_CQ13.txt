The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. However, it discusses the use of different types of layers (convolutional, pooling, flatten, etc.) in creating complex algorithms known as Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). These DNNs consist of neurons arranged in successive layers that apply computations based on learnable parameters (weights and bias) and activation functions to inputs from previous layers. The text also mentions the use of dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE applied to embeddings generated by the BirdNET model. Unfortunately, without more detailed information about the specific implementation of these DNNs, it is not possible to provide exact values for hyperparameters such as the learning rate or optimizer.
