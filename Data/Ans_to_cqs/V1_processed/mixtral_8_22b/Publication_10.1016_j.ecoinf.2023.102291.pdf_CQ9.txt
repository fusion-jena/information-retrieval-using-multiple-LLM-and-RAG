The supplementary data for the article can be found online at <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2023.102291>. However, it does not explicitly state which specific data repository platform hosts the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the exact data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. It could potentially be hosted on platforms such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF, but further information would be needed to confirm this.
