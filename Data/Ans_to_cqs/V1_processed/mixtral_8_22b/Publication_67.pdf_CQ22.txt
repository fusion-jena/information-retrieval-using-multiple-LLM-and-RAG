To evaluate the performance of the deep learning models, three metrics are used: precision, recall, and F1-measure. Precision is calculated as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives. It measures how many of the predicted positive cases are actually correct. Recall is calculated as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives. It measures how many of the actual positive cases are correctly identified. The F1-measure is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced evaluation metric. These metrics are used to assess the performance of the two Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based models in this study.
