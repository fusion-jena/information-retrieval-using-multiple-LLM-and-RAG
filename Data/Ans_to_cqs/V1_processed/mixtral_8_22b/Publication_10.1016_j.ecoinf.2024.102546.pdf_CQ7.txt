The paper does not provide explicit information on how the authors split their data for deep learning model training (e.g., into train, test, and validation sets). However, it is common practice in machine learning to use a portion of the dataset for training the model, another portion for validating the model during training, and a final portion for testing the model after training. This helps ensure that the model can generalize well to unseen data. Typically, the dataset is divided randomly into these subsets, with the most common ratios being 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. These percentages may vary depending on the specific requirements and constraints of each project.
