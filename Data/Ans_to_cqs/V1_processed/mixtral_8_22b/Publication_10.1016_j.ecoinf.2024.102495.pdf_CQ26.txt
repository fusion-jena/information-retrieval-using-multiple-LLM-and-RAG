The text does not provide information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, common methods include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Stratified splitting ensures that each subset of data maintains the same distribution of classes as the original dataset. Oversampling increases the number of instances in the minority class by duplicating existing samples, while undersampling decreases the number of instances in the majority class by randomly removing some samples. Diverse data collection involves gathering data from various sources to ensure that the dataset represents different populations and scenarios accurately. These techniques help mitigate data bias and improve the overall performance of deep learning models.
