Unfortunately, there isn't enough context provided to determine what specific process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, typically, after training a deep learning model, the next steps would involve saving or serializing the model, selecting a platform for deployment, and then integrating the serialized model into the chosen platform. This can include cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, etc., or edge devices depending on the use case. Once deployed, the model can receive input data, perform predictions, and return output results. But without more details about the specific scenario, I cannot provide a more precise answer.
