The dataset was divided into two parts: 70% for training and the remaining 30% for validation. No explicit mention was made about a separate testing set. The training set was further augmented using various techniques such as flipping the images and labels along the X or Y axis, exchanging between multiple image channels, randomly rotating the images and labels by 90 degrees, and randomly adding noise to the images while keeping the labels unchanged. During the training process, if the validation loss value did not decrease after five consecutive epochs, the learning rate was halved. If there was no decrease in the validation loss value after ten consecutive epochs, the training process was terminated.
