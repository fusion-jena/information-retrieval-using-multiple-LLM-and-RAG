To improve the generalizability of their deep learning model, the authors took several measures. First, they modified BatNet and optimized its parameters, specifically adjusting the batch size. They added new kinds of BNorm layers after the 22 convolutional layers to prevent overfitting during training. This modification allowed the model to learn trends in both known and unknown datasets instead of focusing solely on maximizing performance on the training datasets. Second, they increased the batch size to 128, enabling the model to process more images per iteration. Lastly, they tested the model using various datasets, including a validation dataset containing 19,614 images, audio files from a corridor for 15 species, and audio files recorded under different human and natural conditions. These tests helped lower misidentifications and false positives while improving the model's ability to generalize across different environments and conditions.
