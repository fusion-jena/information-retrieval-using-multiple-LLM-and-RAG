The given context does not provide information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Instead, it discusses the use of big data on valve gaping from sentinel organisms along with temperature and chlorophyll data to improve predictions on productivity and aid in aquaculture decision-making. The data analysis was conducted using R 4.0.5, and gaping data was collected and processed differently depending on the location (Venice Lagoon vs. Wadden Sea). However, no mention is made of any image-based data annotation techniques typically employed in deep learning pipelines.
