The text does not provide explicit information about the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions that the researchers conducted experiments using machine learning (ML) techniques, specifically focusing on bounding box models for accelerating the data labelling process. They evaluated the effects of ML model performance on tagging efficiency and found that ML bounding boxes significantly improved tagging efficiency compared to unassisted tagging. Furthermore, they discovered that gains in efficiency were dependent on the ML algorithm's performance, indicating that some form of performance monitoring must have taken place. Nevertheless, the exact strategy employed to monitor the model performance during training remains undisclosed within the given context.
