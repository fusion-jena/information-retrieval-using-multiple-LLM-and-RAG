The text does not explicitly mention which specific deep learning framework is used to construct the deep learning models. However, it mentions that H2O, a machine learning platform, is used within R to construct the deep learning models. Therefore, we can infer that the authors utilized H2O's deep learning capabilities along with the programming language R to develop their models.
