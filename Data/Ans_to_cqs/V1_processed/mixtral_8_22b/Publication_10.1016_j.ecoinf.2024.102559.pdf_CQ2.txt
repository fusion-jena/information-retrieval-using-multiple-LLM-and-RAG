The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data. Specifically, the study uses freely available aerial images from the 2020 National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) archive with a resolution of 0.6 meters per pixel. These images are then processed using supervised machine learning classification algorithms to identify iceplant, a destructive invasive species. The goal is to provide a detailed understanding of the location and area occupied by the harmful invasive species and enable repeat assessments over time and in other regions.
