The data collection is split into eleven groups based on visual morphological characteristics. Each group consists of several plant species varieties in the range of 7-14 plants per group, covering 100 medicinal plant species. The training, validation, and testing proportions are set to 70:20:10 in both levels. Apart from the GSL100 dataset, two additional datasets, RTL80 and RTP40, are used. These datasets consist of random collections captured in real-time and are used to assess the efficiency of the proposed hierarchical classification model. The main evaluation objective using these random groups is to analyze the sensitivity of the classifier samples collected in various real-time scenarios. Table 3 provides insights into the distribution of trained, tested, and validated samples across the groups. Consistent ratios across groups are maintained in the sampling process to avoid potential bias during classification. Different samples are present across groups to establish the reliability and generalizability of the model. Both validation and test sets are considered separately to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters, leading to generalizability and scalability towards unseen datasets.
