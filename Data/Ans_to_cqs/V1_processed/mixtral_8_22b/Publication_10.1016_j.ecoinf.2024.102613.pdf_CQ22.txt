The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. However, common metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, and area under the curve (AUC). Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of total predictions made. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made. Recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positives. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. The ROC curve plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate, while the AUC represents the degree or measure of separability between classes. It is important to note that the choice of metric depends on the problem being solved and the desired outcome.
