The paper does not explicitly state the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions that the parameter values were selected based on the RMSEcv values, which suggests that cross-validation may have been used during the training process. In general, common criteria for determining when training is complete include reaching a minimum error threshold, achieving a stable validation loss or accuracy, or observing no further improvement in performance metrics after several iterations. Without more information from the authors, we cannot definitively say what criteria they used to determine when training was complete.
