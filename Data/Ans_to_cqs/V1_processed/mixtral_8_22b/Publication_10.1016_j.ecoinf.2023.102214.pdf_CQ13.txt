The text does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. However, it mentions that models were trained and tested by tuning the number of epochs and checking for signs of overfitting. This suggests that the authors adjusted the number of training iterations to find the optimal balance between underfitting and overfitting. Additionally, they likely employed some form of regularization technique to prevent overfitting, although the exact method is not specified.
