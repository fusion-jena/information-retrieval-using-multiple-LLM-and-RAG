The given context does not provide any specific details about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. It only discusses the use of a nested hierarchical classification (NHC) methodology for distinguishing between different land cover configurations based on thematic spectral classes and information classes. The references cited do not seem to directly address the optimization of hyperparameters either. Therefore, it is not possible to determine from this context how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized.
