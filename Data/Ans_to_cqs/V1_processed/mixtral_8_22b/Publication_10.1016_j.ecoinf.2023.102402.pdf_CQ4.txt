The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses various methods used to collect and analyze data related to seahorse species occurrences. These methods include using citizen science surveys, social media, diving centers, fishing events, and questionnaires. Additionally, the text mentions the use of ORACLE values averaged over 14 years and available for global-scale applications at a spatial resolution of 5 arcmin. It also describes the production of benthic layers through an interpolation process considering the geographical position and depth of cells. Unfortunately, without more specific information about the deep learning pipeline or machine learning models employed, I cannot provide detailed information on the data augmentation techniques used.
