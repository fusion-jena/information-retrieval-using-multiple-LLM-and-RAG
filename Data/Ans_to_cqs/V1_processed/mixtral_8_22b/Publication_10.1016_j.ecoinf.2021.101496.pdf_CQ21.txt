After the model training, several postprocessing steps can be taken depending on the type of model and the desired outcome. In the given context, three different models were trained - Linear Model (LM), Generalized Linear Model (GLM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) - to predict the SPAD value. After training these models, the following postprocessing steps were carried out:

1. Validation: Once the models were trained using the 'training dataset', they were validated using the 'testing dataset'. This step helps evaluate how well the models perform on unseen data.

2. Comparison: The performance of all three models was compared. The mean deviance of the model response from SPAD value measurements was calculated for each model. Additionally, the mean absolute difference between predicted and actual values was determined for the test data.

3. Selection: Based on the validation and comparison, the best performing model was chosen. In this case, despite having similar levels of accuracy, the Linear Model (LM) was preferred because it is simpler and easier to implement.

4. Analysis: Further analysis was conducted on the ANN model due to its inherent variability. Multiple runs of the ANN were executed, and the model residuals were analyzed to ensure reliability.

These postprocessing steps help assess the quality of the models, select the best performing ones, and ensure their robustness before incorporating them into practical applications.
