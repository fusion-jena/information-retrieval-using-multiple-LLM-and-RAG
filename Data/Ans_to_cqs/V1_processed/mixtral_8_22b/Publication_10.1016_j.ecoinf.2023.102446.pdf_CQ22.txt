The given context does not provide any direct information about the evaluation metrics used for the deep learning model. However, it mentions the use of transfer entropy (TE) bits information and the average number of TE links as measurements for evaluating the strength of links between sources and targets. These metrics might be related to the performance of the deep learning model indirectly if they were used as part of the training or validation process. Nevertheless, without explicit mention of specific evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc., we cannot definitively state which metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model based on the provided context.
