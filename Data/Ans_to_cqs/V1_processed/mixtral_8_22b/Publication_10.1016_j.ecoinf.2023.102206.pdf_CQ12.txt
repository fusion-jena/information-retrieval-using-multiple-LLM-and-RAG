The given context does not explicitly mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it mentions that Salaken et al. (2019) employed deep learning, and Sousa et al. (2020) proposed a transfer learning approach with data augmentation techniques for wildfire detection. Additionally, there is a reference to using acoustic data and deep CNN to identify oestrus and non-oestrus sounds of sows. Therefore, based on these references, we can infer that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been used in some applications mentioned in the context. However, without more explicit information, we cannot definitively state that CNNs were used in all cases or that other types of deep learning models such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers were not also utilized.
