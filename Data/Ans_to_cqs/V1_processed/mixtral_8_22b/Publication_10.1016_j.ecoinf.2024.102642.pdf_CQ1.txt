The text does not provide explicit information on the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the study leverages multi-annotation campaigns involving both expert and novice annotators to address the challenges associated with the scarcity of ground truth data in underwater Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) studies. It also refers to the use of audio signals recorded during the OHASISBIO program, which were collected at the SWAMS site using a hydrophone deployed at a depth of 1000 meters. Therefore, we can infer that one method used for collecting raw data involves deploying hydrophones in underwater environments to capture audio signals. Additionally, the involvement of multiple annotators suggests that human input plays a significant role in the data collection process.
