Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention any specific hyperparameters such as learning rates or optimizers used for the deep learning model. However, it does provide information about some aspects of the model's architecture and loss functions.

For instance, the total loss function used in the model is a linear combination of three different losses: adversarial loss (Ladv), perceptual loss (Lper), and L1 loss. These losses are combined with scaling factors λ1 and λ2, which are set to 7 and 3, respectively.

Additionally, the context mentions that the network uses batch normalization and leaky ReLU activation functions after each convolution layer. The encoder part of the network consists of five blocks, starting with a convolutional layer with 32 output channels and strides of 2, followed by a residual block. Each residual block contains a Conv-ReLU-Conv structure.

However, without further details regarding the specific implementation of the deep learning model, it is impossible to determine other important hyperparameters like learning rate, optimizer, number of epochs, etc.
