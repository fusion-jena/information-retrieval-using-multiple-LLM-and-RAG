Based on the given information, it is not explicitly stated what specific data format is used in the deep learning pipeline. However, there are some clues that suggest the use of image data. For example, the mention of "images" and "Convolutional Neural Networks" implies that the data being processed might be in image format. Additionally, the reference to "dpi" (dots per inch) also suggests that the data could be related to images. Therefore, while it cannot be definitively confirmed without further context, it can be inferred that the data used in the deep learning pipeline is likely in image format.
