Based on the provided context, there isn't any explicit mention or discussion about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some common strategies to manage randomness include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using techniques like cross-validation, averaging multiple runs, or employing ensemble methods to mitigate the impact of random initialization and improve overall performance.
