The text does not provide information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions that the analysis was conducted using Python and Scikit-learn, which are commonly used tools for machine learning tasks. In general, common criteria for determining when training is complete include reaching a minimum validation loss or accuracy, achieving a certain number of epochs, or observing no further improvement in model performance. Without more specific details, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer to this question based solely on the given context.
