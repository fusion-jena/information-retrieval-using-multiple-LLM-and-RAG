Unfortunately, based on the given information, it does not explicitly state where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The sources mentioned in the text discuss various aspects of machine learning and deep learning techniques applied to ecology and biodiversity studies but do not provide specific details about the location or accessibility of their respective data repositories. Therefore, without additional context or information, it is impossible to determine where the data repository of this particular deep learning pipeline can be found.
