Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of which specific cloud platform or service provider was used to deploy the deep learning model. The text only mentions that training deep neural networks typically requires expensive computational resources such as multiple high-end GPUs often available on high-performance computing clusters. Therefore, without additional context, we cannot determine the exact platform used to deploy the deep learning model.
