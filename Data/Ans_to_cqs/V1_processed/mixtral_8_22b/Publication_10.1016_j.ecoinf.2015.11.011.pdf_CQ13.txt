The given context does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in any deep learning model. The text discusses segmentation and classification strategies in eCognition, including the use of machine learning techniques for image classification. However, it does not mention any details regarding the implementation of a deep learning model, such as the choice of learning rate, optimizer, or other hyperparameters. Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot determine what hyperparameters were used in the deep learning model.
