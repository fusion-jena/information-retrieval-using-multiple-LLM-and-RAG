The text does not provide explicit information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, it mentions that they adopt a broader and more conservative cross-validation strategy, which involves excluding three multitemporal transects (~17% of the data) for testing in each iteration. They also mention that they use the same training parameters from before, ensuring that each fold was not contaminated from previous folds. Additionally, they perform a cumulative evaluation by measuring the modelâ€™s performance across all transects using coefficient of determination (R^2) between true vs predicted for all 648 multitemporal transects predictions. Based on this information, it can be inferred that the completion of training might depend on the number of iterations or the stability of the model's performance over time. However, without further details, it is impossible to pinpoint the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete.
