The given context does not provide information on any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Instead, it discusses building a three-layer backpropagation artificial neural network using MATLAB R2014b for predicting Total Suspended Solids (TSS) based on Absorbance Coefficient of Dissolved Organic Matter (aCDOM) and Fluorescence Intensity (Fn). The network has two inputs corresponding to aCDOM(254) and Fn(355), one intermediate layer, and one output layer representing the predictor (TSS). The maximum training time is set to 10,000 iterations, and the training error threshold is 0.001. Sixty-four water samples are used for model calibration, while the remaining samples are employed for validation. The validation accuracy is evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R^2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) between the measured and predicted TSS values.
