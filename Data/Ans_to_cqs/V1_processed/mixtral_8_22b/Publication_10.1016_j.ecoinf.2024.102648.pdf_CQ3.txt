The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is important to note that data annotation plays a crucial role in training deep learning models. Commonly used data annotation techniques include bounding box annotation, where objects within images are identified by drawing rectangles around them, and instance segmentation, where each pixel in an image is classified according to the object or class it belongs to. Other techniques include semantic segmentation, landmark annotation, polygon annotation, and key point annotation. Each technique serves different purposes depending on the type of problem being solved and the nature of the dataset. In this case, since the research focuses on forecasting the percentage of disease incidence using machine learning and deep learning models, it can be assumed that some form of data annotation was likely used during the development of these models. However, without further information, we cannot determine the exact data annotation techniques used in this particular study.
