The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a grid search method called GridSearchCV. This method is based on the out-of-bag (OOB) error and five-fold cross-validation. The specific hyperparameters mentioned in this context include the number of trees (n_estimators), minimum number of leaves (minleaf), and number of randomly selected node-split feature variables (max_features). The n_estimators are spaced at 50 intervals, ranging from 100 to 1000. The minleaf can be 2, 5, 10, 20, or 50. The max_features are spaced at intervals of 1, ranging from 1 to k where k is the number of characteristic variables.
