The paper does not provide specific details about the data annotation techniques used in their deep learning pipeline. However, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. These techniques help label datasets with relevant information such as object location or class identification, enabling models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to better understand and interpret visual data.

Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangles around objects within images to identify their locations. Semantic segmentation labels each pixel in an image according to its corresponding class, while instance segmentation further distinguishes individual instances of the same class. Depending on the requirements of the project, one or more of these techniques may be employed during the data annotation process.
