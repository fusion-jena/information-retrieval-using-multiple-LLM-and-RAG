The text does not provide information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it mentions several real-life datasets used in ecology studies, including the sparrow population dataset and two simulated datasets from Matthiopoulos et al. (2015) and Matthiopoulos et al. (2011). These datasets were used to evaluate the performance of various machine learning models, including Random Forests (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost).
