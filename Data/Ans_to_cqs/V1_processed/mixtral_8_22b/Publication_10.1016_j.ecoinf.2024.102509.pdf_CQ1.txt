The sources mentioned provide various examples of how raw data is collected for use in a deep learning pipeline. For instance, Yang et al. (2018) used remote sensing techniques to collect data on grassland above-ground biomass in the Three-River Headwaters Region. Similarly, Byrd et al. (2014) evaluated different sensor types for mapping biomass of coastal marsh emergent vegetation. These studies demonstrate the use of sensors and remote sensing technology for gathering raw data.

Additionally, Bogunovic et al. (2014) conducted spatial analysis of soil nutrients on sandy-loam soil using soil sampling methods. This illustrates another method of collecting raw data through field surveys or sampling.

Furthermore, some researchers utilize publicly available datasets such as those from the World Agroforestry Centre (2011), which provides access to their databases containing information related to agroforestry systems worldwide.

Overall, these sources showcase several ways in which raw data can be gathered for use in a deep learning pipeline including but not limited to: remote sensing technologies, field surveys, and utilizing existing public datasets.
