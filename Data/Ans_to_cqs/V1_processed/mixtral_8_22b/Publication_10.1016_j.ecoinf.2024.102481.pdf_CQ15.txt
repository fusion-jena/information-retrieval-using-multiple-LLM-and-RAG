The given context does not provide information about specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it mentions that Random Forests (RFs) are widely used in machine learning for both classification and regression tasks. While this doesn't directly address the query regarding optimization techniques in deep learning pipelines, it highlights the popularity of RFs in machine learning applications. Unfortunately, without additional context, I cannot provide further details on optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines.
