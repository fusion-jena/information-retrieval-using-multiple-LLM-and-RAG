The text does not provide explicit information about the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge, some common techniques include stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified sampling involves dividing the dataset into homogeneous subgroups or'strata', then selecting samples from each stratum in proportion to the size of the stratum. This ensures that all strata have equal representation in the final sample.

Oversampling is a technique where the minority class is increased by replicating examples from this class. Undersampling, on the other hand, reduces the majority class by randomly removing examples from this class. Both methods aim to balance the classes in the dataset.

Diverse data collection refers to collecting data from various sources to ensure that the model learns from a wide range of examples. This can help reduce bias and improve the model's performance on unseen data.

Again, these are general techniques and may not necessarily be applied in the context of the given text. For more specific information, additional resources would need to be consulted.
