The given context does not provide information about the use of any techniques to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some commonly used techniques to handle data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes or labels in both sets. This ensures that the classifier learns from a representative sample of each class.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to balance datasets with imbalanced classes. Oversampling involves duplicating examples from the minority class, while undersampling involves removing examples from the majority class. These techniques can help prevent the classifier from being biased towards the majority class.

Diverse data collection involves collecting data from different sources, demographics, and environments to ensure that the dataset is representative of the population it aims to serve. This technique helps reduce bias caused by sampling errors and selection bias.
