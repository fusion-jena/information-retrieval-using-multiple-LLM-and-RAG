The method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is through the use of camera traps. Camera traps are remotely activated cameras that capture images when triggered by motion or heat. They have been widely adopted in wildlife monitoring due to their non-intrusive nature and ability to collect data over extended periods. In this particular case study, camera traps were employed to gather images of the Eurasian lynx and its prey species. These images serve as input for the deep learning model, enabling it to learn features specific to each species and subsequently classify them accurately. This approach allows researchers to efficiently process vast quantities of visual data, thereby facilitating the analysis of complex ecological systems.
