The purpose of the deep learning model used in this study is semantic segmentation, specifically for land cover mapping. Semantic segmentation involves assigning each pixel in an image to a specific class label, allowing for detailed scene understanding. In this case, the goal is to accurately map different types of land cover, such as vegetation, water bodies, buildings, etc., within satellite imagery. The authors use the DeepLabV3+ model, which has been shown to perform well in various computer vision tasks, including semantic segmentation. They modify the original DeepLabV3+ architecture to accommodate four-channel input images (RGB + Near-Infrared) and train it using a large amount of data and significant GPU resources. By doing so, they aim to create a robust and accurate land cover mapping tool that can aid in environmental monitoring and management efforts.
