The given context does not provide specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and landmark annotation. These techniques help label the data for various tasks such as object detection, image segmentation, pose estimation, etc.

Bounding box annotation involves drawing a rectangle around objects within an image to identify their location. Semantic segmentation involves assigning a category to every pixel in an image, while instance segmentation involves identifying individual instances of objects within an image. Polygon annotation involves outlining the shape of objects within an image using vertices. Key point annotation involves marking specific points on objects within an image, while landmark annotation involves identifying specific features on objects within an image.

However, without explicit mention in the given context, we cannot confirm which specific data annotation technique(s) were used in the deep learning pipeline discussed.
