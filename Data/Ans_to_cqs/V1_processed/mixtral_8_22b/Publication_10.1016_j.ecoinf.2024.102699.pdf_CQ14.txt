The text does not provide explicit information regarding the method used for hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search or random search. However, it mentions specific values for certain hyperparameters, including an initial learning rate of 0.0001, a batch size of 32, and a concatenating cosine-annealing linear scheduler. These details suggest that some form of hyperparameter tuning has been performed, but the exact method remains unspecified.
