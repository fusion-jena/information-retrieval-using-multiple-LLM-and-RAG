Based on the given context, it does not provide specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is completed, such as validation loss plateau. However, generally speaking, in machine learning, some common criteria used to determine when training should be stopped include:

* Validation Loss Plateau: Training can be considered complete when the validation loss stops decreasing significantly after each epoch. This indicates that the model may have reached its maximum performance on the validation set.
* Early Stopping: This technique involves stopping the training process before the model starts to overfit the training data. It requires setting a patience parameter, which specifies how many epochs to wait without improvement before stopping the training.
* Maximum Number of Epochs: Another simple criterion is to stop training after a certain number of epochs, regardless of whether the model has converged or not.
* Learning Rate Schedule: Some models use a learning rate schedule that gradually reduces the learning rate as training progresses. Once the learning rate reaches a minimum value, training can be considered complete.
