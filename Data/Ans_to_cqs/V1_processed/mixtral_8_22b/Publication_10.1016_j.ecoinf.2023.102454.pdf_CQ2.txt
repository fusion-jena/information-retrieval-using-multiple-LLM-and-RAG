The information provided does not explicitly mention the use of a deep learning pipeline or any specific data formats such as images, audio, video, or CSV files. However, it discusses various data sources used in the research, including nighttime lighting data, provincial statistical energy data, administrative boundary data, and carbon emission factors for various energy sources. These data sources may come in different formats like text, numerical data, or geospatial data. Without further details about the processing methods or analysis techniques employed in the study, it is difficult to determine if these data sources are used in a deep learning pipeline or what specific data formats they might take within such a pipeline.
