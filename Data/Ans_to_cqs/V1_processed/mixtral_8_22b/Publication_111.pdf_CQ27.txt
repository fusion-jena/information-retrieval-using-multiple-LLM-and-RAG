The text does not explicitly mention the specific process used to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. However, it does indicate that the proposed work involves comparing statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models to determine their performance gaps in predicting marine data. The proposed generic framework consists of three stages: data gathering, preprocessing, and machine learning model deployment. It uses the Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency dataset and employs a deep learning model combining gated recurrent units (GRU) with a regular neural network. The GRU layer is preceded by an input layer and followed by a fully connected layer, allowing the prediction of values from the output layer. Although the exact method of model deployment is not specified, it can be inferred that the final step of the framework would involve deploying the chosen model(s) after completing the necessary training and evaluation processes.
