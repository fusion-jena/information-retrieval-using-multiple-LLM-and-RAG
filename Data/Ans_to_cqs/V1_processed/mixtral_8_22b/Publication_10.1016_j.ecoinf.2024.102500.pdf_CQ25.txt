The text does not provide explicit information about the specific purpose of the deep learning model, such as whether it is intended for classification, segmentation, or detection tasks. However, it can be inferred from the context that the primary goal of the deep learning model is to accurately predict and analyze water quality measures, specifically nitrate and dissolved oxygen levels. The authors employ various machine learning algorithms, including gradient boosting (LGBM), random forest (RF), and extreme tree (ET), which are then combined to create a stacking-based artificial neural network (ANN) meta-machine learning model. The main objective of this approach is to improve the overall accuracy and predictive capabilities of the models, making them suitable for use in academic research and publications related to water quality management.
