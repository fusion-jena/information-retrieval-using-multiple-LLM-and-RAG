The given context does not provide information about the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, zooming, and adding noise. These techniques help increase the amount of training data available and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data. It is important to note that the choice of data augmentation technique depends on the nature of the problem being solved and the characteristics of the input data. Without further context or information, it is impossible to determine which specific data augmentation techniques were used in this case.
