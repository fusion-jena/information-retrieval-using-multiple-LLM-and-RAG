The performance of the deep learning model, specifically the SGRU model, is evaluated using two main metrics: Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). These metrics help assess the difference between predicted and actual values, providing insights into the accuracy of the model. Lower MAPE and RMSE values indicate better model performance. In comparison to other statistical and machine learning models such as ARIMA, SARIMA, ETS, HWETS, SVR, and SLSTM, the SGRU model demonstrated significantly higher accuracy based on the MAPE metric.
