The information provided does not directly address the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it can be inferred that the researchers used some form of data labeling or annotation given they were able to extract Area Under the Curve (AUC) values from multiple machine learning models. These models likely required labeled data to train and evaluate their performance. Common data annotation techniques in deep learning include image classification, object detection (bounding boxes), semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. Without more specific details about the dataset and models used, it is impossible to determine which exact annotation technique was implemented in this case.
