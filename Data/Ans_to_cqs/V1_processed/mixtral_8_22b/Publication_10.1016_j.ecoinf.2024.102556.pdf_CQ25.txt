Based on the given context, the purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated. However, considering the references to object detection, tracking, and identification, we can infer that the deep learning model is likely used for object detection tasks. This is further supported by the mention of models like YOLOv7, which are known for their use in real-time object detection applications. Additionally, the context mentions the integration of Efficient Layer Aggregation Network (E-ELAN) and cascade-based modeling, both of which are commonly used in object detection models. Therefore, while not explicitly stated, it appears that the deep learning model discussed here is primarily intended for object detection purposes.
