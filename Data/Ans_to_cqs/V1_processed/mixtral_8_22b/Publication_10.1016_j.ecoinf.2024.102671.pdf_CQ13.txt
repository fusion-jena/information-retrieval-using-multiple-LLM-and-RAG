The given context does not provide any specific details about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model such as learning rate or optimizer. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact hyperparameters used in this particular scenario. However, some common hyperparameters used in deep learning models include learning rate, batch size, epochs, optimizers like Adam, RMSprop, etc., and activation functions like ReLU, sigmoid, tanh, etc. The choice of these hyperparameters depends on various factors such as the nature of the problem, available computational resources, and the dataset being used. It is recommended to perform hyperparameter tuning to find the optimal set of hyperparameters for a given task.

Based on the provided context, I cannot give a helpful answer regarding the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
