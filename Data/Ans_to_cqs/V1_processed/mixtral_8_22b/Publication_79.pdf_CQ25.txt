The objective of this work is threefold: (1) to hierarchically classify the Brazilian Savanna physiognomies based on deep learning techniques according to their respective major groups; (2) to analyze the contribution of different spectral bands to improve network accuracy; and (3) to apply some hierarchical behavior in classification tasks. In addition, the authors aim to use a U-Net architecture for semantic segmentation of Brazilian savanna vegetation using high spatial resolution satellite data. This involves performing end-to-end classification, learning features from input datasets, and presenting increasing complexity through layers of the network. The results achieved with such methods often outperform those obtained with traditional machine learning algorithms like RF or SVM. For savanna vegetation, efforts have already been made with deep learning to delineate tree crowns and identify vegetation patterns including different tree heights.
