Based on the given context, it is not explicitly mentioned what specific dataset was used for the deep learning pipeline. However, from the context, we can infer that the dataset used might be related to wild bird species since the research involves analyzing videos containing various wild bird species. The dataset likely includes features such as the number of subscribers in the channel, thumbnail information, bird species that appear, and names of target places. Additionally, the researchers used R software version 4.1.2 with several packages like Boruta, lmerTest, car, MuMIn, and randomForest for their data analysis. Unfortunately, without more explicit information about the dataset used, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding which specific dataset was utilized in the deep learning pipeline.
