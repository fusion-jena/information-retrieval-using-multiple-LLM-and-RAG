Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to determine which specific framework was used to build the deep learning model. The text mentions that the LSTM model is trained using the mean squared error (MSE) loss function and the ADAM optimization algorithm, but it doesn't specify whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or another framework was utilized for building the model. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to your query based solely on the provided context.
