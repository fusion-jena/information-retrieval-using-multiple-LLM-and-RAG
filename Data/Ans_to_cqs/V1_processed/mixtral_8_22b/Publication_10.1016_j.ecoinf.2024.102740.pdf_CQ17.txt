Regularization methods are used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data. Two common regularization methods are Dropout and L2 Regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to make the model more robust and prevents it from relying too heavily on any single feature. This can be thought of as creating multiple models within one network, each using different subsets of features. During testing, all neurons are used, but their outputs are scaled down proportionally to the amount of dropout applied during training.

L2 Regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the sum of squared weights. This encourages smaller weights, making the model simpler and reducing its capacity to memorize noise in the training data. It can be seen as adding a constraint to the optimization problem, forcing the solution to have small weights.

These regularization methods help improve the generalization performance of deep learning models by preventing them from becoming too complex or fitting the training data too closely. They are often combined with other techniques such as early stopping and data augmentation to further reduce overfitting.

The specific choice of regularization method depends on the nature of the problem and the available resources. For example, Dropout may be preferred if computational resources are limited, while L2 Regularization might be better suited for problems with many irrelevant features. Ultimately, the best approach will depend on empirical evaluation and experimentation.
