The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it can be inferred that some common postprocessing steps might include metrics calculation and confusion matrix generation.

In this study, several experiments (EXP1 - EXP5) were conducted using different models and approaches for Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) classification mapping. The performance of these models was evaluated using metrics such as Overall Accuracy (OA) and Kappa coefficient. This is evident from Figures 7 and 9, which compare the classification results from different experiments and tile sizes based on OA and Kappa. Additionally, Figure 8 shows a spatial comparison of land categories between classification results from EXP1 to EXP5.

These evaluations suggest that postprocessing steps likely included calculating metrics like OA and Kappa to assess the performance of each experiment. Furthermore, generating a confusion matrix could also be a possible postprocessing step, as it provides insights into the misclassifications made by the models.

However, without more specific details regarding the postprocessing steps mentioned in the research, it cannot be confirmed whether saliency maps or other advanced visualization techniques were used. Therefore, while we can infer that metrics calculation and confusion matrix generation were probable postprocessing steps, the involvement of additional methods remains uncertain based solely on the provided context.
