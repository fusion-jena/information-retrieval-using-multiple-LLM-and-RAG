Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be taken to improve its performance. These may include data normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Data normalization involves transforming the input features so they fall within a specific range, often between 0 and 1. Scaling refers to adjusting the values of numeric columns to have similar scales, which helps prevent certain features from being given more importance due to their larger numerical values. Cleaning data involves handling missing values, removing outliers, and correcting inconsistent entries. Additionally, feature engineering techniques such as encoding categorical variables, extracting relevant features, and dimensionality reduction might also be applied depending on the dataset and problem requirements.
