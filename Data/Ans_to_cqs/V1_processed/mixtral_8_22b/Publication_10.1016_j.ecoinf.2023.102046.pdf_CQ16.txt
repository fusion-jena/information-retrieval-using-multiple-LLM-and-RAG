The text does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, based on common practices in machine learning, some possible criteria include reaching a certain number of epochs or iterations, observing a plateau or decrease in validation loss, or achieving a desired level of accuracy or other performance metric on the validation set. In this case, the authors mention performing hyperparameter search for their classification and regression models, which suggests they may have used cross-validation techniques to evaluate the performance of different parameter settings during training. They also present results showing the accuracy of their models for various hyperparameters, indicating that they likely monitored performance metrics throughout the training process. Without more detailed information, however, it is difficult to definitively state what specific criteria were used to determine when training was complete.
