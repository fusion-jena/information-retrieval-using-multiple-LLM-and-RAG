Based on the provided context, it appears that there are several preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, the specific details regarding normalization, scaling, or cleaning are not explicitly mentioned. Nevertheless, we can infer some preprocessing steps from the information available.

Firstly, the text mentions the use of semi-supervised deep learning, which involves combining labeled and unlabeled data in a framework. This implies that the dataset needs to be divided into labeled and unlabeled portions before being fed into the model.

Secondly, the study discusses the generation of initial training data through LIDAR-based unsupervised detection. This suggests that the raw LIDAR data might have undergone some form of processing to extract relevant features for tree detection. Although the exact preprocessing techniques are not specified, they could potentially include noise reduction, filtering, or segmentation.

Lastly, the text also refers to the retraining of the model based on a small number of hand-annotated trees. This indicates that the original dataset might have gone through a manual verification process to ensure accurate labeling.

In conclusion, while the specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning are not directly addressed in the provided context, we can deduce that the dataset likely underwent division into labeled and unlabeled sets, feature extraction from LIDAR data, and possibly manual verification for accurate labeling.
