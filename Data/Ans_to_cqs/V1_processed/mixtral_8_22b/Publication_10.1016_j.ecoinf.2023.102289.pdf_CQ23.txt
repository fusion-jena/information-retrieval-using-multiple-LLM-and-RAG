To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the model was built upon the deeplabv3+resnet269 model, which is a combination of a semantic segmentation algorithm developed by Google and a 269-layer Resnet neural network. This choice of model provides a robust foundation for the task at hand.

Secondly, the model was trained on the ADE20K dataset, which focuses on the recognition of 150 indoor and outdoor objects. This diverse dataset helps to ensure that the model can handle a wide range of scenarios, thereby improving its generalizability. Furthermore, the use of 55 outdoor visual landscape elements from this dataset further enhances the model's applicability to landscape applications.

Lastly, while the text does not explicitly mention the use of techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting, these are common practices in machine learning to prevent overfitting and ensure the model's performance on unseen data. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that similar measures may have been taken to ensure the model's generalizability, although they are not explicitly stated in the provided context.
