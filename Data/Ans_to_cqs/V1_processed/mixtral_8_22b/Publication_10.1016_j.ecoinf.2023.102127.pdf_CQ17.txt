The paper by Friedman, Hastie, and Tibshirani (2010) discusses regularization paths for generalized linear models using coordinate descent. However, this paper does not specifically mention the use of regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization in the context of deep learning pipelines. These techniques are commonly used to prevent overfitting in neural networks. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to make the network more robust and prevents it from relying too heavily on any single feature. L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function based on the size of the weights, encouraging smaller weights and reducing overfitting. Other regularization methods include early stopping, which halts training when performance on a validation set stops improving, and batch normalization, which standardizes inputs to each layer of the network. While these methods are widely used in deep learning, they are not explicitly discussed in the papers referenced here.
