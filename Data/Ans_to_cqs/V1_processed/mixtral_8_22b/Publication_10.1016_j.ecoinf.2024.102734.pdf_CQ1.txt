The text does not provide explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that raw field data are segmented into 5-second spectrograms, which suggests that the data might be collected through field recordings or sensor deployments. Additionally, the use of a pre-trained feature extraction model implies that publicly available datasets could also be employed for this purpose. Nevertheless, further details regarding the exact methodologies used for gathering raw data are not explicitly stated within the given context.
