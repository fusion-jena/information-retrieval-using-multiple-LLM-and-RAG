The text does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it mentions several experiments conducted to evaluate the performance of the models under different scenarios. These include:

1. Within-site: Using pretraining and hand-annotated data to predict evaluation data from the same site. This suggests that the data might have been split based on geographical locations or sites.

2. Cross-site: Using pretraining data and hand-annotated data from one site to predict evaluation data from another site. This also indicates that the data could have been divided according to their respective sites.

3. Transfer learning: Training a model using pretraining data from all other sites except the target site, along with hand-annotations from the target site. This implies that the data might have been partitioned based on the source and target sites.

Additionally, the text discusses a sensitivity analysis where models were trained using varying proportions of training data (5%, 25%, 50%, and 75%) compared to the full dataset. This further supports the idea that the data might have been segmented based on the amount of available training data.

In conclusion, while the exact criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training remain unknown, the experiments mentioned suggest that the data may have been divided based on geographical location, source/target sites, and the proportion of available training data.
