To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, a diverse dataset was utilized for training the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This involved selecting 6092 photos (approximately 10% of the full set) from the aerial survey imagery, ensuring a wide variety of background features. These photos did not include any images known to contain bears, thus focusing the training on distinguishing between various types of backgrounds rather than identifying specific objects like polar bears. Each photo was then cropped to 224 x 224 pixels at a random location, matching the CNN's input size. Additionally, another 1000 photos were randomly selected and cropped to serve as background validation images. These images helped assess the network's classification accuracy during the training process.

Moreover, image manipulation and augmentation techniques were employed to further enhance the model's ability to generalize. While the text does not explicitly mention what specific manipulations and augmentations were applied, common practices include rotating, flipping, zooming, shifting, and adjusting brightness levels of the images. These techniques help create more varied training examples, allowing the model to better recognize patterns and features across different conditions.

Lastly, although not directly mentioned in the given context, cross-validation and stratified splitting could have been additional methods used to improve the model's generalizability. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into multiple subsets and iteratively training the model on different combinations of these subsets. This helps prevent overfitting and provides a more robust estimate of the model's performance. On the other hand, stratified splitting ensures that the distribution of classes remains consistent across the training, validation, and test sets, preventing any class imbalance issues that might negatively impact the model's performance.
