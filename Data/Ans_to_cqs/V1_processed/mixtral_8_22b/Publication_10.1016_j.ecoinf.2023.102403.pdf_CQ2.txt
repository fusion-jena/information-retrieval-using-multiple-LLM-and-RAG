Based on the given context, it appears that the datasets being utilized primarily consist of species occurrence records, including taxonomic information and geographical coordinates (i.e., longitude and latitude). This suggests that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is likely structured textual data, possibly in a tabular format like CSV or Excel spreadsheets.

The context mentions several databases containing marine information, such as FishBase, GBIF, and OBIS. These platforms store various types of data related to marine life, including taxonomy, ecological information, and historical records. While some of these databases may contain multimedia files like images or videos, the focus of the context seems to be on the use of structured textual data rather than other formats like images, audio, or video.

In summary, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is structured textual data, potentially in a tabular format like CSV or Excel spreadsheets.
