Data bias can significantly impact the performance and fairness of a deep learning model. To mitigate this issue, several techniques can be employed during the preprocessing stage of the deep learning pipeline. Here are some commonly used methods:

1. Stratified Splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes or labels in both subsets. It ensures that the model is trained and evaluated on representative samples, reducing the risk of overfitting or underfitting due to class imbalance.

2. Oversampling: In cases where one class has fewer instances compared to others, oversampling can help balance the dataset by duplicating examples from the minority class. A popular method for oversampling is Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), which generates new synthetic samples based on feature space similarities between existing minority instances.

3. Undersampling: Contrary to oversampling, undersampling reduces the number of majority class instances to match the size of the minority class. Random Under Sampling (RUS) is a simple approach that randomly removes samples from the majority class until it reaches the desired proportion. However, this may lead to loss of valuable information.

4. Diverse Data Collection: Collecting diverse datasets with varying features and characteristics can also help reduce data bias. By incorporating different sources, demographics, and perspectives, models become more robust and generalizable across various scenarios.

5. Data Augmentation: This technique involves creating new data points by applying transformations such as rotations, translations, scaling, or flipping to existing images. For non-image data, noise injection or interpolation can be applied. Data augmentation helps improve model performance and prevent overfitting by increasing the amount of available training data.

These techniques should be carefully chosen depending on the specific requirements and constraints of each project. Combining multiple strategies might yield better results when addressing data bias during preprocessing in deep learning pipelines.
