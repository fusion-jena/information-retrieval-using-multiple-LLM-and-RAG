The purpose of the deep learning model used in this study is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, based on the overall goal of the study, it can be inferred that the deep learning model was likely used for classification purposes. This is because the study aims to evaluate the use of automated signal recognition software, such as a deep learning model, for monitoring cryptic and nocturnal bird species. Specifically, the study mentions the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for identifying bird and frog species in tropical soundscape recordings. CNNs are commonly used for image or audio classification tasks, where they learn to classify input data into different categories based on patterns in the data. Therefore, it can be assumed that the deep learning model in this study was used for classifying bird sounds into different species categories.
