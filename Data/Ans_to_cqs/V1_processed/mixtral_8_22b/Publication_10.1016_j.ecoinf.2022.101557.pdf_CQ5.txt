Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does state that OpenStreetMap data is utilized, specifically referring to a planet dump from OpenStreetMap contributors in 2017. Additionally, the context discusses the use of a 10-fold cross-validation technique, where the data is divided into ten subsets, nine of which are used for training and one for testing. It can be inferred that the dataset consists of images or maps, considering the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Nevertheless, without further information, it cannot be definitively stated what other datasets might have been employed in the deep learning pipeline.
