The code repository of the deep learning pipeline used in this research is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, one of the references cited in the text mentions a GitHub repository related to bird sounds: 'Google Creative Lab/AI Experiments Bird Sounds, 2016. <https://github.com/googlecreativelab/aiexperiments-bird-sounds>.' It is possible that this repository contains some relevant code or resources, but without further information, I cannot confirm if this is the exact code repository used for the deep learning pipeline in this study.
