The text does not explicitly state what specific type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline. However, it mentions that a self-supervised (red, green, blue (RGB)) deep learning model is employed. This suggests that the model could potentially be a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), as they are commonly used for processing RGB images. Nevertheless, without further information, we cannot definitively confirm this assumption.
