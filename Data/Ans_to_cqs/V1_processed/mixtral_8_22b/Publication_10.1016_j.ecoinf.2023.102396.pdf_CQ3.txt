The given context does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it discusses feature-based and shape-match classifications of animal population time series using dynamic time warping, hierarchical clustering, machine learning, state space models, and trend analysis. These methods can be considered as part of the broader process of preparing and analyzing datasets for various applications, including deep learning pipelines. Nevertheless, without further details about the dataset preparation and preprocessing steps, it is impossible to determine which specific data annotation techniques were employed in this study.
