Both data sets were split into training and testing images with a ratio of 80:20, respectively. For the SSLs’ data set, the first 800 images were used for training, and the remaining 148 were used as test images to evaluate the model’s performance. For the elephants’ data set, 1649 images were used for training, while 452 images were used for testing. No explicit mention of a separate validation set was made; however, the use of early stopping suggests that there may have been a validation set or cross-validation method used during training to prevent overfitting.
