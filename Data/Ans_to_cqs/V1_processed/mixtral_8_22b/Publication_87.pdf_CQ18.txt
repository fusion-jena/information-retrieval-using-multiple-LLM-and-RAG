The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using the fit\_one\_cycle function from the fastai library. This function trains the model for a specified number of epochs while applying a learning rate schedule that varies the learning rate over time. Additionally, the SaveModelCallback function is used to save the model after each epoch, allowing for easy access to intermediate models for further analysis or fine-tuning. The progress of the training process can be monitored by observing the loss values for both the training and validation sets, as well as the accuracy and error rate metrics. These values are displayed in real-time during training, enabling the user to track the model's performance and adjust hyperparameters if necessary.
