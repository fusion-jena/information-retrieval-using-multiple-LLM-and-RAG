The criterion used to determine when training is complete is based on the validation EarthNetScore (ENS). Training is stopped once the validation ENS repeatedly fails to improve compared to the score evaluated from previous epochs. The model at the epoch with the highest attained validation score is then selected. This indicates that the model has converged and further training would not significantly improve performance.
