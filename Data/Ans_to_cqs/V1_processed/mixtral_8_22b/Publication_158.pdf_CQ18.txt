The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves monitoring the validation data across training epochs. The network weights with the best performance are kept, and early stopping criteria are applied if no improvement is found in 50 epochs. Additionally, an ensemble of three models is generated, and the average of the final output layer is taken to address variability in the results due to weight initialization and random selection for batch training.
