The papers referenced do not directly discuss regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, some related concepts are mentioned. For instance, the use of transfer learning and data augmentation can help improve the performance of deep learning models and reduce overfitting.

Transfer learning involves utilizing the learned parameters from one task to initialize the model for another task. By doing so, it allows the model to leverage previously gained knowledge and adapt more quickly to new tasks. This technique has been shown to enhance the performance of deep learning models across various domains, including computer vision and natural language processing.

Data augmentation is another method employed to mitigate overfitting. It entails generating additional training samples by applying random transformations to existing ones. These transformations may include rotation, scaling, flipping, and cropping. The resulting expanded dataset helps expose the model to diverse variations of input data, thereby improving its ability to generalize better and reducing overfitting.

While these techniques contribute to addressing overfitting, they do not explicitly cover traditional regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are temporarily removed during training, forcing the remaining neurons to learn more robust features. On the other hand, L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function based on the magnitude of the weights, encouraging smaller weight values and preventing any single feature from dominating the decision boundary. Both methods have proven effective in combatting overfitting in deep learning pipelines.
