The text does not provide explicit information about specific preprocessing steps used before training a deep learning model. However, it mentions one important step - missing value imputation. Missing value imputation is a method used to fill in missing values in a dataset with substituted values. It is often performed prior to applying machine learning techniques such as deep learning. Other common preprocessing steps include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization rescales features so they have similar magnitudes, while scaling adjusts the range of feature values. Cleaning involves removing or correcting erroneous data points. These steps help improve the performance and efficiency of deep learning models.
