Based on the given context, there isn't enough information to provide a detailed explanation of the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, I can give some general insights into common postprocessing steps often performed after model training. These may include:

1. Model evaluation metrics: Calculating various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC, etc., depending on the problem type (classification or regression).

2. Confusion Matrix: This is particularly useful for classification problems where we want to understand how well our model performs across different classes. It provides insight into false positives, true negatives, false negatives, and true positives.

3. Saliency Maps: In case of deep learning models, saliency maps help visualize which parts of the input data had the most impact on the modelâ€™s prediction. They highlight important features contributing towards the final output.

4. Hyperparameter tuning: Post-training, hyperparameters might need adjustment based on validation set results. Grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, etc., are commonly employed techniques for this purpose.

5. Ensemble methods: Combining multiple trained models to improve overall performance. Techniques like bagging, boosting, stacking, etc., fall under this category.

However, without specific details about the model being trained or the task at hand, these points serve only as broad guidelines rather than definitive answers.
