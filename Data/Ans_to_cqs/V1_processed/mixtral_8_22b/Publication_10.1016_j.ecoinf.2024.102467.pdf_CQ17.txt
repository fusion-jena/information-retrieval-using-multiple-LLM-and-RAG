While the given context does not explicitly mention specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization, it does discuss the use of regularization methods in the EfficientNetV2 network. According to the text, EfficientNetV2 employs an improved progressive learning approach that dynamically adjusts the regularization method based on the training image size. However, the exact nature of these regularization methods is not specified. Regularization techniques like dropout and L2 regularization are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting by adding constraints to the learning process. Dropout randomly sets a fraction rate of input units to 0 during training time, helping to avoid complex co-adaptations on training data. On the other hand, L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, encouraging weights to be small, thus reducing complexity and improving generalization. It should be noted that without explicit details about the regularization methods employed in EfficientNetV2, we cannot definitively state whether they include dropout or L2 regularization.
