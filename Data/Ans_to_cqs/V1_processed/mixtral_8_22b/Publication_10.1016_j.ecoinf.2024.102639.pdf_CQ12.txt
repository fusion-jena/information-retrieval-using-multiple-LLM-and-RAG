The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it mentions that deep learning methods are being integrated into animal behavior studies, which traditionally have not been extensively utilized for modeling or predicting animal movement. It also refers to the use of neural networks, which can be considered a subset of deep learning models. Furthermore, it discusses the use of Support Vector Machines (SVM) for training a model on a dimensionally reduced dataset. But no specific mention is made of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot definitively determine what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline.
