The query asks about strategies used to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, specifically mentioning the example of a random seed value. However, based on the given context, there isn't any direct reference or discussion regarding this topic. Therefore, it would not be possible to provide a specific strategy from the given sources.

In general, some common strategies used to manage randomness in deep learning pipelines include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, employing techniques like cross-validation, bootstrapping, or bagging to reduce variance caused by random sampling, and using regularization methods such as dropout or weight decay to prevent overfitting due to random initialization. Nonetheless, these strategies cannot be directly linked to the provided context without further information.
