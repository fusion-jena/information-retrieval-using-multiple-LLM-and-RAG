The paper does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it mentions that the deep feature loss bird noise reduction network model was trained for 50 epochs on an RTX 2080 Ti GPU using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 10. In each epoch, the entire training set was presented in a random order, with one noisy bird sound signal per iteration. This approach could help improve the model's ability to handle various types of noise and bird sounds, contributing to its generalizability. Additionally, the authors compare their method with other bioacoustic noise reduction algorithms, which can also indicate the robustness and applicability of their model across different scenarios.
