The authors utilize various methods for collecting raw data in their deep learning pipeline. For acquiring NDVI data, they use the MOD13A2 dataset from the Google Earth Engine platform with a spatial resolution of 1 km and temporal resolution of 16 days. They collect original images of the MRB spanning from January 2001 to December 2020, which totals 460 images (23 images per year). Preprocessing steps include proportional scaling, projection transformations, and mask extraction based on watershed boundaries. Additionally, the authors select 12 drivers related to climate, terrain, and human activity, including evaporation, sunshine duration, relative humidity, precipitation, temperature, elevation, slope, aspect, geomorphological type, nighttime light, population density, and road distance. However, the specific method used for collecting these driver variables is not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
