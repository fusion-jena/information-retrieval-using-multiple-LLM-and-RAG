Based on the given context, it appears there might be some confusion regarding the topic of discussion. The context provided discusses spectral characteristics of dissolved organic matter in Plateau Lakes and identifying eutrophication indicators in Southwest China. However, the query asks about data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Since this information isn't covered within the provided context, I cannot provide a direct answer. Nevertheless, here's a brief overview of common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines:

1. Bounding Box Annotation: This technique involves drawing boxes around objects in images or videos to identify their location. It's commonly used in object detection tasks.

2. Instance Segmentation: Unlike semantic segmentation which groups pixels belonging to the same class together, instance segmentation identifies each distinct object in an image separately.

3. Semantic Segmentation: Each pixel in an image is assigned a label corresponding to its enclosing object or region.

4. Polygon Annotation: Used when objects have irregular shapes. Annotators draw polygons around these objects to mark them accurately.

5. Key Point Annotation: Also known as landmark annotation, it involves placing dots on specific parts of an object to capture its shape and contour.

6. Image Classification: Images are categorized into predefined classes. For example, cats vs dogs, apples vs oranges etc.

7. Text Annotation: Mainly used for NLP tasks where text needs to be tagged with relevant labels.
