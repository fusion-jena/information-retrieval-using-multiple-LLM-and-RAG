Unfortunately, there isn't enough context provided to determine the exact data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The given text discusses the use of deep learning models for identifying sub-alpine shrub species based on images, but does not provide specific details about where the code or data for these models might be stored. It mentions three fieldwork missions conducted in 2021, but again, doesn't give any links to the collected data. Additionally, Table 4 shows some results obtained from different deep learning networks, but without further context, it's impossible to infer the location of the associated code or data. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested data repository link.
