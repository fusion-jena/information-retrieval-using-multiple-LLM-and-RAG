Based on the provided information, there isn't any explicit mention of the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it can be inferred that the researchers might use common machine learning practices such as monitoring the validation loss or accuracy over epochs and stopping the training process once the validation loss plateaus or the validation accuracy stops improving significantly. Additionally, they could also employ early stopping mechanisms to prevent overfitting by halting the training process if the validation loss starts to increase while the training loss continues to decrease. Nevertheless, without more detailed information regarding their exact training procedure, we cannot provide a definitive answer.
