The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, considering the overall theme of the research, which focuses on investigating phenological features to improve the performance of deep learning in detecting invasive Spartina alterniflora, it can be inferred that the deep learning model used here is primarily intended for classification tasks. This assumption is further supported by the mention of comparing two different classifiers - Stacked Autoencoders (SAE) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) - in the context. Therefore, the primary objective of the deep learning model in this study appears to be accurately classifying or identifying areas affected by the invasive Spartina alterniflora species.
