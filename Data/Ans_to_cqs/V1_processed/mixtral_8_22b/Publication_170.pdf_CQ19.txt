Based on the given information, it does not explicitly state which specific frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch were used to build the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer based solely on the provided text. However, it mentions that a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) model was employed, but without specifying the exact framework utilized.
