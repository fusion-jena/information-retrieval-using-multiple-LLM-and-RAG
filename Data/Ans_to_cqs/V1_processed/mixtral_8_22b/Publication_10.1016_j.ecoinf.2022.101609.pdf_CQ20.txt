Based on the given information, it appears that the deep learning model was trained using Oracle Cloud instances. Specifically, Table 4 lists the hardware specifications of the two Oracle Cloud instances used to test scalability. One of these instances is a Compute - Ampere A1 instance, which does not have any GPU type listed. However, the other instance is a VM.GPU instance, which uses a Pascal GPU type. Therefore, it can be inferred that the deep learning model was likely trained using a NVIDIA P100 GPU.
