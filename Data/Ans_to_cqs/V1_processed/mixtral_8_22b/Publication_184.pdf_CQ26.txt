Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, the text does discuss the use of data augmentation techniques to extend the amount of data available for training the model. Data augmentation can help mitigate issues related to limited or imbalanced datasets, thus potentially addressing some forms of data bias. The described data augmentation process includes applying transformations like horizontal flipping, grayscaling, blurring, adding noise, and cropping to generate new variations of the existing images. These techniques can contribute to creating a more balanced and diverse dataset, indirectly helping to tackle data biases. Nevertheless, without further details about the dataset and its potential biases, it cannot be confirmed if these methods were explicitly employed to counteract data bias.
