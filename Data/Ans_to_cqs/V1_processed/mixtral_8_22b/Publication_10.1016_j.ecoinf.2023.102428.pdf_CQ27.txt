Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available from the given context to provide a detailed explanation about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, based on common practices in deploying deep learning models, some general steps can be mentioned. These include saving the trained model using model serialization methods such as pickle in Python or saveModel() function in TensorFlow, selecting a suitable platform for deployment like cloud services (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) or edge devices, and then loading the saved model onto the chosen platform for making predictions.
