The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned as one of the common datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it can be inferred that the authors used custom datasets consisting of digital images of Mexican and Brazilian triatomine species. Specifically, they mention training the algorithm with 405 images for Mexican triatomine species and 1,584 images for Brazilian triatomine species. Therefore, the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline were custom image datasets containing labeled images of Mexican and Brazilian triatomine species.
