The given context does not provide information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, some commonly used data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, zooming, shearing, and translation. These techniques help increase the amount of training data available for building models without actually collecting new data. They also improve the robustness and generalizability of the trained models.

Flipping involves reflecting images horizontally or vertically. Rotation involves rotating images by a certain degree. Scaling involves resizing images either uniformly or non-uniformly. Cropping involves removing parts of images to focus on important regions. Zooming involves magnifying images to simulate closer views. Shearing involves distorting images along an axis. Translation involves shifting images along an axis.

These techniques can be applied individually or combined to create even more variations of the original dataset. It is essential to ensure that any transformations applied during data augmentation preserve the semantic meaning of the input data. Otherwise, they may introduce unwanted biases into the trained models.
