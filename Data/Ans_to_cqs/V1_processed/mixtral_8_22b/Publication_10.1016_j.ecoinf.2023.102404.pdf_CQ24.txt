To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the random seed value, various strategies are employed. One common strategy is to use a fixed random seed value throughout the entire process. By doing so, the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers will be generated every time the code is executed, ensuring reproducibility of results. Another strategy is to perform multiple runs with different random seed values and evaluate the stability and reliability of the results. This helps to identify any potential issues related to randomness and improve the overall robustness of the model. Additionally, some studies may also explore the impact of different random seed values on the final outcome by conducting sensitivity analyses or comparing the results obtained from different runs. Overall, handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline requires careful consideration and appropriate strategies to ensure the validity and reliability of the findings.
