The provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, including managing random seed values. However, some general approaches can be mentioned. Randomness in deep learning pipelines often arises from various sources like weight initialization, data shuffling, dropout regularization, or even hardware-related factors. To manage these aspects, one common strategy is setting a fixed random seed value across different stages of the pipeline, ensuring reproducibility and consistency in experiments. Another approach involves conducting multiple runs with different seeds and averaging the results to mitigate the impact of randomness. Additionally, techniques like deterministic algorithms or parallel computing methods can also help reduce variability caused by randomness. Nonetheless, without specific details about the deep learning pipeline in question, it is challenging to provide a precise solution.
