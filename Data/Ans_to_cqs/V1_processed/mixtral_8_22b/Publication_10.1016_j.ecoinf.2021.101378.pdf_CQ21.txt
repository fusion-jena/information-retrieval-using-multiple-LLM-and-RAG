After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be taken to evaluate the performance of the machine learning models used for predicting potential occurrences of pine wilt disease. Some common postprocessing steps include calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess the overall performance of the model. Additionally, creating confusion matrices can provide insights into the types of errors made by the model, such as false positives or false negatives. Visualization techniques like saliency maps can also be employed to understand which input features had the most significant impact on the model's predictions. Furthermore, ensemble models can be created by combining multiple individual models to improve overall performance and robustness. Lastly, it is essential to consider the effects of climate change when interpreting results, as changes in temperature and precipitation may influence the spread and severity of pine wilt disease.
