The given context does not provide any specific details about the evaluation metrics used for the deep learning model mentioned in the paper. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the exact metrics used to evaluate its performance. However, common evaluation metrics for deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, and area under the curve (AUC). These metrics help measure the effectiveness of the model in predicting or classifying outcomes accurately. Without further context, I can only speculate which metrics might have been employed in evaluating the deep learning model discussed in the study.
