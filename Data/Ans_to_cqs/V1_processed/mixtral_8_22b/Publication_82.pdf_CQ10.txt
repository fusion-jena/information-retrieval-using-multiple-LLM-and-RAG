The authors did not provide any specific information about the code repository link of their deep learning pipeline in this excerpt. However, they mentioned that all the experiments were conducted using their own fork of Caffe (Jia et al., 2014), which is a fast, open-source framework for deep learning. Therefore, it might be possible to find the relevant code by searching for the authors' names or keywords related to their work within the Caffe project on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Unfortunately, without more specific details, I cannot provide a direct link to the exact code repository.
