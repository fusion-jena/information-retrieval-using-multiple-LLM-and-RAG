Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no explicit information about the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context mentions the use of deep neural networks but does not provide details regarding the optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). It only discusses the effects of sample size and network depth on the performance of the deep learning approach to species distribution modeling.
