Based on the given context, it does not provide specific information about the preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model. However, generally speaking, common preprocessing steps include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and augmentation. Normalization scales the input features to a range between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1, while scaling rescales the input features to have a specified range. Cleaning involves removing any missing or irrelevant data points, while augmentation generates new data samples through various transformations such as rotation, flipping, zooming, etc. These preprocessing steps help improve the performance and efficiency of the deep learning models during training.
