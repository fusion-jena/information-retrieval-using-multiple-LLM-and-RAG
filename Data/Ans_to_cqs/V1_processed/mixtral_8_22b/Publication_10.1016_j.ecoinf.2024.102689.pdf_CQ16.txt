The text does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, it mentions using a rigorous folded cross-validation methodology involving a cyclical process of training and testing. This implies that the training might be stopped based on some form of convergence or stability in the performance metrics across different folds. Commonly used criteria include reaching a certain number of epochs, achieving a desired level of performance on a validation set, or observing no significant improvement in validation loss over several epochs. Given the focus on comparing the proposed model against benchmarks like YOLOv5 and YOLOv8, it can be inferred that the training was likely continued until there were no further improvements in the evaluation metrics mentioned in Table 3.
