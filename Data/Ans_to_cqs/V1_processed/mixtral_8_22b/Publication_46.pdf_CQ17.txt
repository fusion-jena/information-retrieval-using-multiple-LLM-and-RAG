Regularization methods are techniques used in machine learning and deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise instead of general patterns, leading to poor performance on new, unseen data. Two common regularization methods mentioned in the given context are Dropout and L2 Regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent complex co-adaptations on training data. This forces the network to learn more robust features that are useful in conjunction with many different random subsets of the other neurons. In essence, dropout can be viewed as a way to ensemble many neural nets within a single model.

L2 Regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of all the weights in the network. This encourages smaller weights, effectively limiting the complexity of the learned model and preventing overfitting. It should be noted that L2 Regularization does not reduce the number of parameters but rather constrains their values.

Other regularization methods not explicitly mentioned in the given context include L1 Regularization, Early Stopping, and Data Augmentation. L1 Regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the absolute value of the weights, encouraging sparse solutions. Early Stopping involves monitoring the model's performance on a validation set during training and stopping the process once the performance starts degrading. Data Augmentation generates additional training samples by applying transformations such as rotations or flips to existing examples, increasing the diversity of the dataset and helping the model generalize better.
