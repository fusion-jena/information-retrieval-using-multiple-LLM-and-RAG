The text does not provide explicit information about the specific purpose or type of the deep learning model used. However, based on the context, we can infer that the model might be used for predicting soil classes or mapping environmental data. The term'response function' suggests that the model is likely used for regression tasks, such as predicting continuous values related to environmental variables. Additionally, the mention of 'variable selection and regularization behavior' indicates that the model might involve feature engineering or dimensionality reduction techniques. Lastly, the reference to'spatial autocorrelation information for model prediction' implies that the model takes into account the spatial relationship between different data points, possibly for generating maps or visualizing predictions across geographical areas.
