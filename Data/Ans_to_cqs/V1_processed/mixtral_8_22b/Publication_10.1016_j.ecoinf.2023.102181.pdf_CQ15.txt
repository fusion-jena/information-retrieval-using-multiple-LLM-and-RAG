The given text does not provide any direct information about optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it discusses the use of bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) in machine learning models, particularly in the context of reducing bias during model training and validation. Bagging is an ensemble method that involves creating multiple subsets of the original dataset, fitting a model to each subset, and combining their predictions to improve overall performance. It is often used with decision tree algorithms like Random Forest. While bagging is not an optimization technique per se, it contributes to improving the accuracy and robustness of machine learning models.
