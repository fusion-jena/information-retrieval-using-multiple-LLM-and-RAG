The context does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, it mentions that the explanatory variables were selected using'regsubsets' in the R package 'leaps'. This suggests that some form of feature selection or variable reduction technique might have been employed during the modeling process. Unfortunately, without further details, it cannot be confirmed whether techniques such as grid search or random search were utilized specifically for hyperparameter optimization.
