The given context does not provide explicit details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on common practices in deep learning pipelines, it is possible to infer potential techniques used. Since the research focuses on automatic standardized processing and identification of tropical bat calls, one likely technique could be audio annotations, where experts manually label different parts of the audio files to identify various bat species. This process might involve assigning labels to segments of audio recordings containing echolocation calls produced by individual bat species. Another possibility could be the use of spectrograms, which are visual representations of audio signals, allowing researchers to visually inspect and annotate the unique characteristics of bat echolocation calls. These annotations would then serve as ground truth data during the training phase of the deep learning algorithms. Unfortunately, without more specific information regarding the data annotation techniques employed in this particular study, these possibilities remain speculative.
