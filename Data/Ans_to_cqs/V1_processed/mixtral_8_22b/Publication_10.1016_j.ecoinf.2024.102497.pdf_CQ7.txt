The given context does not provide explicit information on the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, common practices in machine learning include splitting the dataset into three subsets: training, testing, and validation.

Typically, the training set is used to fit the model, while the testing set is employed to evaluate its performance after fitting. The validation set can be used during the model selection phase to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Common ratios for splitting datasets are 60% for training, 20% for testing, and 20% for validation, but this may vary depending on the size of the dataset and the problem being addressed.

In the context provided, the authors mention fine-tuning specific model parameters to optimize their regression decision tree and random forest models. They also discuss preventing overfitting and minimizing cross-validation error. While they do not explicitly state how they split their data, it can be inferred that they likely followed standard practices for splitting datasets into training, testing, and validation sets to achieve optimal results.
