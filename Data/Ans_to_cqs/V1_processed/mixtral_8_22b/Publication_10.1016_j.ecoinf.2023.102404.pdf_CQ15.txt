Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) being applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, the text does discuss the use of hyperparameter tuning via a grid search method to optimize the performance of a machine learning model.

In the context provided, the focus is primarily on tuning several critical parameters of a machine learning model, including 'numberOfTrees','minLeafPopulation', 'bagFraction', and'seed'. These parameters are related to the Random Forest algorithm, which is an ensemble learning method used for classification and regression tasks.

To tune these parameters, a grid search method was employed. This involves defining a range of potential values for each parameter based on prior knowledge and literature reviews. Then, the grid search exhaustively tests all possible combinations of these values and evaluates the model's performance using cross-validation techniques. The goal is to minimize the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to achieve the most accurate predictions.

While this process can be considered a form of optimization, it differs from traditional optimization techniques like SGD or Adam, which are typically used during the training phase of neural networks to update their weights and biases iteratively. Instead, the grid search method is more about finding the best set of hyperparameters for a given model architecture rather than directly influencing the learning process itself.
