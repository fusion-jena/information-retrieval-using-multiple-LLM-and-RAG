The given information does not explicitly state which cloud platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it mentions that all computations were performed on a PC with 1 GPGPU Nvidia Tesla K80 with 16 GB of RAM. This suggests that the deployment might have been done locally rather than on any specific cloud platform like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform.
