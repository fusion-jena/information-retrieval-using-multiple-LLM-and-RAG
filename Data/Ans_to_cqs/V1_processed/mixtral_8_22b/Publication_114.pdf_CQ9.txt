Unfortunately, the information regarding the availability of the deep learning pipeline's data repository is not explicitly stated within the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific location where the dataset might be found. However, common repositories for such data include platforms like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, and GBIF. It would be best to refer to the original source of the context or contact the authors directly for more accurate information about the data repository.
