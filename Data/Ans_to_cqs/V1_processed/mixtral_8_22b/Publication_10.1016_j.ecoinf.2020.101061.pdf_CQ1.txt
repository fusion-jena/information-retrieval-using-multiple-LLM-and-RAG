In this research, the authors utilize two main methods for collecting raw data in their deep learning pipeline: LiDAR-based unsupervised algorithms and hand-drawn annotations. For pretraining, they generate a large number of tree annotations using a LiDAR-based unsupervised algorithm, which involves overlaying predicted trees onto RGB imagery. This method allows them to create virtually unlimited pretraining data. For training and evaluation purposes, they rely on hand-drawn annotations created by experts. They select different proportions of these hand-annotations to compare with the full dataset, ranging from 5% to 75%. By combining both automated and manual methods for data collection, the researchers aim to overcome the challenge of limited labeled training data typically encountered in ecological contexts.
