The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the study uses Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data and Landsat 8 satellite imagery. These datasets are typically available in various formats such as raster or vector files, which can then be preprocessed into suitable formats like arrays or matrices before being fed into the deep learning model. Additionally, field data is also mentioned, but its exact nature is not specified. It could potentially include measurements stored in structured formats like CSV or Excel files. Therefore, while the precise data formats cannot be determined solely from the provided context, it can be assumed that they involve spatial data formats like raster or vector files along with possibly other structured data formats.
