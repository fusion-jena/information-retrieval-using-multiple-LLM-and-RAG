Unfortunately, based on the given information, there is no mention of where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It does not provide any details about the location or platform (such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket) where the code repository might be hosted. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
