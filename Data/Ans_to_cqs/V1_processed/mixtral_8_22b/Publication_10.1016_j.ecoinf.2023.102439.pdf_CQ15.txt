In the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), or others. However, it does discuss the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and specifically mentions the Nonlinear Autoregressive Exogenous Model (NARX) as part of the deep learning approach.

While not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that some form of optimization technique would have been utilized during the training phase of the ANN model. This could include methods like gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, or adaptive learning rate algorithms like Adam. These techniques help minimize the loss function during training, thereby improving the accuracy of the model.

Moreover, the text refers to the selection of the optimal number of hidden layer neurons to improve the model's performance. This process involves tuning hyperparameters, which is another aspect of optimizing a deep learning model.

However, without more detailed information about the exact implementation of the ANN model, it is impossible to definitively state which optimization techniques were used.
