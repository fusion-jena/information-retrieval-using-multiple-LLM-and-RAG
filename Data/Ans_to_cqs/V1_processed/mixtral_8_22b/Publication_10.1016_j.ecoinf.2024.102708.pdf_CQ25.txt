The purpose of the deep learning models in this study is object detection. Two widely used object detection models were selected for comparison, YOLOv5 (Jocher et al., 2021) and Faster R-CNN (FR-CNN) (Ren et al., 2015). For the YOLOv5 model, they also tested three variants, YOLOv5 small, YOLOv5 medium, and TPH-YOLOv5 (Zhu et al., 2021b), which is a modified variant of YOLO with a Transformer Prediction Head (TPH) (Yang et al., 2019). These models were used to detect Pacific oysters, an invasive species, using drones and remote sensing techniques for ecological management purposes.
