The text does not provide explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, there is mention of creating training samples and extracting landscape types. This suggests that some form of data labeling or annotation has been performed, but the exact technique remains unclear. It could potentially involve bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, or other methods depending on the nature of the dataset and the objectives of the study. Unfortunately, without more detailed information, it is impossible to definitively state which data annotation techniques have been employed.
