Based on the given information, it appears that the methodology used to select the best predictive model involves monitoring its performance during both training and testing phases. During the training phase, several performance metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and others are calculated to evaluate the accuracy of predictions made by different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. It can be observed from Fig. 9 that the majority of these performance indicators were found to be higher during the training period. However, during the testing period, model performance was shown to have greatly improved, possibly due to the issue of underfitting (as mentioned in Table S4 - supplementary data). Additionally, it has been noted that the lowest prediction errors during both training and testing periods belonged to specific ML algorithms like GPR, LR, NN, and SVM. Therefore, it can be concluded that the strategy employed to monitor the model performance during training primarily focuses on evaluating the accuracy of predictions using multiple performance metrics and comparing them across different ML algorithms.
