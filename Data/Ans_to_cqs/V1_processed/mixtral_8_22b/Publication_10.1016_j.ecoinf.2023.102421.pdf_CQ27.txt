Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide a precise answer regarding the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. The given context focuses primarily on the use of XGBoost and LightGBM models for estimating aboveground biomass (AGB) rather than discussing any deep learning models. Furthermore, it does not mention details about the deployment process such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful response to this query based on the current context.
