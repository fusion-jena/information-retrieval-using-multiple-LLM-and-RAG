The text does not provide explicit details about the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that synthetic data was generated using GANs, which could be considered a form of data augmentation. Additionally, the use of pre-trained weights based on the ImageNet dataset suggests that transfer learning was utilized, which can also be seen as a type of data augmentation. Unfortunately, without more specific information, we cannot definitively state what other data augmentation techniques may have been applied in this case.
