The purpose of the deep learning model used in this study is to automatically detect and identify 18 classes of bird species. This is achieved by implementing a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is a type of network inspired by the visual cortex and known for its good performance in object recognition within images. Its application has also been extended to the acoustic domain. The CNN works by organizing its architecture into a hierarchy of layers designed for feature extraction based on a digital image or audio signal. The initial layers can detect basic features such as edges, while deeper layers can learn more complex patterns with higher levels of abstraction.
