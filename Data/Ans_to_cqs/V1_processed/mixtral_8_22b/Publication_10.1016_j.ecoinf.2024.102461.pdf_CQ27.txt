The given context does not provide information about the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate response regarding the specific steps or methods used for deploying the trained deep learning model.

Based on general practices, after training a deep learning model, it is typically serialized into a format suitable for deployment, such as ONNX, TensorFlow Lite, or PyTorch. Once serialized, the model can then be deployed onto a platform like AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, or even edge devices depending on the use case. However, without more specific details from the given context, I am unable to provide a precise answer to the query.
