The query asks about regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, none of the provided contexts directly address this topic. Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages complex models. Two common types of regularization mentioned in the query are dropout and L2 regularization. Dropout randomly drops out neurons during training to prevent overfitting, while L2 regularization adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the weights to the loss function. Other forms of regularization include L1 regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation. Unfortunately, without more relevant context, it is not possible to provide a detailed explanation or examples of these techniques.
