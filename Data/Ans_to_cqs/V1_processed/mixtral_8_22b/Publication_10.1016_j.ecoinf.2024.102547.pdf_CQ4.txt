Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no information about specific data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide general examples of common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. Data augmentation is often employed to increase the amount of training data and improve model performance. Some popular techniques include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, zooming, shearing, and brightness adjustment. These transformations help create new variations of existing data, making models more robust and reducing overfitting. Please note that the choice of appropriate data augmentation techniques depends on the nature of the problem and the type of input data being used.
