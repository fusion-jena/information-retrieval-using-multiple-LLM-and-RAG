The pipeline uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) as its deep learning model. Specifically, four different CNN backbones - ResNet18, VGG16, DenseNet121, and AlexNet - are employed for feature extraction. These CNNs have been pretrained on the ImageNet dataset. However, it should be noted that other types of neural networks, like Deep Neural Networks (DNN) optimized for low power consumption or traditional audio feature extraction methods, could also be explored in the future.
