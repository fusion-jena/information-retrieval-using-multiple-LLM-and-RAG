The pipeline uses various types of deep learning models depending on the approach. In Approach 1, pre-trained deep neural networks such as EfficientNet-B0, ResNet101, MobileNetV2, and InceptionV3 are employed. These are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) designed for image classification tasks. They use convolutional layers to extract features from images and fully connected layers to perform classification based on those extracted features.

On the other hand, Approach 3 utilizes three-layer sequence neural networks primarily composed of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM). These are Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) suitable for processing sequential data like time series or text. They maintain an internal state that captures information about previous elements in the sequence, allowing them to understand temporal dependencies in the data.

Therefore, the pipeline employs both CNNs and RNNs, each serving different purposes according to the requirements of the respective approaches.
