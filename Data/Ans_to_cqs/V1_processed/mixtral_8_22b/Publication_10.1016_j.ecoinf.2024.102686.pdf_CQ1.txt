The paper does not provide specific information on the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it lists various data sources such as Open Spatial Demographic Data and Research, National Meteorological Science Data Center, Harmonized World Soil Database, Resource and Environment Science and Data Center, and Geospatial Data Cloud. These sources likely include both publicly available datasets and data collected through various means like remote sensing, satellite imagery, or ground measurements. For instance, population density data might be obtained from census records or demographic surveys, while climatic conditions could be derived from meteorological stations or weather satellites. Land use intensity may involve analyzing land cover maps generated by remote sensing techniques. Nevertheless, the exact methods employed for gathering these data points are not explicitly mentioned in this study.
