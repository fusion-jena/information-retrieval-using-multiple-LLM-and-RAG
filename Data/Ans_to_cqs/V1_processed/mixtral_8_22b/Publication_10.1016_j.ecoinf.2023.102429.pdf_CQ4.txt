The paper does not provide information on the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based on the given context.

Based on the provided context, it appears that the study focuses on spectral analysis and pre-processing methods such as R/PLSR, SG/PLSR, SG-FD/PLSR, SG-SD/PLSR, SG-MSC/PLSR, and SG-RL/PLSR. The table also lists important bands for TN estimation using these methods. However, there is no mention of any data augmentation techniques or deep learning pipelines in the given context.
