Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide the exact code repository link of the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context. However, considering that the paper uses TensorFlow and Keras for implementing neural networks, it would be reasonable to look for related repositories on platforms like GitHub or GitLab. You could search for keywords such as 'phenology prediction', 'Bayesian deep learning', 'Monte Carlo Dropout', 'VBI approach', etc., along with 'TensorFlow' and 'Keras'. This might help you find relevant projects or repositories containing the desired deep learning pipelines.
