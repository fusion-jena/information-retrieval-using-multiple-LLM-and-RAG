The text does not provide explicit information on the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of'seasonal images' as input variables for machine learning classification models. This suggests that one of the data formats used could be images. Additionally, the mention of'multisource data' implies that there might be other types of data used, but without further context, we cannot definitively determine what those data formats might be.
