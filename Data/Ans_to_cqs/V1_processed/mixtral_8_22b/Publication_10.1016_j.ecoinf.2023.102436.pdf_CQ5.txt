The provided context does not mention any specific dataset used in a deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it discusses various studies related to landscape analysis and planning using different techniques including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and image-based methods. These studies focus on analyzing and tracking landscape change, assessing visual quality, and facilitating landscape planning and design. Therefore, it can be assumed that the datasets used in these studies might include landscape photographs, satellite imagery, or other relevant data sources depending on the research objectives and methodologies employed.
