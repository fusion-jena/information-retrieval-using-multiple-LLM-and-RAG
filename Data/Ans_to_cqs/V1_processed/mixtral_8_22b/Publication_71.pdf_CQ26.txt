When dealing with imbalanced datasets in deep learning, several techniques can be employed to address data bias during preprocessing. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and validation sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes in both sets. This ensures that the model learns from a representative sample of each class, reducing the risk of bias towards overrepresented classes.

Oversampling is a technique where synthetic samples are generated from the minority class to balance the dataset. This can be done by duplicating existing samples or creating new ones through interpolation or extrapolation. Oversampling helps increase the representation of the minority class, making it easier for the model to learn its features.

Undersampling, on the other hand, involves removing samples from the majority class to achieve a balanced dataset. While this reduces the overall size of the dataset, it can help prevent the model from being overwhelmed by the majority class. Undersampling should be used carefully, however, as it can lead to information loss if too many samples are removed.

Diverse data collection is another approach to addressing data bias. By collecting data from various sources and environments, it becomes possible to capture a wider range of variations within each class. This can improve the generalizability of the model and reduce the impact of any inherent biases in individual datasets.

In addition to these techniques, augmenting the training dataset using different brightness levels, adding vertically and horizontally flipped versions, shifting, rotating, or adding noisy versions of the training images can also help mitigate the issues when test data characteristics differ from the training data.

Overall, there are several techniques available to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The choice of which technique(s) to use will depend on factors such as the nature of the dataset, the specific application, and the resources available.
