Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps used after the model training. However, common practices for postprocessing include calculating metrics such as accuracy rates, skill measures, and root mean square errors (RMS). These can be seen in Table 7 under the Results section with values for Training RMS, Testing RMS, Accuracy Rate, and Skill Measure (%). Additionally, confusion matrices could have been created but aren't explicitly mentioned. Saliency maps also aren't discussed in this context. In summary, based on the available information, the postprocessing steps likely included calculating various metrics like accuracy rates, skill measures, and RMS errors.
