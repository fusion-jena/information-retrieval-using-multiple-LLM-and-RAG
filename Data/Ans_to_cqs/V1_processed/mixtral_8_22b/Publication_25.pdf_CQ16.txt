The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does discuss various aspects related to improving models through different types of data and methods such as self-supervision, hand-annotations, and semi-supervised learning. In machine learning, common criteria used to determine when training is complete include reaching a certain number of epochs, achieving a desired level of accuracy or loss, or observing a plateau in validation loss. Without explicit information from the provided context, these general criteria can be considered as potential answers to the query.
