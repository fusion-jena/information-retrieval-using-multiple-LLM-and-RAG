The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrices. However, it does describe some actions taken after training the model. After splitting the data into k-folds, the model is trained on the tuning set with a certain number of iterations. Then, predictions are made using the validation set, and the out-of-sample R^2 is calculated. This process is repeated for each number of iterations, and the median of the k-1 out-of-sample R^2 values is used to select the best number of iterations. Finally, a matrix of these medians is returned for each fold and each number of iterations. These steps can be considered part of the postprocessing phase since they involve evaluating the performance of the model after training.
