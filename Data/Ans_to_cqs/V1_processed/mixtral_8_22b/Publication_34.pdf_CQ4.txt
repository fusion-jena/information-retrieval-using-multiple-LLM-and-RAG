In the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, scaling, etc. However, the text does provide information about the structure and components of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) used in the study.

The CNN described consists of two hidden convolutional layers and one final layer fully connected with 200 neurons. The first layer has 64 convolution filters with a kernel size of (3, 3) and 1 line of 0 padding. The resulting feature maps are batch normalized and transformed with a rectified linear unit (ReLU). An average pooling operation with a (8, 8) kernel and (8, 8) stride is then applied.

The second layer comprises 128 convolution filters with a kernel size of (5, 5) and 2 lines of padding, followed by batch normalization and ReLU activation. Another average pooling operation with a (8, 8) kernel and (8, 8) stride is performed to reduce the size of the 128 feature maps to one pixel. These pixels are then collected into a vector through a flattening operation before being fed into the fully connected layer.

While this description provides valuable insights into the CNN architecture, it does not discuss any data augmentation techniques employed during the training process. Therefore, without additional context, it is impossible to determine what data augmentation methods, if any, were utilized in the deep learning pipeline.
