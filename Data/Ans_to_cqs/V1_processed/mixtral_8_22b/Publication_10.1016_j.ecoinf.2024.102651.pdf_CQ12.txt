The pipeline uses a hybrid deep learning model called CA-Hybrid network, which combines Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures. This network is specifically designed for Cervidae classification and utilizes Class Activation Map (CAM) within its residual structure to focus more on critical features, enhancing the model's generalization ability. The CA-Hybrid network leverages the strengths of both CNN and ViT models; while CNN excels in local information extraction and addressing degradation problems in deep networks, ViT contributes to extracting richer semantic features.
