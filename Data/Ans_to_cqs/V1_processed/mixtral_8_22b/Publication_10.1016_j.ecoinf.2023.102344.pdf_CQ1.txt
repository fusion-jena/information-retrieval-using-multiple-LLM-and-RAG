The given context does not provide explicit details about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, we can infer that the raw data collected for the deep learning models mentioned are primarily images related to molluscs. These images could be obtained through various means such as underwater cameras, drones, or even publicly available datasets. It is also stated that the images were used for detecting illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, suggesting that they might have been captured in marine environments. Nevertheless, without more precise information regarding the data collection process, it would be speculative to definitively state the exact methodologies employed for gathering the raw data.
