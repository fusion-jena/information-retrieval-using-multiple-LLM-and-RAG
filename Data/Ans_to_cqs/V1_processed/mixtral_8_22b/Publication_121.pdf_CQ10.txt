Unfortunately, there isn't enough context provided to give a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline mentioned in this study. However, it can be noted that the authors have used Android Studio for developing their mobile application and TensorFlow Lite for deploying the deep learning models onto the mobile platform. It would be best to contact the authors directly if more detailed information about the code repository is required.
