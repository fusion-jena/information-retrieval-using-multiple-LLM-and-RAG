The paper uses several metrics to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, specifically the Bird's Eye View (BEV) Faster Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) algorithm. These metrics include True Positives (TP), False Negatives (FN), False Positives (FP), Recall (R), Precision (P), and F-score (F). The number of trees in each stand density is also reported.

True positives (TP) refer to the correctly identified trees, while false negatives (FN) are the missed trees, and false positives (FP) are the incorrectly identified trees. Recall (R), also known as sensitivity or true positive rate, measures the proportion of actual positives that were correctly identified. It is calculated as TP / (TP + FN). Precision (P), also called positive predictive value, measures the proportion of true positives among all predicted positives. It is calculated as TP / (TP + FP). The F-score (F) is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both. It is calculated as (2 * P * R) / (P + R).

These metrics help assess the effectiveness of the deep learning model in accurately identifying and classifying trees within different stand densities.
