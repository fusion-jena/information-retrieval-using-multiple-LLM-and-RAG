To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting is a technique where the dataset is divided into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes or labels in both sets. This ensures that the model does not become biased towards any particular class due to unequal representation.

Oversampling is another method used to balance datasets with imbalanced classes. In this approach, samples from the minority class are duplicated until they reach equal representation with the majority class. However, this may lead to overfitting if not handled carefully.

Undersampling involves reducing the number of samples in the majority class so that it matches the size of the minority class. While this helps achieve balanced classes, it could result in loss of valuable information since fewer examples are available for training.

Lastly, collecting diverse data is crucial to ensure that the model generalizes well across different scenarios. By gathering data from various sources, demographics, environments, etc., we can minimize potential biases introduced by limited or homogeneous datasets.

In summary, addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline requires careful consideration of methods such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Each technique has its advantages and disadvantages, making it essential to choose the most suitable one based on specific requirements and constraints.
