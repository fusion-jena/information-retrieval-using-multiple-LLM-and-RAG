Unfortunately, there isn't enough context to provide a direct link to the data repository of the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the paper. The Bloomberg Data for Good 2015 link provided does not seem to contain any relevant information regarding the deep learning pipeline or its associated data repositories. It would be best to refer directly to the original research paper titled "Deep Learning for Large Scale Biodiversity Monitoring" published in September 2015 by David J. Klein, Matthew W. McKown, and Bernie R. Tershy. However, without access to the full text of the article, I cannot confirm if they have shared their dataset or code in a public repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
