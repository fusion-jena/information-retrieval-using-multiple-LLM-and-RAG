The text mentions that a PC with Windows 10 operating system, a GPU card (RTX2070), and 16GB memory is used for DeepLabv3+ model training and testing. Therefore, it can be concluded that the hardware resource used for training the deep learning model is a GPU (specifically, an RTX2070). No mention is made of any other type of hardware accelerator, such as TPUs.
