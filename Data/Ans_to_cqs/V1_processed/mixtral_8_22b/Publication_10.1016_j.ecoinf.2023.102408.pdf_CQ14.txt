For the Random Forest (RF) model, the hyperparameter'mtry' was systematically evaluated from 1 to 10 to find a balance between stability and minimizing the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). However, the specific optimization technique used, whether it be grid search, random search, or another method, is not explicitly stated in the given context.

Regarding the Artificial Neural Network (ANN), the hyperparameters'size' and 'decay' were set as arrays of 1-20 and 0.025-1, respectively. Again, the exact optimization technique employed is not mentioned in the provided text.

Lastly, for the Support Vector Machine (SVM), the parameter 'c' was utilized to address the overfitting issue by optimizing the line fit and penalizing the number of samples within the margin. Nevertheless, the optimization approach for selecting the optimal value of 'c' remains unspecified in the given context.
