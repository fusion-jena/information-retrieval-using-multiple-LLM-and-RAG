In the field of ecological research, various methods are used to collect raw data for use in deep learning pipelines. These include aerial surveys, bird surveys, and underwater imagery, among others.

Aerial surveys are a common method used to gather environmental information across large areas quickly and efficiently. However, these surveys must be conducted carefully to ensure reliable data collection (Davis et al., 2022). Standardized and well-structured long-term data collection methods are ideal for measuring changes in ecology but can be expensive and resource-intensive (Clements & Robinson, 2022).

Bird surveys are another method used to collect ecological data. These surveys involve observing and recording bird populations and behaviors in their natural habitats. This type of data collection requires specialized knowledge and expertise in avian species identification and behavior analysis (Bibby et al., 1998).

Underwater imagery is also commonly used to collect data on marine environments. This can include the use of cameras, robots, and sonography to capture images and video footage of underwater structures and organisms. Contour-based feature analysis methods have been developed to distinguish between man-made objects and natural elements in underwater environments (Abu & Diamant, 2022).

Supervised machine learning and deep learning techniques have also been employed to analyze and interpret ecological data. For example, deep learning algorithms such as LCSE-ResNet have been used to detect, classify, and locate specific types of marine man-made objects based on remote optical imagery (Han et al., 2022).

Publicly available datasets can also serve as valuable sources of raw data for deep learning pipelines. These datasets often contain preprocessed and labeled data that can save researchers significant time and resources compared to collecting and labeling data themselves. Examples of publicly available datasets relevant to ecological research include those containing satellite imagery, weather data, and wildlife population statistics.
