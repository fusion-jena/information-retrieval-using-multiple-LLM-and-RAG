The method used to optimize the hyperparameters of the model is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, it can be inferred from the use of Akaike Information Criterion corrected for small sample sizes (AICc) that a form of model selection or optimization was employed. This criterion helps select the most parsimonious model among several competing ones by balancing goodness-of-fit and complexity. In this case, the model with the lowest AICc value (i.e., ΔAICc = 0) was considered the best model. All models with ΔAICc < 2 were generally considered to have substantial support. Therefore, it appears that some sort of iterative process was used to evaluate different combinations of hyperparameters until the optimal set was found based on the AICc score. Unfortunately, without more specific information about the methods used, it cannot be definitively stated whether grid search, random search, or another technique was utilized.
