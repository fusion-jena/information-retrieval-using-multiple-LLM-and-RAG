The given context does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, we can infer that the optimization might involve techniques such as grid search or random search, which are commonly used methods for hyperparameter tuning in machine learning models. Grid search involves trying out all possible combinations of hyperparameters within a manually specified range, while random search randomly selects values from predefined ranges for each hyperparameter. Both methods aim to find the best combination of hyperparameters that minimizes the loss function or maximizes the performance metric of interest. In the absence of specific details regarding the optimization method employed in the given context, one cannot definitively state whether grid search, random search, or another approach was utilized.
