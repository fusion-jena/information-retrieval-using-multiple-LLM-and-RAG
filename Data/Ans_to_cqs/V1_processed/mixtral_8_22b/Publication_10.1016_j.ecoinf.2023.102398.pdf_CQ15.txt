The optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline for this particular case is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). This method is used for training the model, as stated in the given context. SGD is a popular optimization algorithm widely used in machine learning and deep learning models due to its simplicity and efficiency. It works by updating the parameters of the model iteratively based on the gradient of the loss function with respect to those parameters. However, other optimization algorithms such as Adam or RMSprop could have also been used depending on the specific requirements and characteristics of the problem being addressed.
