The text does not provide explicit details about specific preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it mentions some important aspects related to preparing the data for training a deep learning model. One crucial step mentioned is data augmentation, which involves increasing the number and variability of the training data by applying modifications to the original images. This includes operations such as rotation, flipping horizontally and vertically, shifting width and height ranges, applying shear transformations, zooming, and adjusting brightness ranges. These techniques help improve the robustness and generalizability of the model by exposing it to diverse variations of the input data during training. Additionally, the text discusses the use of a standard machine learning hyperparameter search, involving factors like the activation function, optimizer, and learning rate. It also mentions the implementation of early stopping to prevent overfitting, where training stops when the validation error diverges from the training error, thus saving the model with the best performance.
