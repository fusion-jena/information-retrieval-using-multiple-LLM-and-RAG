Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of any specific deep learning framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch being used to build the deep learning model. However, it does state that an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model was utilized, specifically a Nonlinear Autoregressive Exogenous Model (NARX) which is a type of recurrent neural network. This suggests that some form of machine learning library or framework would have been required to implement this model, but without further details, we cannot definitively identify which one was used.
