The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that one method used for gathering data is through the sampling of more than 100 permanent sample plots over 20 years. Additionally, the context mentions the use of a fungal database, which suggests that publicly available datasets or databases might also have been employed. Unfortunately, without further information, it cannot be determined if other methods like surveys or sensors were used.
