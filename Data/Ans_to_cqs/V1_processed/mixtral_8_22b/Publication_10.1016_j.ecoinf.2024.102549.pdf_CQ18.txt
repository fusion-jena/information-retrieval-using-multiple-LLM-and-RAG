The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves setting parameters and using specific techniques. The parameters set include a kernel size of 3, stride of 1, and a dropout rate of 50%. The dropout function is used between the fully connected layers to enhance model reliability. Training is conducted over 500 epochs with a momentum of 0.9 and an initial learning rate of 10, which is halved every 20 rounds to optimize performance. This process helps select the most effective model weights for each cycle.
