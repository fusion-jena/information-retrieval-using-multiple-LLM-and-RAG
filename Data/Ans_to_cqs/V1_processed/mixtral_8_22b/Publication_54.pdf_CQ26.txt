Based on the provided context, there isn't explicit information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, the text does mention that Section II focuses on data acquisition and preprocessing to overcome imbalanced and data overfitting. This suggests that some form of balancing technique might be employed, but without further details, it cannot be confirmed which exact methods are utilized.
