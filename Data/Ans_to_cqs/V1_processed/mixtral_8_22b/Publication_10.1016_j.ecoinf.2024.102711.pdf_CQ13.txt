The text does not provide information about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model. However, it mentions that the hyperparameters used in the Random Forest and XGBoost models include maximum depth, n\_estimators, and learning rate. The table provides specific values for these hyperparameters for both binary and multi-class classification tasks. Additionally, the text discusses the use of grid search to evaluate the performance of the data-driven model with different combinations of predefined hyperparameters and identify the best ones. It also mentions that the maximum depth of the tree, the number of trees in the ensemble model, and the learning rate are tuned as the influential hyperparameters in this study.
