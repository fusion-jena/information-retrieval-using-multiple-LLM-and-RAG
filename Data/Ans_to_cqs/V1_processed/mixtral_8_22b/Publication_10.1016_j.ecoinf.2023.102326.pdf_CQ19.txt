The given context does not provide information about which framework was used to build the deep learning model. However, it mentions that all analyses were performed using Python 3.8.5 and corresponding packages. Therefore, it can be assumed that one of the popular deep learning libraries compatible with Python such as TensorFlow or PyTorch might have been used, but without explicit mention, it cannot be confirmed.
