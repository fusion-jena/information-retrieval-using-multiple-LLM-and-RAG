The information regarding the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to where it might be available, e.g., GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. It would require additional resources or references to determine its location.

Based on the context provided, we can see that there are several studies and methods discussed related to machine learning tasks, specifically focusing on low-data contexts and few-shot learning tasks within the field of computational bioacoustics. However, none of these sources mention any details about the availability of their respective code repositories.

To find out more about the code repository of the deep learning pipeline, one could look for further publications by the authors mentioned in the context, such as Liu et al. (2019), Wang et al. (2022), Stowell (2021), Nolasco et al. (2023), and McEwen et al. (2023b). Additionally, checking the reference sections of these papers may lead to other relevant works containing links to the desired code repositories.
