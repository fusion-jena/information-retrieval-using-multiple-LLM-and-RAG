The text does not provide explicit information on the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. However, it discusses several architectures like EfficientNet-B0, ResNet101, MobileNetV2, and InceptionV3, which can be implemented using various deep learning libraries including TensorFlow and PyTorch. Therefore, without additional context, we cannot definitively determine which frameworks were employed to construct these deep learning models.
