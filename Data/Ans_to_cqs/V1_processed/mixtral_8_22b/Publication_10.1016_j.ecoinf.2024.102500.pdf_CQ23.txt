To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were implemented. Firstly, a diverse dataset was utilized, which included data on various water quality parameters (WQPs), such as nitrates and dissolved oxygen (DO). This diversity in the dataset helped to create a robust model capable of handling different types of input data. Secondly, cross-validation techniques were employed to evaluate the model's performance and select optimal hyperparameters. Specifically, fivefold cross-validation was applied, where the dataset was divided into five equal-sized folds. Each fold served as a validation set once while the remaining folds formed the training set. This approach allowed for a more comprehensive model performance analysis by averaging coefficients of determination (R^2) or root mean square errors (RMSE) across five iterations with five folds. Lastly, stratified splitting was not explicitly mentioned; however, the use of subsamples and controlling local pattern sensitivities through min\_child\_samples helped reduce overfitting and improved the model's ability to generalize well to unseen data.
