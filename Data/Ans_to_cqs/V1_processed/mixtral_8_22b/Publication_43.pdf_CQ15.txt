In the given context, it is mentioned that the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is commonly used to update the weights in Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This technique is employed during the fine-tuning process of networks like ResNet and GoogLeNet. These networks are initially trained using the ImageNet dataset, but their weights are updated to adapt them to new datasets or specific problems.

The equation provided for updating the weights is:

wt+1 = µwt - α∆J(wt)

Here, wt represents the current weights, µ is the momentum weight, α is the learning rate, and ∆J(wt) denotes the gradient of the loss function J with respect to the current weights.

Although the context does not explicitly discuss other optimization techniques like Adam, it focuses primarily on the use of SGD in the deep learning pipeline. However, it should be noted that various optimization methods exist beyond those mentioned here, including Adam, Adagrad, and RMSprop, among others. Each method has its own strengths and weaknesses, making them more or less suitable for certain applications.
