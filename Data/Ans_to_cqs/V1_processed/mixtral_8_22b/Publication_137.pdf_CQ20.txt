The experiment was conducted using Ubuntu 16.0 as the experimental platform, with 32GB of memory and an NVIDIA RTX 2070 GPU. This indicates that the deep learning model was trained using a GPU for processing power. No mention of other specialized hardware such as TPUs or FPGAs was made, suggesting that these were not utilized in the experiment.
