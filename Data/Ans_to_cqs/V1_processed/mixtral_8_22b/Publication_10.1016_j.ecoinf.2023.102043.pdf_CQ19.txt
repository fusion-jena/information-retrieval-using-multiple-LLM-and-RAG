Based on the given context, it is not explicitly stated which specific deep learning frameworks were used to build the models. However, since Python packages like librosa were utilized for processing the audio data, it can be inferred that popular Python-based deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch might have been used for building the deep learning models. Nevertheless, without explicit mention of these frameworks in the provided context, I cannot provide a definitive answer.
