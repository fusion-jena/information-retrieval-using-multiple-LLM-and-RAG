In the given context, two main hyperparameters are mentioned for the deep learning models - learning rate and batch size. Additionally, dropout is also briefly mentioned as another hyperparameter.

The learning rate is a crucial hyperparameter that controls how much the weights of the network should change during training. A lower learning rate might cause slower convergence or getting stuck in local minima, while a higher learning rate might lead to unstable training or missing global minima.

Batch size refers to the number of samples processed before updating the internal model parameters. Larger batch sizes provide smoother gradient estimates but require more memory, whereas smaller batch sizes offer noisier gradients but use less memory and can generalize better.

Dropout is a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting in neural networks. By randomly setting some neurons to zero during training, dropout helps reduce co-dependency between neurons and encourages them to learn independently useful features.

These hyperparameters play significant roles in determining the overall performance of the deep learning models. However, keep in mind that there are many other hyperparameters like optimizers, activation functions, number of layers, etc., that can impact the model's performance.
