The pipeline uses a deep learning model called YOLOv5, which stands for You Only Look Once version 5. This model is a single-stage detector built upon the concept of anchor boxes and is primarily used for object detection tasks. It belongs to the family of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and is specifically designed for real-time processing. YOLOv5 has several improvements over its predecessors, such as a more efficient architecture, better performance, and support for transfer learning. It also includes features like mosaic data augmentation, adaptive image filling, and auto-learning bounding box anchors.
