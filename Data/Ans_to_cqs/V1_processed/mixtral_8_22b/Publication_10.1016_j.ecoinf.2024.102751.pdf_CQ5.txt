Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in a deep learning pipeline. However, the text does discuss the use of satellite data, specifically from the PlanetScope constellation of satellites. These satellites provide multispectral imagery with four spectral bands: red, green, blue, and infrared, at a spatial resolution of 3.7 meters at the nadir. The study uses this satellite data to develop a predictive model for estimating Volumetric Water Content (VWC) in reclaimed areas of hard coal mines. Therefore, while not explicitly stated, we can infer that the dataset used in their deep learning pipeline would likely consist of this multispectral satellite imagery.
