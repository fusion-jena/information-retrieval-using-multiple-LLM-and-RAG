The text does not explicitly state which method was used for hyperparameter optimization, but it mentions that the hyperparameter tuning has been performed for all nine prediction models. This suggests that some form of hyperparameter optimization was indeed carried out. However, without further information, it cannot be definitively stated whether methods like grid search or random search were employed.

Based on the given context, it appears that the hyperparameters were optimized through a process involving the use of performance metrics, a test set, and possibly cross-validation. The performance metrics mentioned in Section 2.5 were likely used to evaluate the effectiveness of different hyperparameter configurations. After evaluating these metrics, the most effective models for each target variable were chosen. It is also noted that a visual representation of this model selection process is available in Figure 4.

Additionally, Table 4 provides more specific details about the hyperparameters used for each prediction model, including those selected during the 5-fold cross-validation and any adjustments made according to the selection criteria. While this table offers valuable insights into the final hyperparameters used for each model, it does not provide explicit information regarding the optimization method itself.

In conclusion, while the text indicates that hyperparameter optimization took place, it does not specify the exact method used, such as grid search or random search.
