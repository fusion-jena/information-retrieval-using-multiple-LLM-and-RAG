The information provided does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the authors utilize existing datasets such as AnuraSet, which may have been collected through various means like field recordings using microphones or other audio recording devices. Additionally, they employ several pre-trained models like BirdNet, VGGish, YAMNet, VGG16, and ResNet152-V2 for generating data representations. These models were likely trained on large-scale datasets, but the exact sources of these datasets are not mentioned in the given context.
