Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the models were trained on a small subset of the training data and validated using a left-out validation data set. It also discusses the use of deep learning models for disease vector abundance prediction, specifically mentioning their ability to use time series directly as predictors. Therefore, while I cannot provide the exact datasets used, it can be inferred that they likely involved time series data related to disease vector abundance or similar applications.
