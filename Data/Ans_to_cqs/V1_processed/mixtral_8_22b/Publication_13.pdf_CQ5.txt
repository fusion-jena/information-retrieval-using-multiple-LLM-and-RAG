Three main datasets were used in this study: Global High Quality (GH), Local High Quality (LH), and Local Low Quality (LL). The GH dataset consists of high-quality images obtained from various sources such as museum collections and online databases. The LH dataset contains high-quality images taken by professional photographers specifically for this project. Lastly, the LL dataset includes lower-quality images captured using a conventional stereoscope microscope camera.

The purpose of these datasets is to evaluate the performance of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model under different scenarios. For instance, one scenario involves using a global image database (GH) to predict local samples (LH and LL), while another scenario focuses on predicting local high-resolution images (LL) based on single-specimen photographs taken by local taxonomists (LH). Additionally, the study employs Domain Adversarial Training of Neural Networks (DANN) to incorporate some unknown targets into the model, aiming to reduce the large accuracy gap between source and target datasets.
