The text does not explicitly state what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline. However, it mentions several types of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), such as ResNet, RepVGG, and MobileNet-V3. These models are used as backbone networks for their experiments. Therefore, it can be inferred that the authors likely used one or more of these CNN architectures in their pipeline.
