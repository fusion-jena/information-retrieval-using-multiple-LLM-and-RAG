Based on the given information, there is no direct mention or indication of how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. The text only provides details about a racy assessment requiring certain parameters for calculating training samples, different seasons, dates, and some values that seem unrelated to the optimization process. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether grid search, random search, or any other method was used for hyperparameter optimization based solely on this information.
