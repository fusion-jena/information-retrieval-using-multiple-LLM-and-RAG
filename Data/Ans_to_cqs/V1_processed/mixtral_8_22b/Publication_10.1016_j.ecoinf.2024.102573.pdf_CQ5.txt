Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that recent years have seen impressive progress in bird species recognition and related tasks using deep learning methods. Additionally, it discusses the use of an EfficientNet-B0 backend neural network classifier from the official implementation of TorchVision, which keeps the experiments consistent with prior works, reproducible, and accessible.
