The authors took several measures to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model. Firstly, they employed a technique called transfer learning, which involves fine-tuning a pre-trained model on a new task. In this case, they used a ResNet-50 network architecture, which had been previously trained on the ImageNet dataset. Despite the fact that the ImageNet dataset did not contain any similar objects to those in their study, the network still performed well. This suggests that the features learned from the ImageNet dataset were useful for their specific task.

Secondly, they used a process called data augmentation, which involves creating new training examples by applying transformations such as rotation or scaling to existing examples. This helps to increase the diversity of the dataset and reduce overfitting.

Thirdly, they used a technique called dropout, which randomly drops out neurons during training to prevent overfitting.

Finally, they ensured that their dataset was representative of the population by performing stratified sampling. They divided their dataset into two parts: 80% for training and 20% for validation. Importantly, this division was done per category (chironomid taxa), ensuring that each category was represented equally in both the training and validation datasets.

Overall, these measures helped to ensure that the deep learning model was able to generalize well to unseen data.
