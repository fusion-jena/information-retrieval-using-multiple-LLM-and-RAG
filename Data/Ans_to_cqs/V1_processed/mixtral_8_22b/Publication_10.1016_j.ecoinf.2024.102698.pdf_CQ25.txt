The purpose of the deep learning model used in generating the synthetic connectivity data is to create a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model. The goal of this GAN model is to replicate the sparseness of the original connectivity matrices and perform well in terms of utility metrics. The GAN model consists of two components: a generator and a discriminator. The generator learns the latent features of the data to generate a data sample, while the discriminator is a classification model that learns to classify real and synthetic data. Through backpropagation from the discriminator, the model parameters in the generator are updated, with the magnitude of the update depending on the success of the discriminator in classifying the data.

Additionally, another deep learning model, a TVAE model from SDV, is used to develop the initial coral cover model. This model is based on a Variational Autoencoder model, where an encoder maps the original data to distributions in a lower dimensional latent space. Data is then sampled from the latent space and transformed back to the original space using a decoder. During the learning phase, the decoder learns by finding a transformation with minimal loss between the original and final data distributions. The model aims to learn the spatially dependent distribution of cover for each of the six species of coral modelled in ADRIA.
