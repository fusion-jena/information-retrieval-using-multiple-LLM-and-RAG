The text does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, based on common practices in deep learning, some possible criteria include reaching a certain number of epochs, achieving a desired level of performance on a validation dataset, observing a plateau in the validation loss, or meeting other predefined stopping conditions. It should also be noted that the goal of training is to minimize overfitting while maximizing the model's ability to generalize well to unseen data.
