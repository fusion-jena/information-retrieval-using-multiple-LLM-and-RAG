The text does not provide specific information about the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it mentions that a deep learning model was used to classify three sympatric otter species, where a model trained on images of all qualities was only marginally outperformed by a model trained on high-quality prints. This suggests that the deep learning model could be a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is commonly used for image classification tasks. Nevertheless, without explicit confirmation, we cannot definitively determine the exact type of deep learning model employed in the pipeline.
