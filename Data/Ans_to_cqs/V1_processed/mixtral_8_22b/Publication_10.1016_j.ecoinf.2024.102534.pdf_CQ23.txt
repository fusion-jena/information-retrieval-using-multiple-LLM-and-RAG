The given context does not provide explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that some form of validation has been performed based on the mention of "Validation" under several authors' contributions. Additionally, the use of "Area Under Curve (AUC)" and "True Skill Statistics (TSS)" suggests that the model's performance was evaluated using these metrics. It is also mentioned that the data was used to validate model predictions. Nevertheless, there are no direct references to specific techniques such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, without further context, it cannot be definitively stated what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
