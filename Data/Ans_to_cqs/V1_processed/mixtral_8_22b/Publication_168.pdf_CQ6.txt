Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific preprocessing steps taken before training a deep learning model. However, common practices in preparing datasets for deep learning models include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization can help bring all features to the same level of magnitude, which is crucial when using distance-based algorithms or when inputs vary significantly in scale. Scaling involves transforming the range of independent variables or predictors to a certain standard scale, often between zero and one. Cleaning refers to handling missing values, outliers, and noise in the dataset. These preprocessing techniques aim to improve the quality and efficiency of the machine learning algorithm.
