The context does not provide information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or managing random seed values. However, there are several common strategies used to manage randomness in deep learning pipelines. One strategy is to set a specific seed value for reproducibility purposes, ensuring that results can be reproduced across different runs. Another strategy is to perform multiple runs with different seeds and average the results to reduce variability caused by random initialization. Additionally, some researchers may choose to use deterministic algorithms instead of stochastic ones to eliminate sources of randomness altogether.
