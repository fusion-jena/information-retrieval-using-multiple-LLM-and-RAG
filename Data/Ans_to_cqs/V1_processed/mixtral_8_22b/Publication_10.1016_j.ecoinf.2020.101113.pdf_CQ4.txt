Based on the given context, the specific data augmentation technique applied in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned. However, there is a reference to 'noise addition' as a form of data augmentation. This technique involves adding artificial noise to the existing data samples to create new ones, thereby increasing the amount of training data available. It is also suggested that data augmentation may help emulate the conditions of soundscape recordings, implying that the original data might have been recorded under controlled conditions. Furthermore, the text suggests that data augmentation may be necessary to increase the training data size for rare species. Therefore, while the exact techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling are not specified, it can be inferred that some form of data augmentation, specifically noise addition, has been applied in the deep learning pipeline.
