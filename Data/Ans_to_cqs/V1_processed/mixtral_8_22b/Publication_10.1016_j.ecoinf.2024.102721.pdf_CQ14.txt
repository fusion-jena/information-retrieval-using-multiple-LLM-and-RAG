The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using Bayesian Optimization (BO). Unlike traditional methods such as grid search or random search, BO uses a more efficient approach by leveraging past evaluations of the target function to guide future searches. This method is particularly useful when dealing with a large number of hyperparameters due to its ability to handle non-linear interactions between them. By estimating the posterior distribution of the target function, BO constructs a provisional surrogate function. This function is then minimized to determine the next set of hyperparameters to evaluate. In this study, Gaussian processes are chosen as the probabilistic agent model for BO. These processes are commonly used in non-linear regression, classification, and other fields. They provide a way to estimate the prediction error of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model with different hyperparameters. Through iterative computation of BO and continuous updating of the prior probabilities, the agent model approximates the objective function.
