Based on the given context, there isn't explicit mention of specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model such as using diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, the text does discuss some techniques used to evaluate and improve the performance of a machine learning model, specifically a covariance-weighted bagging approach.

One method mentioned for evaluating the model's performance is out-of-bag validation. This technique involves obtaining out-of-bag predictions for each simulated data point during the bagging process by predicting the values at the data points that were not selected for each bootstrap sample. These predicted values are then averaged across all samples to provide an overall measure of the model's accuracy.

Additionally, the context mentions comparing the results of the covariance-weighted bagging approach to other methods, including random forests, gradient boosting machines, support vector regression, and linear models. Benchmarking the performance of the proposed method against multiple alternative methods can help demonstrate its robustness and applicability across different types of data and modeling tasks.

While these evaluation strategies do contribute to understanding the model's performance and potential biases, they do not directly address the issue of ensuring the generalizability of the deep learning model through diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, I cannot definitively state what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
