The paper by Chalmers et al. (2021) discusses using deep learning models for modelling animal biodiversity through acoustic monitoring. However, it does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in their deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide information on the exact values of the learning rate or the optimizer used in this study. It is recommended to refer directly to the original publication for more detailed information regarding the implementation of their deep learning approach.
