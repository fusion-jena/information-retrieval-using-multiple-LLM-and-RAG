The papers mentioned do not explicitly discuss regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, two related techniques are discussed: MixUp and CutMix. These techniques are used to improve generalization and robustness during training. MixUp (Zhang et al., 2017) creates new samples by linearly combining existing ones, while CutMix (Yun et al., 2019) replaces part of one input image with another. Both methods help reduce overfitting by increasing the diversity of training examples.
