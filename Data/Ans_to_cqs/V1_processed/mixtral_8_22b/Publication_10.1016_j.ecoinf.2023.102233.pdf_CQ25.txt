The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the model is designed for identifying or classifying calls of the southern black-throated finch. This is supported by the mention of "call recognition" and "identifying calls" in relation to the model. Additionally, the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) suggests that the model is likely being used for image or signal processing tasks such as classification or object detection.
