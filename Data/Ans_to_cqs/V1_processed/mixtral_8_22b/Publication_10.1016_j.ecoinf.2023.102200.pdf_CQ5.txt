The given context does not provide specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it mentions several studies related to remote sensing, machine learning, and deep learning techniques applied to various types of data like Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) imagery, Airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. These studies focus on tasks such as wetland classification, mangrove crown diameter measurement, tree canopy segmentation, brain tumor image segmentation, and individual maize segmentation. The context also includes a figure and a table presenting segmentation results based on LiDAR data using the Bird's Eye View (BEV) Faster Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) algorithm. Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention any well-known datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, it discusses various applications of deep learning techniques in processing diverse types of remote sensing data.
