Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model. However, generally speaking, common preprocessing techniques include data normalization, scaling, cleaning, and augmentation. Data normalization involves transforming the data so that it falls within a specific range, such as between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. Scaling involves adjusting the scale of the data to prevent certain features from dominating others during training. Cleaning involves removing noise, outliers, and missing values from the dataset. Augmentation involves creating additional training examples by applying various transformations to existing ones. These preprocessing steps help improve the performance and efficiency of the deep learning model.
