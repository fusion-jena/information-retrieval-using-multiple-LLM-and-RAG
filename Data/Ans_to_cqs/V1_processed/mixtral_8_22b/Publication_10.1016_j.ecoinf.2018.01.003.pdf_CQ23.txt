To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, a diverse dataset was utilized, consisting of data from 1996 to 2015. This wide range of data helps prevent overfitting and ensures that the model can perform well on unseen data. Secondly, cross-validation was employed to optimize the parameters of the model. Specifically, 5-time cross-validation was used, which involves dividing the dataset into five subsets and training the model on four while testing it on the remaining one. This process is repeated until each subset has been used as the test set once. Cross-validation helps reduce bias and variance, leading to better performance on new data. Lastly, stratified splitting may also have been used, although it is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, considering best practices in machine learning, it is likely that the dataset was split into training and validation sets in such a way that the distribution of classes or labels remained consistent across both sets. Overall, these measures help ensure that the deep learning model can accurately predict ecological footprints even when presented with new data.
