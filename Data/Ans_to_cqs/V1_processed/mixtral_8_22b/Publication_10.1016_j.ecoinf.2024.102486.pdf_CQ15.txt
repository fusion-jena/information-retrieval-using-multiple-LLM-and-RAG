The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it does discuss various libraries and frameworks commonly used for deep learning tasks, including TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch. These libraries often include built-in support for popular optimization algorithms like SGD, Adam, and others. For instance, TensorFlow provides a wide range of optimizers, including SGD, Adam, and more advanced ones like AdaGrad, RMSProp, and Nadam. Similarly, Keras offers several optimizer classes, such as SGD, Adam, and RMSprop. PyTorch also supports multiple optimization methods, including SGD, Adam, and other variants. Therefore, while the context does not directly address the query, it implies that these libraries enable users to apply various optimization techniques in their deep learning pipelines.
