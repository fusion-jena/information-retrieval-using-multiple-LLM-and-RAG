The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training typically include a training set, a validation set, and a testing set. The training set is used to fit the parameters of the model, while the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. The testing set is used to evaluate the final performance of the model. The proportion of each dataset can vary depending on the specific application or problem being solved, but common splits include 60-20-20%, 70-15-15%, or 80-10-10%. It is important to ensure that the datasets are representative of the overall population and that they do not contain any biases or imbalances that could affect the accuracy of the model. Additionally, it is recommended to perform cross-validation to further improve the robustness and generalization ability of the model.
