Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no information about a specific code repository link for a deep learning pipeline related to this research. The context primarily discusses various studies and methods used for semantic segmentation, object detection, and classification tasks using deep learning techniques applied to satellite imagery data. However, it does not provide any direct links or references to a particular code repository containing the implementation details of these pipelines. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information with the available context.
