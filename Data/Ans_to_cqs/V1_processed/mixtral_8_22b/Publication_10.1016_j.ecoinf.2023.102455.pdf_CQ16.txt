The context does not provide explicit information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, based on common machine learning practices, some possible criteria could be:

1. Validation Loss Plateau: Training can be considered complete when the validation loss stops decreasing significantly with each epoch. This indicates that the model has learned all it can from the data and further training may lead to overfitting.

2. Maximum Number of Epochs: Training can also be stopped after a certain maximum number of epochs have been reached. This prevents unnecessary computation if the model has already converged.

3. Early Stopping: This technique involves monitoring the performance of the model on a separate validation set during training. If the performance on the validation set starts to degrade, even though the training loss continues to decrease, then training is halted. This helps prevent overfitting.

4. Learning Rate Schedule: Some models use a learning rate schedule, which reduces the learning rate as training progresses. When the learning rate reaches a minimum threshold, training can be considered complete.
