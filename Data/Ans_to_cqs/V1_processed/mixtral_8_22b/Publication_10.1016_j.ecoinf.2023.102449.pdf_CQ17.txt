In the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific regularization techniques like dropout or L2 regularization being employed to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss some strategies that can help improve generalization and prevent overfitting indirectly.

One such method mentioned is the use of batch normalization in the wide residual networks. Batch normalization helps in addressing internal covariate shift, which can lead to more stable training and improved convergence. It also allows for the use of higher learning rates, potentially leading to better optimization and reduced risk of overfitting.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of rectified linear units (ReLUs) as hidden layer activations. ReLUs have been shown to provide certain regularizing effects compared to other activation functions, helping to avoid saturation and improving gradient flow during backpropagation. This can contribute to better optimization and reduced likelihood of overfitting.

While these aspects do not directly correspond to traditional regularization techniques like dropout or L2 regularization, they still play important roles in preventing overfitting and promoting good generalization performance in the described deep learning pipeline.
