The context does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, based on general machine learning practices, some common criteria include observing a plateau in the validation loss, reaching a predefined number of epochs, or achieving a desired level of performance on a separate validation dataset. It's important to note that these criteria can vary depending on the specific problem, model architecture, and available resources.
