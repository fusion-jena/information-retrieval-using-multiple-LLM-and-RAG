The given text does not provide information about the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, etc. However, it discusses various machine learning algorithms like neural networks, CARTs, linear discriminant analysis, random forests, and support vector machines, and their application in supervised learning of animal behavior based on accelerometer (ACC) data. It also mentions that multiple machine learning algorithms and their ensembles might be needed for a specific behavioral category due to the potential inconsistent performance of certain algorithms across different behavioral categories.
