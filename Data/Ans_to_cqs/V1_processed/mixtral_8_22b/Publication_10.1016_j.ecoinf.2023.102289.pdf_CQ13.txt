Unfortunately, there is no information available regarding the specific hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model employed by LaDeco. However, it has been mentioned that LaDeco utilizes the deeplabv3+resnet269 model, which is a combination of DeepLab v3, a semantic segmentation algorithm developed by Google, and Resnet269, a 269-layer Resnet neural network. Additionally, users have the option to switch to other pre-trained models if necessary.
