In this study, the performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using classification accuracy. The authors divided the CLO-43SD dataset into five folds and performed 5-fold cross-validation. They reported the results as a box plot generated from the per-fold accuracies. To determine the best training epoch for the CNN model, they used one of the four training folds as a validation set and trained on the remaining three folds. Therefore, the primary metric used to assess the performance of the deep learning model in this study is classification accuracy.
