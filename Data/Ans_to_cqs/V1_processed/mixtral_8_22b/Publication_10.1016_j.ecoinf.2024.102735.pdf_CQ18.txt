The authors implemented a strategy to monitor the model performance during training by dividing all datasets randomly into two sets: 80% for training the Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) models, and 20% for testing the model. Furthermore, the training set was also randomly sampled to select training and validation sets to obtain optimized model hyperparameters. This approach allowed the researchers to evaluate the performance of their models during training and fine-tune them accordingly.
