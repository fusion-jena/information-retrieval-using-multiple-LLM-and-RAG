The text does not provide specific details regarding the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the model's performance was enhanced by introducing a hybrid model combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), which improved its ability to handle the complexity of drought propagation time and the relationship between influencing factors. Notably, the integration of LSTM into the CNN led to a significant improvement in the model's prediction accuracy on the testing set, even without adjusting the hyperparameters. While the learning rate is mentioned as one example of a hyperparameter, no further information is given about other hyperparameters or their values.
