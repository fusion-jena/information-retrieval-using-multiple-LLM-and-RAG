Based on the given information, there isn't any explicit mention of the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, typically in machine learning tasks like this, some commonly used criteria include reaching a certain number of epochs, achieving a desired level of accuracy or precision, or observing a plateau in the validation loss. The choice of criterion often depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the task at hand. It would be best to refer to the original source or consult with domain experts for more precise information.
