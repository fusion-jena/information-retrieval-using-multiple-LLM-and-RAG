Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about the specific method or source used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the input data includes a tree and a pole, which could suggest the use of remote sensing techniques such as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) or photogrammetry. These technologies often employ sensors mounted on aircraft or drones to gather detailed spatial data, including trees and poles. Additionally, references to works like Guan et al.'s "Deep learning-based tree classification using mobile LiDAR data" and Hackel et al.'s "Semantic3d.net: A new large-scale point cloud classification benchmark" indicate potential usage of LiDAR data. Nonetheless, without more precise details regarding the data collection method, one cannot definitively state whether surveys, sensors, or public datasets were employed.
