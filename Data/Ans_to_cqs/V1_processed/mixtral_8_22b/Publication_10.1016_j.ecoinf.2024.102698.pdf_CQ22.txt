The text does not provide explicit information about the specific evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the deep learning model. However, it mentions that convolutional neural networks (CNN), autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks (GAN) were employed for learning patterns in the data. These types of models are typically evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC), among others. In particular, the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) mentioned in the text consists of two components - a generator and a discriminator. The generator aims to produce realistic samples, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and fake samples. Therefore, common evaluation metrics for GANs include Frechet Inception Distance (FID), Inception Score (IS), and Mean Squared Error (MSE), among others. However, since the text does not explicitly mention any specific evaluation metrics, we cannot definitively state which ones were used in this case.
