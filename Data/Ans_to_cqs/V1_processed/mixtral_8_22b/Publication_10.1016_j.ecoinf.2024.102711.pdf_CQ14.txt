The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using grid search. Grid search is employed to evaluate the data-driven model's performance using each combination of predefined hyperparameters and identify the best hyperparameters. The maximum depth of the tree, the number of trees in the ensemble model, and the learning rate are tuned in this study as the influential hyperparameters.
