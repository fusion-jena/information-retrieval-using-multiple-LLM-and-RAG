The given context does not provide specific information about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses segmentation and classification strategies in eCognition, which is a software tool used for image analysis and object-based image processing. The text mentions that segmentation and classification strategies are rapidly evolving, and methods for automatically selecting segmentation parameters are under development. It also notes that machine learning techniques are being combined with segmentation to more automatically classify images.

Regarding data bias, the text suggests that better classifications may be possible as these tools develop further, implying that improved accuracy in image classification could help reduce data bias. Additionally, the text emphasizes the importance of supervision and validation using aerial photo interpretation techniques or other data sources when applying machine learning techniques. This indicates that incorporating diverse data sources and manual verification processes can help mitigate potential biases introduced by automated algorithms.

While the context does not explicitly mention stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, these techniques are commonly employed to address data bias in deep learning pipelines. Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing subsets while maintaining the original distribution of classes within each subset. Oversampling increases the representation of minority classes in the dataset, while undersampling reduces the representation of majority classes. Diverse data collection aims to gather a wide range of examples from different sources to ensure that the model generalizes well across various scenarios. These techniques can be applied during the preprocessing stage of the deep learning pipeline to minimize data bias and improve overall performance.
