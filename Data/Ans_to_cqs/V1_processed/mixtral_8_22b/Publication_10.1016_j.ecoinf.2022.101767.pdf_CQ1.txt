In the given context, there is no direct mention of specific methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer some possible methods based on the information available.

One potential method could involve using publicly available datasets, such as the statistics of Japan mentioned in one of the sources. This dataset might provide valuable demographic or environmental data relevant to the project.

Additionally, another source discusses extracting data from online shared videos containing various wild bird species. In this case, the researchers may use web scraping techniques to collect these videos automatically. Web scraping involves writing code to programmatically access websites and extract structured data from them.

Furthermore, other studies cited in the context suggest using questionnaires, surveys, or interviews to gather data about ecosystem services. While not explicitly stated, it is plausible that similar methods could also be employed to collect raw data for a deep learning pipeline.

Lastly, although not directly related to the deep learning pipeline, one source mentions utilizing national geographic distribution and the number of TV nature programs across the Japanese archipelago. This implies that data collection could potentially involve analyzing media content or broadcast schedules.

Overall, while the exact methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline remain unclear, possibilities include using publicly available datasets, web scraping, traditional survey methods, and analyzing media content.
