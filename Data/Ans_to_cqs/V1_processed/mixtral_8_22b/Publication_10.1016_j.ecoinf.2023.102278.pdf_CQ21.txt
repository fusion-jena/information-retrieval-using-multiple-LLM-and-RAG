After the model training, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the project or study. Some common postprocessing steps include:

1. Model Evaluation: After training, it is essential to evaluate the performance of the model using various metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, etc. These metrics provide insights into how well the model performs on unseen data.

2. Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the predictions made by the model compared to the actual labels. It provides a visual representation of the model's performance and helps identify any biases or errors in the prediction.

3. Saliency Maps: Saliency maps highlight the regions of an image that contribute significantly to the final output of the model. They help understand the decision-making process of the model and improve its interpretability.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning: Postprocessing may also involve tuning hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, regularization parameters, etc., to optimize the model's performance further.

5. Ensemble Methods: Combining multiple models to create an ensemble can improve the overall performance of the system. Techniques such as bagging, boosting, stacking, etc., can be employed to build ensembles.

Based on the given context, it appears that the authors have calculated average precision, recall, and F1-scores for their trained models. However, there is no explicit mention of other postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, confusion matrices, or hyperparameter tuning. Therefore, it cannot be determined if these methods were applied in this particular case.
