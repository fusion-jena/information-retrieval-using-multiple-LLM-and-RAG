Based on the given information, it appears that the study uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a Stacked Autoencoder (SAE) classifier for its analysis. However, there is no explicit mention of a specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training.

For the SVM, the paper mentions a parameter setting method using a sensitivity analysis approach, where different combinations of parameters are tested to achieve the highest overall accuracy. This could be considered as a form of monitoring the model performance during training, but it does not provide details about how the performance was monitored or evaluated throughout the training process.

As for the SAE, the paper discusses the use of mean error and the number of misclassified points to determine the optimal number of iterations (see Fig. 6). Again, while this can be seen as a way to evaluate the model performance during training, it does not offer insights into any continuous monitoring strategies employed during the training phase.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it cannot be definitively stated what specific strategy was implemented to monitor the model performance during training.
