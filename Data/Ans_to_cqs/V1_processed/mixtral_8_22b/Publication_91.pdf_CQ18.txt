The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using a batch size of 32 and an initial learning rate of 0.001. This learning rate is then exponentially decayed every 3 epochs with a factor of 0.94. The model's performance is evaluated based on its classification rate or accuracy for each species, which is calculated using the formula: TP + TN / (TP + TN + FP + FN). Here, TP refers to true positives, TN to true negatives, FP to false positives, and FN to false negatives. Additionally, the model's performance is assessed using per-channel accuracy and F-measure, where higher values indicate better performance.
