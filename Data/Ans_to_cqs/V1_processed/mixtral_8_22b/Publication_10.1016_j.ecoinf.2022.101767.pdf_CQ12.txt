The text does not provide explicit information about the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it mentions that a machine learning algorithm was employed to select important video factors related to the number of views. Unfortunately, without more specific details, it cannot be determined whether the algorithm utilized a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Transformer, or another type of deep learning model.
