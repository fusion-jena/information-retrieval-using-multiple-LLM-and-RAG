The information provided does not explicitly state the specific file format used for storing or processing the datasets. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the datasets used in this study are images. This is evident from the mention of color and grayscale datasets, as well as references to deep convolutional neural networks, which are commonly used for image classification tasks. Therefore, the data formats used in this deep learning pipeline would likely include common image file formats such as JPEG, PNG, or TIFF.
