The paper does not explicitly mention the use of any specific deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers in their pipeline. Instead, they focus on traditional machine learning algorithms like Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Therefore, it can be concluded that no particular deep learning model was employed in this study.
