Based on the given context, there isn't enough information to determine the specific purpose of the deep learning model mentioned. However, generally speaking, deep learning models can be used for various tasks such as image or speech recognition, natural language processing, and even decision making processes. They can perform tasks like classification, where they categorize input into different classes, segmentation, which involves partitioning an image into multiple segments or regions, and object detection, where they identify and locate objects within an image. Without more specific details about the deep learning model in question, we cannot provide a definitive answer regarding its purpose.
