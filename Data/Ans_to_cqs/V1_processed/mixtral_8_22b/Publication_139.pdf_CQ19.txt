The deep learning model used in this study is built using the Python package Keras with a Tensorflow backend. This information can be found in section 2.5 of the given context, titled "Convolutional Neural Network Architecture." Specifically, it states, "To classify the spectrograms, a two-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) was constructed using the Python package Keras with a Tensorflow backend." Therefore, the frameworks used to build the deep learning model are Keras and Tensorflow.
