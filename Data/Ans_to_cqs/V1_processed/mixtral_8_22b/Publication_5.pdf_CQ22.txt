The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several statistical accuracy metrics. These include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Bias, and Correlation.

The MAE measures the average magnitude of errors in a set of predictions without considering their direction. It’s the average over the test sample of the absolute differences between prediction and actual observation where all individual differences have equal weight.

The RMSE is a measure of the differences between predicted and observed values. It’s calculated as the square root of the mean of the squared differences between prediction and actual observation. This gives more weight to large errors, making it sensitive to outliers.

Bias refers to the difference between the expected value and the estimated value. A positive bias indicates that the estimator tends to overestimate the parameter, while a negative bias indicates that the estimator tends to underestimate the parameter.

Correlation measures the strength and direction of association between two or more variables. In this case, it likely refers to how well the predicted values correlate with the actual observations.

These metrics help assess the quality of the model's predictions and provide insights into potential biases or issues with the model. However, they do not directly correspond to traditional classification metrics like accuracy, precision, or recall, as these are typically used when dealing with categorical rather than continuous outputs.
