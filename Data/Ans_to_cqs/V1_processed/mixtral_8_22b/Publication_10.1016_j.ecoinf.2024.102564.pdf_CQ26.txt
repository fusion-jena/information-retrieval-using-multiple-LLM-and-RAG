While the given context does not directly discuss techniques to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, it is still possible to provide some general information on this topic. Data bias can be addressed through various techniques such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified sampling involves dividing the dataset into different subsets based on specific criteria, such as class labels, and then randomly selecting samples from these subsets to create a more balanced dataset. This technique helps ensure that all classes are represented equally in the final dataset.

Oversampling is another approach to addressing data bias where additional copies of minority class examples are created to balance out the majority class. Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is one popular algorithm used for oversampling. It creates synthetic samples by interpolating between existing minority class instances.

Undersampling, on the other hand, involves removing samples from the majority class until both classes have equal representation. However, this technique may result in loss of valuable information since it discards potentially useful data points.

Finally, collecting diverse data is crucial to reducing data bias. By gathering data from multiple sources and ensuring diversity within the dataset, we can minimize any potential biases introduced due to limited sample sizes or skewed distributions.

In conclusion, there are several techniques available to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. These include stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages, so choosing the appropriate technique depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the problem at hand.
