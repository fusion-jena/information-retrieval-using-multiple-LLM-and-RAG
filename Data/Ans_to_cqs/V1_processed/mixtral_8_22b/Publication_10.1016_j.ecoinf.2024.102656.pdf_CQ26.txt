Based on the given context, it appears there is no direct mention of specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, some relevant information can still be extracted regarding how the authors handled potential biases in their dataset.

In the context provided, the authors mentioned employing a 3:1 train-test split for the occurrence points to facilitate model training. While not explicitly stated, this approach could potentially help reduce any sampling bias present in the dataset. Additionally, they generated 1000 random pseudo-absence points (five times the number of occurrence points per species) across the study area. These pseudo-absence points serve as a reference for areas unlikely to be inhabited by the target species, which might aid in addressing any spatial bias in the dataset.

Moreover, the authors utilized an ensemble modeling framework that combines forecasts from multiple statistical models. This approach helps enhance predictive accuracy and mitigate uncertainties and biases inherent in relying on a single modeling method. The five statistical models used in this ensemble framework include Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Maximum Entropy (Max-Ent), Random Forest (RF), Generalized Boosting Model (GBM), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS). By integrating these different models, the authors aimed to improve overall model performance and minimize potential biases associated with each individual model.

Lastly, evaluation and comparative analyses were conducted for both individual models and the ensemble model using Area Under Curve (AUC) and True Skill Statistic (TSS) metrics. This comprehensive assessment allows for a better understanding of model performance and assists in making more reliable predictions about species distribution across the central Iranian plateau.

While the context does not directly discuss techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, it highlights several strategies employed by the authors to handle potential biases in their dataset.
