The information regarding the availability of the deep learning pipeline's data repository is not explicitly mentioned within the given context. However, based on common practices in scientific research, one can assume that the authors might have shared their dataset or code in a public repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. To find out where exactly the data repository is located, I recommend checking the original paper or contacting the corresponding author directly.

Based on the context provided, it appears that the study uses a pre-trained ResNet-50 CNN model for extracting features from images. This suggests that the researchers may have used publicly available datasets, such as ImageNet, for training their model. Nevertheless, without further details about the specific implementation of the deep learning pipeline, it remains unclear whether the authors have also released any custom datasets or code related to their work.
