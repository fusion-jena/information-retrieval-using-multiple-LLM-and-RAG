The text does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it mentions that the authors used TensorFlow, a popular open-source library for machine learning, including deep learning applications. TensorFlow allows users to set random seeds for reproducibility purposes, ensuring consistent results across different runs or environments. By setting a specific random seed, researchers can control the random processes involved in their models, like weight initialization and shuffling datasets. This practice is essential for debugging, comparing results, and maintaining consistency in research projects.

In summary, while the given context doesn't directly address how the authors handled randomness in their deep learning pipeline, it implies they might have utilized TensorFlow's functionality to manage random seeds for achieving reproducible results.
