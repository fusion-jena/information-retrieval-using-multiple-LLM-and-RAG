Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the datasets are divided into training and testing sets according to an 8:2 ratio, resulting in 3094 test samples and 12,340 training samples. It also discusses using classic CNN models and proposed models for building classification models, but no explicit mention of any standard dataset like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet is made. Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot determine the exact datasets used in this deep learning pipeline.
