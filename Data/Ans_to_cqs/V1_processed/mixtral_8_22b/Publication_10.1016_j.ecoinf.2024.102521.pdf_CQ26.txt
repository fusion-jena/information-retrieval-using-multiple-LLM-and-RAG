The provided context does not explicitly mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the context that there is a need for more entomological field data to better understand various aspects related to insects, including impacts of agricultural management practices, biodiversity, invasions, and effects of climate change. Additionally, the scarcity of entomological big data resources has led to controversies regarding its interpretation.

To address these issues, one approach could involve collecting diverse data sets to reduce potential biases and improve generalizability. This might include stratified sampling methods to ensure representation across different categories or conditions. Oversampling or undersampling techniques may also be employed to balance classes within the dataset if certain types of observations are underrepresented or overrepresented. These strategies aim to mitigate any inherent biases present in the original data sources and promote fairness and accuracy in model predictions.

Moreover, collaborative efforts between researchers, institutions, and funding agencies can help facilitate data sharing and standardization, which would contribute to building larger and more comprehensive databases. Encouraging open access policies and requiring data sharing as part of publication requirements could further support this goal. Ultimately, addressing data bias during preprocessing requires careful consideration of both technical approaches and broader ethical concerns surrounding responsible use of artificial intelligence technologies.
