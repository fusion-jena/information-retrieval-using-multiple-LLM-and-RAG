The given references do not provide explicit information about the use of specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet in the deep learning pipelines mentioned in those papers. However, some general insights regarding dataset usage can still be derived from these sources.

In the paper by Abu and Diamant (2022), they propose a feature analysis method to distinguish underwater man-made objects (MMOs) from natural environments using contour-based features. Although it does not explicitly mention any standard datasets like MNIST or CIFAR, it implies that the authors have utilized custom datasets containing underwater imagery and sonographic data.

Similarly, Han et al. (2022) present a deep learning model called LCSE-ResNet for detecting, classifying, and locating marine targets such as vessels and oil platforms using remote optical imagery. This suggests that the researchers employed a custom dataset consisting of satellite or drone-acquired images of marine environments.

Lastly, Kuru et al.'s works (2014, 2018, 2019) discuss various aspects of machine learning and computer vision applications but do not directly address the topic of specific datasets used in deep learning pipelines.

To summarize, while none of the referenced papers specifically state the use of popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, they imply the utilization of custom datasets tailored to their respective research objectives.
