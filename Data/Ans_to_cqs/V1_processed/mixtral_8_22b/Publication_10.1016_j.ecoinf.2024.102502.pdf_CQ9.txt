The text does not provide explicit information about where the data repository for the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it mentions that users can retrieve the EOS data catalogue from the GEE online repository (<https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/>). Therefore, it can be inferred that the data repository might be available on the Google Earth Engine platform. Nevertheless, without more specific details, it cannot be confirmed if the data repository is also available on other platforms like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
