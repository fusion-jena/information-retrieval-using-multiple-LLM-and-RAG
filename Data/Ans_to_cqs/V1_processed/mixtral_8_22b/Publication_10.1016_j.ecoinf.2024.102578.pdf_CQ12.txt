In this study, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) called ResNet-50 is employed for the deep learning model. This architecture is specifically designed for image recognition tasks and has been proven effective due to its depth of 50 layers. It allows for more complex features to be learned during the training process, which can improve overall performance.
