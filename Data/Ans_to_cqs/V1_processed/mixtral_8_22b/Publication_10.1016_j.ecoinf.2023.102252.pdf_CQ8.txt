The information provided does not mention any specific details about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline might be located. It only provides general information about the development of a computationally efficient floodplain ecological response model for large-scale, data-sparse riparian environments. Therefore, it is not possible to determine from this information alone where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
