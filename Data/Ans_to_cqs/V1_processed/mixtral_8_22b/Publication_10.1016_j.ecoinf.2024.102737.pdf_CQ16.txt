The context does not provide information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, common criteria include reaching a certain number of epochs, achieving a desired level of accuracy or loss on the validation set, or observing a plateau in the validation loss. These criteria depend on the specific problem and model being trained.

Based on the given context, it appears that the authors conducted initial experiments to evaluate various aspects such as architecture, data augmentation usage, feature extraction enhancement, and handling different poses. They evaluated the results of these initial experiments to guide their design of follow-up experiments. However, the context does not explicitly mention any criteria used to determine when training was complete during these experiments. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer based solely on the given context.
