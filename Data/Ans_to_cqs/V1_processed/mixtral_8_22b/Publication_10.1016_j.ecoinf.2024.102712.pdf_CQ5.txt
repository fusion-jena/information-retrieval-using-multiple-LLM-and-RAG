The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific dataset used in a deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it mentions the use of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery data, which could potentially be used as part of a deep learning pipeline for tasks like land cover classification or object detection. Additionally, the context refers to the use of the Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin for QGIS, which may involve processing remote sensing images for machine learning applications. The paper by Daryaei et al. (2020) discusses fine-scale vegetation detection using Sentinel-2 and UAV data, suggesting that these datasets might have been employed in their study. Nonetheless, without further details about the specific deep learning pipelines mentioned in the context, we cannot definitively state which datasets were utilized.
