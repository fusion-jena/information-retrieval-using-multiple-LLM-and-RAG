Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer based solely on the information given. However, some common strategies used to manage randomness in deep learning pipelines include setting specific seed values for reproducibility, employing techniques like cross-validation or bootstrapping to account for variability, and using ensemble methods to combine multiple models trained with different seeds or initializations.
