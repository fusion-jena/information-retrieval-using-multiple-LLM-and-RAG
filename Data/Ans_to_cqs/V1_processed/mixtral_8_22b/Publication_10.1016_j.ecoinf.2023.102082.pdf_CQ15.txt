The given context does not provide specific details about the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) were used. However, since the research involves training a deep convolutional neural network, it is likely that some form of gradient descent optimization technique was employed during the training process. Without further information, we cannot confirm the exact optimization technique used.
