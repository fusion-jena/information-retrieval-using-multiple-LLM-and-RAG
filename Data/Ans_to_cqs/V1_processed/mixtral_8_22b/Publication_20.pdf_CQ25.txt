The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, based on the information provided, we can infer that the model is designed for fish identification and classification. The model uses a GoogleNet architecture, which is known for its high accuracy in image recognition tasks. Additionally, the model is tested on a dataset of fish thumbnails belonging to different species, further suggesting that the primary goal of the model is to identify and classify fish species accurately.
