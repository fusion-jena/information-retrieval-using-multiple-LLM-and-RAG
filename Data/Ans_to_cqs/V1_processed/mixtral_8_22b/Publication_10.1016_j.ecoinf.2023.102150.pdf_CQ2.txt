Based on the given information, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily uses image data. This is evident from several mentions of images throughout the text, such as references to camera trap images, true positives, false positives, and false negatives, which are common terms used in image analysis. Additionally, there are no explicit mentions of other data formats like audio, video, or CSV files. Therefore, it can be concluded that the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is image data.
