The text does not provide specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that various sets of hyperparameters were tried using YOLOv6, but only marginal improvements were observed. Therefore, the default settings were used. Unfortunately, the exact values or types of hyperparameters are not disclosed in the given context.
