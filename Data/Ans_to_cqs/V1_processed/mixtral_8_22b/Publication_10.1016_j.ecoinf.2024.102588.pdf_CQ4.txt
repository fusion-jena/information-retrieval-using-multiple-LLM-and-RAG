The given context does not provide specific details about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotation, or scaling. However, it mentions that only one previous study applied a CNN-based approach to augment aquatic ecosystem health data (Lee et al., 2021). Data augmentation techniques are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to increase the amount of available training data and improve the generalization capabilities of models. These techniques include geometric transformations like flipping, rotating, and scaling, as well as color space transformations and random erasing. While the context does not explicitly mention these techniques, they are often employed when working with image data, especially in conjunction with CNNs.
