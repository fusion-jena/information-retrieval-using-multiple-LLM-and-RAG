The data repository of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, it does mention that platforms like eBird, Pl@ntNet, iNaturalist, and Observation.org are available on the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). Therefore, one could infer that these platforms might be used as part of a deep learning pipeline, but this is speculative without further information. It would be best to refer directly to the source material for accurate details about the specific data repositories used in the deep learning pipeline.
