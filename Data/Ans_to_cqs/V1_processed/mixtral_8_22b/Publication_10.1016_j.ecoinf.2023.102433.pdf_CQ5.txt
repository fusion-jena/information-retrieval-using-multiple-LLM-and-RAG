The provided context does not mention any specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it discusses the nasawebservice, a Python package designed for the automatic MODIS data ingestion from the NASA MODIS/VIIRS Land Products Web Service. The package facilitates the creation of data processing workflows and is intended to be compatible with various user needs. It uses the Global Subset APIs of the NASA service and provides additional methods to make the data ingestion pipeline scalable. The obtained data are in JSON format, which helps avoid pre-processing operations that might hinder the use of satellite imagery. However, there is no information about the usage of any particular dataset in a deep learning pipeline within the provided context.
