Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, typically, the dataset is randomly divided into these subsets. For instance, one common approach is to use 70% of the data for training, 20% for testing, and 10% for validation. This division allows the model to learn patterns from the majority of the data during training while also providing separate datasets for evaluating its performance and tuning parameters. It should be noted that the optimal ratio may vary depending on factors such as the size of the dataset or the complexity of the problem being addressed. Therefore, without additional information, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the exact criteria used in this particular case.
