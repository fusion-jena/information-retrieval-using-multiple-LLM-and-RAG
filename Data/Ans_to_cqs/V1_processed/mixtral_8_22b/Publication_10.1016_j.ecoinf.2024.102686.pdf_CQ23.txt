The text does not provide specific information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it mentions that machine learning, including deep learning, combines flexibility with the ability to systematically generalize. This suggests that some form of generalization techniques might have been used, but without explicit details, we cannot confirm if diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting were employed.
