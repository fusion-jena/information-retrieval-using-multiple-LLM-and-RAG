After the model training step, there are several postprocessing steps involved in this workflow. These include manual quality checks, final data formatting, and a second round of classification. Manual quality checks involve inspecting the output of the initial classification step to ensure accuracy and reliability. Final data formatting involves preparing the data for further analysis or presentation. The second round of classification involves using the trained model to classify additional images, which can help improve the overall accuracy of the model. Other potential postprocessing steps not explicitly mentioned in this workflow may include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score, and creating confusion matrices to evaluate the performance of the model. However, these steps would depend on the specific requirements and goals of the project.
