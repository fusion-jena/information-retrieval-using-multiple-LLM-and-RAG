Unfortunately, there isn't any information regarding specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline in the provided context. However, some common techniques used to handle data imbalance include stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and collecting diverse datasets.

Stratified sampling ensures that the distribution of classes in the training set remains similar to the original dataset. Oversampling increases the representation of minority classes by duplicating samples from those classes, while undersampling reduces the majority class size by randomly removing samples. Collecting diverse datasets can also help mitigate biases by ensuring that the model is trained on a more representative sample of real-world scenarios.
