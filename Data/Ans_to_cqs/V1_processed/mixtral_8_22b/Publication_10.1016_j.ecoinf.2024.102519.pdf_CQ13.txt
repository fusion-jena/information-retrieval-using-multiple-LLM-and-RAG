Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning models mentioned. However, it can be noted that genetic optimization algorithms were used to adjust the hyperparameters to determine the algorithm parameters for this study. This suggests that the authors likely experimented with different values for common hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and choice of optimizer. These hyperparameters play a crucial role in determining the performance of a deep learning model, and their optimal values often depend on the specific problem being addressed. Therefore, without further details, it cannot be definitively stated what exact hyperparameters were used in the deep learning models discussed in the given context.
