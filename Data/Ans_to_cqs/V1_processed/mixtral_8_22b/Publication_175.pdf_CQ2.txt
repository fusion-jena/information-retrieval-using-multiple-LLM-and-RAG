The provided context primarily discusses the application of deep learning in image classification tasks, specifically using ResNet 100 (He et al., 2016) as the chosen deep learning algorithm. This indicates that the primary data format used in this particular deep learning pipeline is images. However, it should be noted that other types of data can also be utilized in deep learning pipelines depending on the specific application or problem being addressed. For instance, the paper titled "Neural Networks Audio-based Bird Species Identification With Deep Convolutional Neural Networks" suggests that audio files could be another type of data format employed in a different deep learning pipeline. Other common data formats used in deep learning include videos, text, and structured data such as CSV files. Ultimately, the choice of data format depends on the nature of the problem and the desired outcome of the deep learning model.
