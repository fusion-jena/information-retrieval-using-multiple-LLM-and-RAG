The given context does not provide information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which data augmentation techniques were used, such as flipping, rotating, scaling, etc.

Unhelpful 
The paper uses a neural network (NN) for tasks like classification and regression. However, there is no mention of any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
