The given context does not provide explicit information about specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model. However, some general preprocessing techniques can be assumed based on common practices in machine learning and deep learning. These may include data cleaning, such as handling missing values or outliers, and data transformation, like normalization or scaling. Normalization typically involves rescaling features so they fall within a certain range, while scaling adjusts the magnitude of features without changing their distribution. Additionally, the text mentions batch normalization being performed using an adaptive normalization operator, which suggests that input data might have been normalized during the training process. Nonetheless, without more detailed information, it cannot be confirmed if these specific preprocessing steps were applied in this case.
