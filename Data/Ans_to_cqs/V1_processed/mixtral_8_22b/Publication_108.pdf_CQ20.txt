The deep learning model was trained using eight high-end General Purpose Graphic Processing Units (GPGPUs) from NVIDIA, specifically Tesla P100 models. Each GPU has 16GB of RAM. These GPUs were utilized during the training process, which employed backpropagation to update the weights of the neural network using the Adam Optimizer. The training continued until overfitting began to occur, indicating that the neural network started failing to generalize.
