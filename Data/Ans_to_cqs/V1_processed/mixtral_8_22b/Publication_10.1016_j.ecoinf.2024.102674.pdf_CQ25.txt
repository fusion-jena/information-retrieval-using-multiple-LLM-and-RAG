The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, based on the information available, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is used for downscaling near-surface wind fields to high-resolution topography in highly complex terrain. This is suggested by the title of the paper "Wind-topo: downscaling near-surface wind fields to high-resolution topography in highly complex terrain with deep learning" by Dujardin and Lehning (2022). Therefore, the deep learning model appears to be designed for improving the accuracy and detail of wind field predictions in challenging terrains.
