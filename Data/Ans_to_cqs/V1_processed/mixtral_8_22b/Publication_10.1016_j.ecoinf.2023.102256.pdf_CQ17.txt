In the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, some techniques can be inferred from the text that could potentially help mitigate overfitting.

One technique mentioned is the use of a multi-branch CNN, which might imply the application of ensemble methods to improve generalization and reduce overfitting. Ensemble methods combine multiple models to produce better predictions than any single model alone. By training different branches of the CNN independently, it may lead to diverse feature extraction and decision boundaries, thus reducing overfitting.

Additionally, the context mentions using a limited number of data points for over-represented categories, which suggests employing a form of data balancing or undersampling. Balancing the dataset helps prevent the model from being biased towards the majority classes, improving its overall performance and reducing overfitting.

Lastly, the authors employed the Adam optimizer with a relatively small learning rate (0.0005) and trained the model for a fixed number of epochs (10) with a moderate batch size (32). These hyperparameter choices can contribute to preventing overfitting. A smaller learning rate allows the model to converge more slowly, making it less likely to get stuck in local minima or overfit the training data. Similarly, limiting the number of epochs prevents the model from memorizing the training set, and using a moderate batch size enables the optimization algorithm to find a good balance between bias and variance.
