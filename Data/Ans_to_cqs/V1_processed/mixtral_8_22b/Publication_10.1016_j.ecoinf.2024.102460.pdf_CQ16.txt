The table provided does not contain information on the criteria used to determine when training is complete or any specific details about a machine learning model. However, some common criteria used to determine when training is complete include:

* Validation Loss Plateau: When the validation loss stops decreasing significantly after each epoch, it may indicate that the model has learned all it can from the training data and further training will not improve its performance.
* Early Stopping: This technique involves stopping the training process before the model starts overfitting the training data. It requires setting aside a portion of the training data as a validation set and tracking the validation error during training. Training is stopped when the validation error begins to increase.
* Maximum Number of Epochs: Another simple criterion is to stop training after a certain number of epochs have passed. This approach assumes that the model will eventually converge if given enough time.
* Learning Rate Schedule: Some models adjust their learning rates during training based on a predefined schedule. For example, the learning rate might decrease every few epochs until it reaches a minimum value. Once the learning rate hits this minimum value, training could be considered complete.
