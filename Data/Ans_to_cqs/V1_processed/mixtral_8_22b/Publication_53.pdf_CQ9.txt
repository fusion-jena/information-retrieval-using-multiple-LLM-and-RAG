The text does not provide explicit information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that the authors used Python and fastai for developing the deep learning CNN and R for statistical analyses. They also mentioned that they downloaded satellite images from three different repositories (http://ecn.t3.tiles.virtualearth.net, <https://api.mapbox.com>, and <https://server.arcgisonline.com>). However, it does not specify whether the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is publicly accessible or if it has been uploaded to any specific platform such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
