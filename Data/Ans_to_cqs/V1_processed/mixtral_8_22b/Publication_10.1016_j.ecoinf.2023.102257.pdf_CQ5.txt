The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it discusses various machine learning methods applied to determine if an animal is present in an image, which includes measurement of differences between consecutive images, convolutional neural networks, and ensemble learning. Additionally, object detection models like RetinaNet and Faster R-CNN were mentioned for ungulate detection and species classification from camera trap images. Therefore, while no explicit dataset names are given, we can infer that the authors likely utilized custom datasets consisting of camera trap images for their research purposes.
