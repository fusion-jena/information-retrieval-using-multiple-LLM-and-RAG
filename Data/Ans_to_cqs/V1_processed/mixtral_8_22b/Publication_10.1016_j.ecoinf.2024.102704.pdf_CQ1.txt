The context does not provide explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions a targeted fish species dataset, suggesting that this dataset might have been collected using various methods such as surveys or sensors. Additionally, there are references to studies that use underwater devices for fish size monitoring (Coro & Walsh, 2021) and high-resolution monitoring of fish length and catch numbers (Palmer, 2022). These studies imply the usage of specialized equipment like cameras or sensors for gathering data. Furthermore, the study by Durve et al. (2022) discusses automatic droplet tracking with YOLOv5 and DeepSORT for microfluidic applications, indicating the potential use of advanced imaging techniques for data collection. Lastly, the reference to a paper discussing fish detection based on multi-enhancement and output fusion of fuzzy underwater images (Qin et al., 2022) suggests the utilization of image processing techniques for acquiring relevant data.
