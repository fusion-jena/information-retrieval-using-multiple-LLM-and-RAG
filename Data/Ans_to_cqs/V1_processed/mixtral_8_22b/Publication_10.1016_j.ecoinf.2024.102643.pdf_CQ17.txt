In the field of machine learning, including deep learning pipelines, overfitting is a common problem where a model learns the training data too well and performs poorly on unseen data. To address this issue, several regularization techniques have been developed. Two commonly used regularization methods in deep learning are Dropout and L2 Regularization.

Dropout is a technique introduced by Srivastava et al. (2014) that randomly drops out neurons during training with a certain probability. This helps prevent complex co-adaptations among neurons, reducing overfitting. During testing, all neurons are active but their outputs are scaled down by the same factor as the dropout rate used during training.

L2 Regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. By adding this penalty, it encourages smaller weights, which can help reduce overfitting. In practice, L2 Regularization is often implemented using Ridge Regression, which minimizes the sum of squared residuals plus a penalty term for large coefficients.

Other regularization methods include L1 Regularization, Early Stopping, and Data Augmentation. L1 Regularization, also known as Lasso Regression, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the absolute value of the weights. Early Stopping stops training when validation error starts increasing, preventing further overfitting. Data Augmentation generates additional training examples by applying transformations such as rotation, scaling, and flipping to existing images, helping improve generalization.
