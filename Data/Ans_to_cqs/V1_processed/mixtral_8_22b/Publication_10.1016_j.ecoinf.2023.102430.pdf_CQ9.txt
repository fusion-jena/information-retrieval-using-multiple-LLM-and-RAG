The text does not provide information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that the AN model was implemented in MATLAB and the 'classical' machine-learning algorithms were run in Python using the scikit-learn toolbox. However, it does not specify any details regarding the availability of the data repository. Therefore, I do not have the necessary information to answer this query accurately.
