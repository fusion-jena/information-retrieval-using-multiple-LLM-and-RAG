The purpose of the deep learning model described here is image classification. This can be determined from the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are commonly used for image recognition tasks, including image classification. Additionally, the mention of impressive results obtained in the ImageNet challenge further supports this conclusion, as ImageNet is a large dataset specifically designed for image classification tasks. Furthermore, the description of stacking multiple convolutional layers, which look for different visual patterns, also aligns with the goal of identifying and categorizing objects within images.
