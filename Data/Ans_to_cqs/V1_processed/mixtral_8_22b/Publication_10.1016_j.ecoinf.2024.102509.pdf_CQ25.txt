The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, considering the information available, we can infer that the Back Propagation Artificial Neural Network (BP-ANN) model is being developed for regression analysis. This type of model is typically employed when dealing with complex datasets and aims to minimize the gap between anticipated outputs and actual target values.

The BP-ANN model consists of an input layer with 'n' covariates, two hidden layers containing 'p' hidden neurons each, and an output layer with one output neuron. The primary goal of this model is to modify the weights and biases of the network's neurons to reduce the discrepancy between predicted and actual outcomes.

Although the specific application or task for which this BP-ANN model is intended is not mentioned, it can be assumed that the model will be utilized for predictive purposes due to its use in regression analysis. Deep learning models like these are commonly employed for tasks such as forecasting, pattern recognition, and decision making within various domains, including agriculture, ecology, and environmental sciences.
