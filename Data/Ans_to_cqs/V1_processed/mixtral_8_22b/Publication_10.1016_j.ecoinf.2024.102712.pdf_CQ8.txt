The given context does not provide any direct reference or link to a specific code repository containing a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is impossible to determine where the code repository of such a pipeline might be located based solely on this information. The sources mentioned primarily discuss various aspects related to remote sensing, satellite imagery analysis, and above-ground biomass estimation but do not explicitly mention a particular deep learning pipeline or its associated code repository.
