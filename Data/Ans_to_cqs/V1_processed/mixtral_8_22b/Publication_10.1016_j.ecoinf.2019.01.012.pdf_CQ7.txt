The data was split into three sets: training, validation, and test. The validation set was used during training for fine-tuning hyperparameters and model selection. After finding the best model setup, its prediction error was assessed on the test set. The whole set of samples was first divided into three parts: 10% for the validation set, another 10% for the test set, and the remaining 80% for the training set. To increase the number of sample tiles, data augmentation was applied to the training set. Data augmentation involves applying slight transformations to the original data to create new training samples artificially.
