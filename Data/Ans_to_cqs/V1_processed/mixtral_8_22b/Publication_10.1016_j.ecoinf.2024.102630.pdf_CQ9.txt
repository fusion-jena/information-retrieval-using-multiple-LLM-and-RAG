The context does not provide specific information about where the data repository for the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it mentions that the data used in this study was sourced from the Google Earth Engine platform and the Resource and Environmental Data Center of Western China. It also lists several datasets such as the 16-day synthesized MOD13Q1 V6 NDVI dataset, the daily NOAA Climate Data Record (CDR) of AVHRR NDVI V5 dataset, and the third generation GIMMS NDVI from AVHRR sensors dataset. Unfortunately, without more specific details, I cannot determine the exact location or name of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline.
