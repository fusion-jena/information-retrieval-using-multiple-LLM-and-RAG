The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, confusion matrix, etc. However, it does discuss some aspects related to the methodology and ablation studies.

The methodology section mentions the use of deep noise reduction techniques and the generation of training data for fine-tuning by collecting clean data and superimposing noise profiles. It also highlights the challenges faced when collecting clean recordings, which might be infeasible or unrepresentative of the wider population.

The ablation studies section emphasizes the importance of considering data requirements for various monitoring applications due to the lack of existing datasets. It suggests that audio enhancement models need training data for fine-tuning, although large datasets are not necessarily required. Data augmentation techniques like superimposing noise samples should also be taken into account, especially for bioacoustic applications with abundant noise features. Additionally, wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) and spectral subtraction methods do not require training data.

However, none of these sections directly address the postprocessing steps mentioned in the query. Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot accurately determine what specific postprocessing steps are involved after the model training.
