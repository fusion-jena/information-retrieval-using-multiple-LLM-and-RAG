After the model training process, there are several postprocessing steps involved in LaDeco. These include:

1. Analysis Module: This module conducts the core analytical tasks. After receiving the images from the user, it sends them to the Semantic Segmentation (SS) model. The SS model produces a pixel count for 150 objects.

2. Data Filtering Module: This module filters irrelevant data. In this step, any data that falls below a certain threshold are assigned a value of zero. Users can set this threshold to filter out negligible values.

3. Data Processing Module: This module processes the cleaned data. Here, the percentages of each element and category are calculated based on a visual landscape classification framework.

4. Output Module: This module produces the final output. The results are then exported in Comma-Separated Values (CSV) format.

However, the given information does not explicitly mention the use of saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices as part of the postprocessing steps in LaDeco. Therefore, these specific elements may not be included in the postprocessing steps of LaDeco.
