The text does not explicitly mention which specific evaluation metrics are used to assess the performance of the deep learning model. However, based on the information given, we can infer that the authors use accuracy as a metric to measure the performance of their model. This is evident from Figures 9 and 10, which display the training and validation accuracies respectively. Additionally, Figure 11 shows a confusion matrix, which is another commonly used method to evaluate classification models. Although not mentioned directly, precision and recall might also have been considered, as they are often used alongside accuracy to gain a comprehensive understanding of a model's performance.
