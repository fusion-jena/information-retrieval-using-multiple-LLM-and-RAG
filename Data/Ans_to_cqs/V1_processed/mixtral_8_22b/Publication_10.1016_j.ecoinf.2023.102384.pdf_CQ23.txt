The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it mentions the use of a test split from the dataset, which suggests some form of data partitioning or splitting was employed. Data partitioning is often used to create training, validation, and testing sets, allowing models to be evaluated on unseen data and helping prevent overfitting. Additionally, the mention of a non-publicly available dataset implies that the authors may have had access to diverse data sources, contributing to the robustness and potential generalizability of their model. Nevertheless, without further details regarding the nature of the dataset, the exact methods used for data partitioning, or any additional techniques such as cross-validation or stratified sampling, we cannot definitively state what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
