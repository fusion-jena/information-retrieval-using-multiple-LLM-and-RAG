Based on the given context, the criterion used to determine when training is complete is not explicitly mentioned. However, we can infer from the information provided that the mean loss or simply 'loss' is an important metric considered during the training process. The mean loss is also the objective function that is minimized during model training. Additionally, the text mentions that learning of model parameters is done through optimization (minimization by convention) of an objective function that depends on the prediction goal. Optimization methods for neural network parameters are based on stochastic gradient descent algorithms, while the loss function gradient is approximated using the back-propagation algorithm. Therefore, one possible criterion for determining when training is complete might be reaching a certain threshold or stability in the mean loss value.
