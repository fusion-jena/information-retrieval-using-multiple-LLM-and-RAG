In the context of environmental data analysis using deep learning pipelines, raw data can be collected through various methods. These include the use of remote sensing technologies, such as Earth Observation Satellite (EOS) systems, which provide large volumes of data with diverse spatial and temporal characteristics. Users can access these data catalogues from platforms like the Google Earth Engine (GEE) online repository. This repository allows users to retrieve EOS data collections using constructors like ee.ImageCollection(), along with filters such as filterDate to limit the collection to a specific period. Additionally, the identified public image series or time series can undergo preprocessing and quality assurance (QA) band-based masking processes for each satellite. Other sources of raw data could include publicly available datasets, surveys, and sensor networks. However, the context does not explicitly mention these methods.
