The given context does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it discusses the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in various fields like bioinformatics, ecology, and environmental engineering. It also mentions the importance of selecting the right parameters when developing a robust ANN, including the number of layers, neurons, learning rates, and epochs. Overfitting and underfitting problems can occur due to improper parameter selection, so methods like early stopping and trial-and-error are employed to find the optimal configuration.
