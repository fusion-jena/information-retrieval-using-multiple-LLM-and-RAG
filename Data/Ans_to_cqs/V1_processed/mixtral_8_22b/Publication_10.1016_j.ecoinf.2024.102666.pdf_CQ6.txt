The text does not provide explicit information about the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, common practices include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization scales numeric columns to a range between 0 and 1, while scaling transforms features to have zero mean and unit variance. Cleaning involves handling missing values, outliers, or errors in the dataset. These techniques help improve the performance and convergence speed of machine learning algorithms.

Based on the context, it appears that the study focuses on atmospheric correction methods for satellite imagery, specifically addressing issues related to aerosol types and spatial factors. It mentions various models like L2gen, FLAASH, and ANN, but there is no direct reference to any specific preprocessing steps used before applying these models. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the exact preprocessing steps employed in this particular case.
