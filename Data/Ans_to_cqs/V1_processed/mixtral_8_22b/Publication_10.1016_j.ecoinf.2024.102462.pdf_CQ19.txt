Unfortunately, based on the given context, there isn't enough information to determine which specific framework was used to build the deep learning models mentioned in the text. The context only discusses the use of deep learning approaches and their application in solving certain tasks such as image classification, but does not mention any details about the implementation or development environment used to create these models. Therefore, without additional context, it cannot be determined whether frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or others were utilized.
