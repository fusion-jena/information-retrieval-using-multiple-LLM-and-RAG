The criterion used to determine when training is complete is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, there are some clues that suggest how this might be determined. For instance, the text mentions that each model undergoes training for 10 epochs, which could imply that training stops after a certain number of epochs have been completed. Additionally, the term 'predefined accuracy or loss threshold' is mentioned in relation to model convergence, suggesting that training may stop once a specific level of accuracy or loss has been achieved. It should be noted that these are only speculations based on the information available, and further clarification would be needed to provide a definitive answer.
