The papers cited do not directly discuss specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, they provide insights into various machine learning techniques applied to different domains like hydrology, water resource management, and ecological modeling.

Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function during training. Dropout is one type of regularization where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps reduce interdependent learning amongst them. This leads to better generalization when new unseen data is introduced.

L2 Regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a squared magnitude of weights as a penalty term to the loss function. By doing so, it discourages large weights, thus preventing any single feature from dominating the others.

While these specific regularization methods aren't explicitly mentioned in the given references, their principles align with the broader goal of improving model performance and avoiding overfitting. For instance, Frieden (1972) discusses restoring with maximum likelihood and maximum entropy, which can be seen as forms of regularization aimed at achieving optimal results while minimizing complexity. Similarly, Burg (1967) introduces maximum entropy spectral analysis, another form of regularization focusing on maintaining simplicity without compromising accuracy.

In conclusion, although the exact terms 'dropout' or 'L2 regularization' may not appear in the provided sources, understanding the concept of regularization and its role in preventing overfitting remains crucial across diverse fields employing machine learning techniques.
