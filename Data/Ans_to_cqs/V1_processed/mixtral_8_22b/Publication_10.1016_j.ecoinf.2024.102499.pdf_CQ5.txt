The study uses custom datasets consisting of baited underwater videos transformed into still images at a rate of 1 frame per second. The training data includes 8 shark species and 19 non-shark species commonly associated with sharks to add diversity in the training. Shark species that were infrequently captured in the clips were excluded from the testing phase. The resulting dataset consists of 26,947 fish annotations. No standard datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet were mentioned in the given context.
