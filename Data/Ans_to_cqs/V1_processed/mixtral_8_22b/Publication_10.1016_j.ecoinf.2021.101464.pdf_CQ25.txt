Based on the given information, it appears that the purpose of the deep learning model used in this study is not explicitly stated. However, we can infer from the context that the model being used is a Random Forest (RF) model, which is a type of ensemble machine learning algorithm. This model is used for both classification and regression tasks.

In this particular case, the RF model is being used to analyze the importance of various variables in relation to a certain outcome. The model is trained on several samples, and the importance scores of the selected variables are obtained through simulation. These scores are then used to rank the variables based on their significance.

From the results presented in Figure 3 and Table 4, we can see that the RF model has been able to explain a high percentage of the variance in the dataset (between 91% and 92%) and has achieved strong correlations between observed and predicted values (above 0.95). This suggests that the model is performing well in its task, although the specific nature of that task is not clearly defined in the provided context.

Therefore, while we cannot definitively state the exact purpose of the deep learning model in this study, we can conclude that it is likely being used for either classification or regression purposes within the domain of environmental science or ecology.
