Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does state that the authors adopted a ResNet-50 model for extracting image background features for classification, which implies that the dataset consists of images. Furthermore, these features were extracted from the fully connected layers pre-trained with the ImageNet database. This suggests that the authors might have used publicly available datasets, such as ImageNet, for gathering their raw data. Nevertheless, without further context, I cannot provide a definitive list of methods utilized for collecting raw data in this particular case.
