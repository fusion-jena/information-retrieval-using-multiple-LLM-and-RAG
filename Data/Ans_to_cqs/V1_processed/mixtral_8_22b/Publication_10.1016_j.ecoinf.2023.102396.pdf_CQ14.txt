Based on the given context, it appears that the optimization of the hyperparameters of the model was done using the R function `optim`. This function is used to maximize the likelihood function of state space models to estimate unknown parameters such as a, b, c, and σ²\_u for each rabbit population. However, the specific method of optimization within the `optim` function is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, without further information, we cannot definitively determine whether grid search, random search, or another method was used for hyperparameter optimization.
