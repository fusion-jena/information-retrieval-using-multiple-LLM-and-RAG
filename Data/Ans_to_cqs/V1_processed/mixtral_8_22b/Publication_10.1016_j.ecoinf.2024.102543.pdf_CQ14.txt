Based on the given information, there isn't any explicit mention of how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, whether through methods like grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, or others. However, it does state that the validation set was used during training to fine-tune hyperparameters. This implies that some form of hyperparameter tuning was performed, but the specific method remains unknown based solely on this text.
