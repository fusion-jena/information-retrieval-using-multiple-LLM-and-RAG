The given context does not provide information about any specific data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based solely on this context. However, some common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, and adding noise or blurring images. These techniques help increase the size and diversity of training datasets, which can improve model performance and generalization.
