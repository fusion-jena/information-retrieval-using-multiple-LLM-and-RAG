The text mentions that the validation set was used to tune the hyperparameters of the CNN. However, it does not specify the exact method used for optimization, such as grid search or random search. It also notes that the only hyperparameter of the k-NN is the value of k, which was fixed as k = 4 after testing several values. Therefore, while some form of hyperparameter tuning was performed, the specific optimization method used is not explicitly stated in the given context.
