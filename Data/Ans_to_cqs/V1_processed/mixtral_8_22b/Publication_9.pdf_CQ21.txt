The text does not provide explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it mentions that the VGG Image Annotator was used to manually annotate pixel coordinates to create precise polygonal mask contours directly around the fish body boundary. This suggests that one possible postprocessing step could involve comparing the predicted segmentation masks with the ground truth labels created through manual annotation.

Additionally, the text discusses the importance of considering the iterative nature of model training required to achieve performance suitable for one's specific needs. It highlights that users interested in refining the model for different use cases should anticipate iteratively training models with different sized training datasets and parameters until suitable performance is achieved. This implies that another potential postprocessing step could involve evaluating the performance of the model using various metrics and adjusting the training process accordingly.

Furthermore, the text notes that users should take care during manual annotation to ensure coordinates reflect a smooth boundary delineating the background pixels from the foreground pixels. This indicates that yet another possible postprocessing step might entail assessing the quality of the predicted segmentation masks and ensuring they accurately capture the desired features of the target object.

In summary, while the text does not explicitly state the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, it suggests several possibilities based on the described procedures and best practices. These include comparing predicted segmentation masks with ground truth labels, evaluating model performance using various metrics, and assessing the quality of predicted segmentation masks.
