The text does not provide specific information about the hyperparameters used in any deep learning model. It mentions that hyperparameter optimization was performed using both the random grid search and Bayesian optimization methods, but it does not specify what hyperparameters were adjusted or their values. The text also notes that deep learning algorithms were considered, but they were not used due to the limited number of samples. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information regarding the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
