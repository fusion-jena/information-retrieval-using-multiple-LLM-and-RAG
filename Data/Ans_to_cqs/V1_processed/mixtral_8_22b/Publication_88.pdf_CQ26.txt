In order to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. One such technique is stratified sampling, which involves dividing the dataset into subsets based on certain criteria, ensuring that each subset maintains the same distribution of target variables as the overall dataset. Another approach is oversampling, where additional instances of minority class examples are created to balance the dataset. Conversely, undersampling involves removing instances from the majority class to achieve a more balanced dataset. Additionally, diverse data collection can also help mitigate data bias by incorporating various sources and types of data, thus reducing overfitting and improving model generalization.
