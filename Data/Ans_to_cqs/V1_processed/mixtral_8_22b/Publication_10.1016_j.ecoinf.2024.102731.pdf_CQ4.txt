The given context does not provide information on the specific data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. However, some common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, zooming, shifting, shearing, and brightness adjustment. These techniques help increase the amount of training data available and improve the generalization performance of machine learning models by introducing variations into the dataset.

In the case of image data, flipping involves horizontally or vertically reversing the images. Rotating refers to turning the images around their center point by a certain degree. Scaling changes the size of the images, while zooming focuses on a particular area within the image. Shifting moves the entire image along one axis, either horizontally or vertically. Shearing distorts the shape of the image, creating a slanted effect. Brightness adjustment alters the overall lightness or darkness of the image.

These techniques can be combined and applied randomly during the training process to create even more diverse datasets. It is essential to choose appropriate data augmentation methods based on the nature of the problem and the characteristics of the input data.
