The information provided does not explicitly state whether GPUs were used during the training process. However, there is mention of a significant reduction in training time when using a machine equipped with a GPU compared to one without. This suggests that GPUs were likely utilized for accelerating the training process. Specifically, the passage states that training on a machine with a GPU took less than half an hour per epoch, whereas training on a Mac with a 2.4GHz processor and 64GB of memory took approximately 75 minutes per epoch. Therefore, it can be inferred that GPUs were indeed employed for training the deep learning model.
