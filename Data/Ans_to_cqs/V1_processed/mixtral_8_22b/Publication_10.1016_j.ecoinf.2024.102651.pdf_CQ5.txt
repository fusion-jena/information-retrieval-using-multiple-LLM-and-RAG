Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific details about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the experiments were conducted using different sizes of images, including "medium" and "small," and the entire dataset. It also notes that larger images tended to yield better classification outcomes. Therefore, while we cannot identify the exact datasets used, we can infer that they likely included various sizes of images.
