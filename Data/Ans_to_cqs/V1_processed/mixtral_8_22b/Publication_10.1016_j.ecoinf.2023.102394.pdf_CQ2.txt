Based on the given context, it is not explicitly mentioned what specific data format or types were used in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer that the study involves soil organic carbon (SOC) prediction, which suggests that the data could potentially include geospatial information, environmental variables, and other relevant factors related to soil properties. These data types may come in various formats such as raster images (e.g., satellite imagery), vector data (e.g., shapefiles), or tabular data (e.g., CSV files containing measurements and observations). It is important to note that the exact data formats used would depend on the specific implementation details of the deep learning model employed in the research.
