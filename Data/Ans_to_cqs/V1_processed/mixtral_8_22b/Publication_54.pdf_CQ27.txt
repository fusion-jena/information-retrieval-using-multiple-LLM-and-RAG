Unfortunately, the provided context does not contain information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. It only discusses the experimental settings, including the splitting of the dataset, the use of the Inception-ResNet-v2 model, the training parameters, and the application of transfer learning techniques. However, there is no mention of how the trained model was deployed, such as through model serialization or platform selection.
