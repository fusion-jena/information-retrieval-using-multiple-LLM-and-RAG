The performance of the deep learning model, specifically the U-Net-like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), is evaluated using two primary metrics: Overall Accuracy Score and Mean Intersection over Union (MeanIoU).

The Overall Accuracy Score is calculated as the ratio of correctly classified pixels to the total number of pixels. This provides a measure of how well the model can accurately predict the correct class for each pixel in the image.

On the other hand, Mean IoU is a more robust evaluation metric, especially useful in cases of class imbalance, which is often encountered in pixel-wise classification tasks like this one. It measures the overlap between the predicted and ground truth segments, providing a better understanding of the quality of the segmentation produced by the model. To compute Mean IoU, firstly, Mean IoU values are calculated for different threshold levels ranging from 0.5 to 1 with a step size of 0.05 using the MeanIoU function from the Keras library. These values are then averaged to obtain the final Mean IoU score.

These metrics help quantify the effectiveness of the model in performing accurate forest damage segmentation.
