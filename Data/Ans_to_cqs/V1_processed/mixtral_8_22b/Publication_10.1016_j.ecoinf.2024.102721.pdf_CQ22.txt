The paper does not explicitly mention the specific evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of their deep learning models. However, it does discuss using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, which is commonly evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), or coefficient of determination (R^2) for regression tasks. For classification tasks, common metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Given the nature of the problem discussed in the paper - forecasting ecological water demand - it is likely that they use regression metrics such as MAE, RMSE, or R^2 to evaluate their LSTM model.
