The text does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, it mentions that the study evaluates the classification results of the proposed model with different training data ratios, starting from 10% to 90%, increasing by 10%. This suggests that the authors might have used a simple random sampling approach to divide the dataset into training and testing sets based on varying percentages. Nevertheless, without further details, it cannot be confirmed if any specific criteria were applied during the splitting process.
