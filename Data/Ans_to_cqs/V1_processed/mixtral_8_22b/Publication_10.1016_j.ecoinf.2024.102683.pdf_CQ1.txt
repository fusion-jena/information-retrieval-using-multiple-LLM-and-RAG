The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses various techniques related to deep learning, such as data augmentation, attention mechanisms, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These techniques are applied after obtaining the raw data, rather than being involved in the collection process itself. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer to your query based on the given context.
