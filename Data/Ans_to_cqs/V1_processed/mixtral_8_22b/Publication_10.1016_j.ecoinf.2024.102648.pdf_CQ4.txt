The given context does not provide information about the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. However, it mentions that machine learning and deep learning tools like bootstrap forest, boosted tree, and artificial neural networks were used to forecast the percent disease incidence of Cotton Leaf Curl Disease (CLCuD) using various weather parameters. It also discusses how these computational techniques have been used in biological sciences for accurate predictions by identifying correlation patterns between input and output datasets. Therefore, while we cannot determine the exact data augmentation techniques used in this case, it is common practice in deep learning pipelines to use techniques like flipping, rotation, and scaling to increase the amount of training data available and prevent overfitting.
