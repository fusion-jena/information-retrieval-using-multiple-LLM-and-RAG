The purpose of the deep learning models used in this study is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the description of the architectures and their components, it appears that these models are being used for multi-class image classification tasks. Specifically, both AlexNet and GoogLeNet architectures are employed, each consisting of multiple convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers. The final layer in both architectures is a softmax layer, which produces a probability distribution over the 38 output classes. This suggests that the goal of these models is to classify images into one of the 38 predefined categories. Additionally, the use of transfer learning and training from scratch indicates that the authors may be interested in comparing the performance of different training strategies for these classification tasks.
