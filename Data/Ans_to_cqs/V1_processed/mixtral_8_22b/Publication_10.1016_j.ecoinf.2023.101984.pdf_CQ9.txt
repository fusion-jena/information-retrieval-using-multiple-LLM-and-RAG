The data repository of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, it can be inferred that the occurrence data for the two oak species, Quercus ilex subsp. ilex and Quercus pubescens Willd, was obtained from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) online database. Therefore, it can be assumed that the data repository for this specific study might have been GBIF. Nevertheless, without further information or confirmation, it cannot be definitively stated that the deep learning pipeline data repository is also hosted on GBIF.
