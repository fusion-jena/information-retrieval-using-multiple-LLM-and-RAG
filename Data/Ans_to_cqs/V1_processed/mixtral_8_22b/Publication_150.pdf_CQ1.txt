The context does not provide explicit details about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of ImageNet, a large-scale hierarchical image database, as one source of data [32]. Additionally, there is mention of data augmentation techniques being applied to improve model performance [33], suggesting that existing datasets may have been expanded upon or modified during preprocessing stages. Unfortunately, without additional context, we cannot definitively state what methods are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
