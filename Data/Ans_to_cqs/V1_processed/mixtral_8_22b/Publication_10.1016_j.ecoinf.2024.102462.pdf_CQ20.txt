Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no information about which specific hardware resources were used for training the deep learning models mentioned. Deep learning models often require significant computational resources, including CPUs, GPUs, or even specialized hardware like TPUs (Tensor Processing Units), but without explicit mention in the text, I cannot definitively determine what was used in these cases.
