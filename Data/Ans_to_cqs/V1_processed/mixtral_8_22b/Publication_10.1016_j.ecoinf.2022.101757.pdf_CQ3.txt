The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that semantic segmentation, also known as pixel-wise classification, was employed to locate and delineate artificial and natural objects in photos. Semantic segmentation involves assigning each pixel in an image to a class label, thus providing more precise localization compared to other annotation techniques like bounding boxes. In addition, the use of open image datasets, specifically the COCO dataset, suggests that various annotation techniques might have been utilized during its creation, including bounding box annotation and instance segmentation. The COCO dataset contains over 120,000 images and includes multiple instances per image, making it suitable for tasks requiring both object detection and segmentation. Therefore, while the exact data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned, it can be assumed that they include semantic segmentation, bounding box annotation, and instance segmentation.
