Based on the provided context, it appears there might be some confusion regarding the nature of the information requested. The context primarily discusses the use of computing tools, such as the DAFNE HPC scientific computing center, and the application of a hybrid Genetic Algorithm - Least Squares method combined with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to estimate model parameters. However, there is no explicit mention or discussion of any deep learning models or their evaluation metrics. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, I cannot provide a direct answer to the query about what metrics are used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. Commonly used metrics for evaluating deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC, etc., depending on the type of problem being addressed.
