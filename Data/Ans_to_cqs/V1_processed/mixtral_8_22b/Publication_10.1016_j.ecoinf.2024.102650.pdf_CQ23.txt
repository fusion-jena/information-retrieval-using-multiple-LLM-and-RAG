The paper does not provide specific information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model used in this study. However, it mentions that machine learning methods require text preprocessing, such as word segmentation and stop word removal, which are common steps in preparing datasets for training and testing machine learning models. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of the Enhanced Representation through Knowledge Integration (ERNIE) model, which has been shown to perform well in various Chinese language tasks, including a mixed-language emotional analysis task. This suggests that the authors may have considered the diversity of their dataset when selecting a suitable deep learning model. Nevertheless, without explicit mention of techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting, it is difficult to determine the exact measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model in this study.
