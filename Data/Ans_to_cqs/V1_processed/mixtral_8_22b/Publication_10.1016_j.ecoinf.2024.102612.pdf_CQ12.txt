The text does not explicitly mention the specific type of Deep Learning (DL) model used in the pipeline. However, it mentions that the best classification performance of the SoftGroup semantic branch was achieved by the Multispectral (MS) input data case. It also refers to using DL models like U-Net and Deeplabv3+ for semantic classifications. These models are both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), suggesting that the pipeline might use some form of CNN architecture. Nevertheless, without explicit confirmation, we cannot definitively state that the pipeline exclusively employs CNN architectures.
