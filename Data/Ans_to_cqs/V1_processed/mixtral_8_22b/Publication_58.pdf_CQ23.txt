To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning models, several measures were taken during the development process. One such measure was the use of diverse datasets. The study utilized five distinct study areas, each containing various landscapes representing the New Caledonian environment, including urban, mining, mountainous, and forest environments. These varied landscapes helped create a more comprehensive and diverse dataset, which improved the model's ability to generalize across different scenarios.

Additionally, the dataset was split into three mutually exclusive parts: a learning set, a validation set, and a test set. This separation allowed for proper evaluation of the model's performance and prevented overfitting, ensuring that the model could perform well on unseen data. Specifically, four of the five areas were used for learning and validation, while the fifth, isolated scene was reserved exclusively for testing. This independent test set contained all the classes for both nomenclatures, making it representative of real-world conditions and further enhancing the model's generalizability.

Moreover, the final confusion matrix and quality metrics were computed using the entire test scene, encompassing all the environments present in the New Caledonian landscape. By evaluating the model's performance on this comprehensive test set, researchers could assess its ability to accurately classify land cover and land use types across diverse environmental settings.

In summary, the study employed multiple strategies to enhance the generalizability of the deep learning models. These included utilizing diverse datasets, separating the data into distinct sets for learning, validation, and testing, and evaluating the model's performance on a comprehensive test set that represented the full range of New Caledonian landscapes.
