The given context does not provide information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only discusses the application of pre-trained CNN image representations extracted from VGGnet to a coral reef classification problem, along with some experimental results and conclusions. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the location of the code repository based solely on the provided context.
