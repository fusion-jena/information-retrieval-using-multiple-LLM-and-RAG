The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred from the context that the model is used for image classification tasks. Specifically, the model is employed to classify herbarium specimens and non-dried plant images. The experiments conducted measure the accuracy of the trained deep learning model under various circumstances, such as herbarium specimens classification, cross-herbaria transfer learning, and transfer learning from herbarium data to non-dried plant images. These experiments suggest that the primary goal of the deep learning model is to aid taxonomists and experts in their annotation, classification, and revision work at herbariums.
