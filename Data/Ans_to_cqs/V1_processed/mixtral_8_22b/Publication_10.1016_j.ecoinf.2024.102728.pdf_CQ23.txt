Based on the given context, there is no explicit information about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model mentioned in Mohedano et al.'s paper (2017). However, some common methods used to improve the generalizability of deep learning models include using diverse datasets, cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other techniques such as regularization, dropout, or transfer learning. Without further details, it cannot be confirmed which of these methods were employed in this particular study.
