Based on the given context, it does not directly discuss specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, some general insights about handling data in deep learning models can be derived from the information available.

For instance, in section 5.2, the authors mention setting the sampling rate to 0.1 when training their Random Forest Classifier (RFC) model. This could potentially indicate the usage of subsampling or downsampling techniques to handle class imbalance issues in the dataset. Additionally, they specify the number of decision trees to 20 and the number of features used to train the random forest to 9, which suggests feature selection and parameter tuning processes aimed at reducing overfitting and improving model performance.

Furthermore, in section 4.3.3, the authors compare the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model with other traditional machine learning models like the Backpropagation (BP) model and the Markov Chain model. While this comparison doesn't explicitly refer to addressing data bias, it highlights the importance of selecting suitable algorithms based on the characteristics of the input data and the nature of the problem being solved.

Lastly, in section 4.4.1, the authors briefly touch upon the concept of Multiobjective Programming (MOP) models, which can be employed to optimize land allocation decisions while considering various objectives and constraints. Although this isn't directly related to data preprocessing, it emphasizes the significance of incorporating domain knowledge and expert opinions into the modeling process to ensure fairness and accuracy.

Overall, while the given context does not offer explicit details regarding techniques used to mitigate data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, it provides valuable insights into aspects such as class balancing, feature engineering, algorithm selection, and optimization methods that contribute towards building robust and reliable predictive models.
