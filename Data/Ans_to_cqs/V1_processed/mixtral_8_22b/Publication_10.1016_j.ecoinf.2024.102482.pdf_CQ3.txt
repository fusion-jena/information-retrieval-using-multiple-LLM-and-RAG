Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot give a direct answer to your query. However, generally speaking, some commonly used data annotation techniques in deep learning include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, landmark annotation, and key point annotation. Each technique serves different purposes depending on the type of dataset and problem being addressed. For example, bounding box annotation is often used for object detection tasks, while semantic segmentation is useful for pixel-level classification tasks. Instance segmentation combines both object detection and semantic segmentation to identify individual objects within an image. Polygon annotation is typically used for irregularly shaped objects, whereas landmark and key point annotations are employed for facial recognition and pose estimation tasks.
