The given context does not provide specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions several studies related to remote sensing, image processing, and environmental science where various types of satellite imagery have been employed. For instance, Hanintyo et al. (2021) use Landsat 8 data, while He et al. (2013) utilize geostationary satellite ocean color data. Additionally, Ecological Informatics (2024) discusses the application of convolutional neural networks for water body extraction from Sentinel-2 images. Therefore, it can be inferred that these studies might involve datasets derived from satellite imagery sources like Landsat, Sentinel-2, or other similar platforms. Nevertheless, without explicit mention of well-known benchmark datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, we cannot definitively state which datasets were used in their respective deep learning pipelines.
