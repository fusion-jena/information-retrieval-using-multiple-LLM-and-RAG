A two-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) is used in the pipeline for classifying spectrograms. This CNN is built using the Python package Keras with a TensorFlow backend. It consists of four convolutional layers, each having a 3x3 kernel. The first two layers have 64 filters, while the last two have 128 filters. After each convolution block, there is a batch normalization layer and a max pooling layer. The network parameters are chosen using the Python optimization library Hyperopt, which uses an oriented random search to compare the results of training the network on various parameter combinations.
