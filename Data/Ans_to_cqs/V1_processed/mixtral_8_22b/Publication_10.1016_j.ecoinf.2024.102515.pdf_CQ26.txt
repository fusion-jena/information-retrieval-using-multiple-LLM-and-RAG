Based on the given context, the study uses a 'Full-archive search endpoint' to access the entire dataset published on Twitter from its beginning in 2006-2007 until the end of 2022. The twarc2 library is used to handle the data in JSON format returned by the Twitter API. The API searches for words, hashtags, or combinations of both in the text of tweets. However, the context does not provide specific details on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, based on the given context, I do not know what techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
