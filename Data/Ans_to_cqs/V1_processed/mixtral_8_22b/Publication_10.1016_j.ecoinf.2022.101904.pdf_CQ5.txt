The paper does not explicitly mention any specific dataset used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of a wetland dataset for large-scale wetland mapping. Additionally, Fig. 8 shows examples of wetland classification maps in different locations using various methods like Vision Transformer (ViT), Swin Transformer, CoAtNet, and the proposed end-to-end algorithm. Furthermore, Fig. 9 demonstrates the extraction of features from an urban (road) object using three convolutional layers of the CNN network. Therefore, while the exact dataset names are not mentioned, it appears that the authors utilize both wetland and urban datasets in their study.
