The text does not explicitly mention the specific cloud platform used to host the trained model. However, it mentions that the trained model is served through a public-facing website developed by the authors. This suggests that they might have used their own custom web server or hosting service rather than a popular cloud provider like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. Therefore, without further information, we cannot definitively determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
