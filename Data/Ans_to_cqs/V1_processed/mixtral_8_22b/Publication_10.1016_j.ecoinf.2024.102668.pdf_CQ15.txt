The given context does not provide information on specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) applied in a deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses the application of ecoacoustic indices (EAIs) in site comparisons and how they can be affected by device biases. To address this issue, the authors propose a comprehensive processing pipeline that reduces device bias, making EAIs more applicable to fields like machine learning and deep learning. While the text does not explicitly mention optimization techniques, it is important to note that in general, deep learning pipelines often employ optimization algorithms like SGD, Adam, or others to minimize loss functions during training. These methods help improve model accuracy and convergence speed.
