Based on the provided context, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training include a 10-fold cross-validation method. This method was employed to ensure a reliable estimate of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) on the test set. Additionally, the models being probabilistic in nature, each evaluation predicted the output per test point through 1000 runs. This approach aimed to provide an accurate reconstruction of the predicted output distribution by guaranteeing a robust estimation process with a 95% confidence interval and a precision level of 5%. Furthermore, the dropout rate for the MCD network was determined using a 10-fold cross-validation method utilizing both the training and validation subsets. However, the exact proportions or specific methods used to divide the dataset into training, testing, and validation sets were not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
