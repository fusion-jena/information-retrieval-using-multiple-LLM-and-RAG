The purpose of the deep learning model used in this study is object detection. Specifically, it aims to detect ocean objects using synthetic aperture radar (SAR). The model employed is called YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once version 3), which is a real-time object detection system. It uses a single neural network to predict bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation, unlike other systems that require multiple stages or passes over the same image. This makes YOLOv3 much faster than its counterparts, achieving high accuracy even when dealing with complex backgrounds and difficult circumstances.
