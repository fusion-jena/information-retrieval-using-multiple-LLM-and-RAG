Based on the given information, the study primarily focuses on using images for training the EfficientNet model. Specifically, they use 4000 images per category, applying data augmentation techniques such as combining masked foreground images with background images without insects. They mention preparing these images for both training and validation purposes. Therefore, the primary data format used in their deep learning pipeline is images. However, there is no explicit mention of other data formats like audio, video, or CSV files being utilized in their work.
