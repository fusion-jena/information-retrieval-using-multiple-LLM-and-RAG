The text does not provide explicit information about specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model. However, it mentions two techniques that can be considered part of preprocessing or regularization during training: batch normalization and dropout. Batch normalization involves standardizing the inputs in each mini-batch to have zero mean and unit variance, which helps stabilize the learning process and reduce generalization error. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent overfitting by making the network more robust to the removal of any single feature. Although these techniques occur during training rather than beforehand, they contribute to improving the overall quality and reliability of the model. Other common preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning may have been performed but were not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
