The paper by Halgamuge et al. (2020) focuses on utilizing deep learning to estimate the best optimizer selection methods for wildfire event predictions in Australia. However, the specific type of deep learning model used in their pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the information provided whether they used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Transformer, or another type of deep learning model.
