The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it mentions that five different versions of the YOLOv5 model family were independently trained, including YOLOv5n, YOLOv5s, YOLOv5m, YOLOv5l, and YOLOv5x models. These models are known to utilize various optimization techniques during their training phase. For instance, the YOLOv5 architecture typically employs the Adam optimizer for weight updates, but this may vary depending on the specific implementation or configuration. Therefore, while the exact optimization technique used in this case cannot be determined from the provided context, it is reasonable to infer that some form of optimization technique, possibly Adam or another popular choice like SGD, would have been employed during the training of these models.
