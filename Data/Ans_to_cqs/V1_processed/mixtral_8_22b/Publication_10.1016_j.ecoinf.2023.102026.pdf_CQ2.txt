The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information given, it appears that the study uses camera trap data, which typically consists of images or videos captured automatically when motion is detected. Therefore, it can be inferred that the data format used in this case would likely be either image or video files. Additionally, the text mentions the use of Random Forest (RF) algorithm, which suggests that the data may also include structured data such as CSV files containing features extracted from the camera trap data.
