After the model training, several postprocessing steps can be taken to evaluate the performance of the proposed EMViT-Net model. These include:

1. Calculating performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score are calculated using unseen test sets of the dataset to assess the overall performance of the model.

2. Feature fusion and classification: Extracted features from the microbe images are passed through a multilayer perceptron (MLP) module for final feature fusion and classification. This step helps in making the final predictions based on the learned features.

3. Residual connections: A residual connection is applied after the transformer block to improve the performance of the network. By skipping some connections, this technique allows the network to reach the final output layer more efficiently.

However, it should be noted that the provided context does not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing techniques such as saliency maps or confusion matrices. Therefore, these methods may not necessarily apply to the EMViT-Net model described here.
