Regularization methods are techniques used in machine learning and deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. Two common regularization methods mentioned in the given context are dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to reduce interdependent learning amongst them. This leads to a more robust model that generalizes better to unseen data. Dropout works by setting a fraction rate (usually between 0.2 to 0.5) of input units to 0 at each update during training time, which helps prevent overfitting.

On the other hand, L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty equivalent to the square of the magnitude of coefficients to the loss function. By doing so, it encourages smaller weights, leading to simpler models that are less prone to overfitting. L2 regularization is often used in linear regression models but can also be applied to deep learning architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).

Other regularization methods include L1 regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation. L1 regularization, also called Lasso Regression, adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients to the loss function. Early stopping involves monitoring the validation error while training and halting the process once the error starts increasing, indicating overfitting. Data augmentation generates new training samples by applying transformations to existing ones, effectively increasing the dataset size and reducing overfitting risk.
