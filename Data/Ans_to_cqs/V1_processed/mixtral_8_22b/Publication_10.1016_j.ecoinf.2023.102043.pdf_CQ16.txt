The provided context does not explicitly mention any criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, common machine learning practices often use metrics such as validation loss plateaus, accuracy thresholds, or early stopping rules to decide when a model has been sufficiently trained. Without further information, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the specific criteria used in this case.
