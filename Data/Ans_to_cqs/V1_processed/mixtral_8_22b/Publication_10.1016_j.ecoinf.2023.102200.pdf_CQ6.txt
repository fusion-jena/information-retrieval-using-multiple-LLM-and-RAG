The context does not provide explicit information about specific preprocessing steps taken before training a deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that some form of labeling or annotation is performed on the input data, such as bounding boxes around individual mangrove trees, low shrubs, and other classes on BEV images. This process is crucial for supervised learning tasks like object detection, where labeled data is required to train models like Faster R-CNN. Additionally, the use of Stochastic Gradient Descent optimization algorithm suggests that the input features might have been normalized or standardized to ensure better convergence during training. Lastly, the initialization of the network with weights developed from training based on the MS COCO dataset indicates transfer learning, which is another common preprocessing step in deep learning applications.
