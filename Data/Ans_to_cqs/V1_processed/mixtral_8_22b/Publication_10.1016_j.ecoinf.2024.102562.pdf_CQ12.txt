The text mentions that the authors use Mask R-CNN, which stands for Mask Region Convolutional Neural Network. This indicates that they employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) based architecture for their deep learning model. Additionally, they also mention using the ResNet-101 network, which is another variant of a CNN. Therefore, both instances suggest that the authors utilize CNN models in their pipeline.
