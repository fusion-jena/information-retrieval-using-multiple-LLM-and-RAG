To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, due to limited training data availability within the specific audio domain, the researchers explored different network sizes along with pre-training using additional acoustic reference data from outside of their audio domain. This approach helped expose the model to diverse acoustic patterns, potentially improving its ability to generalize across various scenarios.

Secondly, the researchers employed a stratified sampling strategy when preparing datasets for fine-tuning the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) models. They randomly selected 50 Regions Of Interest (ROIs) per species with 'presence' to create a held-out test set for assessing accuracy. The remaining ROIs with species presence were utilized for fine-tuning the CNN models. To further validate the model's performance, they created separate validation and training sets. A random selection of 100 ROIs per species was allocated to the validation set, while the rest formed the training set. This method ensured that both the validation and training sets contained representative samples from all classes (species), thereby promoting better generalization capabilities.

Lastly, the researchers took steps to prevent temporal autocorrelation in their validation and test data. When dealing with overlapping ROIs from different pattern-matching runs for a given species, they assigned such instances to the training set. By doing this, they aimed to minimize potential biases caused by similarities between adjacent or temporally close segments, thus enhancing the model's capacity to generalize effectively.
