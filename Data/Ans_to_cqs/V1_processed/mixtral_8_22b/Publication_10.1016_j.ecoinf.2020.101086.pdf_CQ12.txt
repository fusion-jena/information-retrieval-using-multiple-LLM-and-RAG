The given text does not provide information about the use of any specific deep learning model like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. Instead, it discusses Species Distribution Models (SDMs) and their performance based on factors such as sample size, sampling bias, and correction methods. Therefore, I cannot determine what type of deep learning model is used in this case.
