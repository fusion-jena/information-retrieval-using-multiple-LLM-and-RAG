The given context does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model. However, it mentions some aspects related to the architecture of the model, including the use of MBBlocks, stem layer, and head layer in the WildARe-YOLO model. It also discusses the parameter amount calculation using k2.Cin.Cout, where k2 represents the convolutional kernel size, Cin denotes the number of input channels, and Cout stands for the number of output channels. Additionally, the text refers to the computational cost and parameters of a single layer, measured in FLOPs, and the importance of estimating and controlling the total requirements of the model. Nevertheless, without explicit details regarding the hyperparameters, one cannot determine the exact values used in this particular deep learning model.
