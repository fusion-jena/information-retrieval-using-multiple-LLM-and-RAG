To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed. One common approach is to use fixed random seeds during development and experimentation. This ensures reproducibility by making sure that the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers is generated each time the code is executed. Another strategy is to perform multiple runs with different random seeds and then average the results to reduce variance caused by random initialization. Additionally, techniques such as dropout regularization and batch normalization can help mitigate the effects of randomness in neural networks. Lastly, it is important to carefully design experiments and interpret results while considering the inherent stochasticity of deep learning algorithms.
