The papers cited primarily focus on computer vision applications in agriculture, specifically for detecting and recognizing pests such as aphids, whiteflies, and thrips. The primary data format used in these studies is digital images or videos of crops and pests. These visual datasets are then processed through deep learning pipelines, often involving convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Some examples include Yu and Koltun's work on multi-scale context aggregation by dilated convolutions, Simonyan and Zisserman's research on very deep convolutional networks for large-scale image recognition, and Ren et al.'s paper on faster R-CNN for real-time object detection. Additionally, Wang et al.'s study introduces a dataset called Pest24, which consists of a large-scale collection of images featuring agricultural pests. Overall, the main data format utilized in these deep learning pipelines is digital imagery.
