Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific details about the dataset used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the network was trained on a relatively small number of examples, which is often the case in ecology datasets. It also references a case study involving the Hainan gibbon. Therefore, it can be inferred that the dataset used might have been related to ecological or biological data, possibly containing images or audio recordings of various bird species. However, without explicit mention of the dataset name, it cannot be confirmed if popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet were utilized in this particular deep learning pipeline.
