In the given context, the criterion used to determine when training is complete is not explicitly mentioned. However, it does provide information about how the dataset is split into training and testing sets, with 80% of the data being used for training and the remaining 20% for testing. The training set is further subjected to hyperparameter optimization using GridSearchCV from scikit-learn, with a five-fold cross-validation and negative mean squared error as the target measure. After this optimization process, the performance metrics are evaluated using the test set. Based on these performance metrics, the most effective models for each target variable are selected. Therefore, it can be inferred that the completion of training might depend on achieving optimal hyperparameters or reaching a satisfactory level of performance according to the chosen evaluation metrics.
