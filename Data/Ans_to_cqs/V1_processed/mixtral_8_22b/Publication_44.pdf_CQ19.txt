The text does not provide explicit information about the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models mentioned, such as DeepLabv3 or Faster R-CNN. However, these models are commonly implemented using popular deep learning libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch. For instance, TensorFlow provides pre-trained models for DeepLabv3, and PyTorch has various implementations of Faster R-CNN available. Without additional context, I cannot definitively state which frameworks were used to build these models in this case.
