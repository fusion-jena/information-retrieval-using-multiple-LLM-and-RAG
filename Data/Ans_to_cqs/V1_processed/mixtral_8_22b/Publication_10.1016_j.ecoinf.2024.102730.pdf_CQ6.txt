The given context does not provide explicit information about any preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model. However, based on common practices in machine learning, some possible preprocessing steps could include:

* Normalization: Scaling numerical inputs to a range such as [0, 1] or [-1, 1]. This helps prevent large input values from dominating the learning process.
* Standardization: Transforming numerical inputs so they have zero mean and unit variance. This can help improve convergence during optimization.
* Cleaning: Removing missing or invalid values from the dataset, handling outliers, and dealing with inconsistent formatting.
* Encoding categorical variables: Converting non-numerical categories into numerical representations suitable for machine learning algorithms. Techniques like one-hot encoding or ordinal encoding may be employed.

These preprocessing steps were not explicitly mentioned in the provided context but are commonly applied when preparing datasets for deep learning models.
