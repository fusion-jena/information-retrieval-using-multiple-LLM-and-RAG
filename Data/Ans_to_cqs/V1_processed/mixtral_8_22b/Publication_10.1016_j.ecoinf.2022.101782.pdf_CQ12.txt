Two types of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used in the pipeline. The first one is a ResNet101 object detection model, which is initialized with pretrained COCO weights and can detect 80 generic object classes including 'bird'. The second one is a ResNet50 red kite model, which is trained using transfer-learning on the citizen science data. Both models have different sizes and complexities due to their layer differences; ResNet101 has double the amount of layers compared to ResNet50.
