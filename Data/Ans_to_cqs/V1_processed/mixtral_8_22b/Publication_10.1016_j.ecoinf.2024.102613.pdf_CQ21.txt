The text does not provide information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, some possible postprocessing steps include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, and creating confusion matrices. These steps can help evaluate the performance of the trained model and identify areas for improvement.

Based on the given context, here are the answers to questions 24, 25, and 26:

24. For data preprocessing, you may need several features including data deduplication, data cleansing, data transformation, and data compression. Data deduplication eliminates excessive copies of data, while data cleansing removes incorrect, corrupted, or incomplete data. Data transformation changes the structure or format of data, and data compression modifies or converts the bits structure of data.

25. In data processing, there are different approaches to choose from based on the availability of labeled data. You could use well-labeled training data (supervised), combine labeled with unlabeled training data (semi-supervised), or use unlabeled training data (unsupervised). Your choice depends on the nature of your dataset and the problem you want to solve.

26. Depending on your analytical goals, you might need different kinds of data analytics. Descriptive analytics helps you understand what happened, diagnostic analytics explains why something happened, predictive analytics forecasts what will happen, and prescriptive analytics suggests actions to take when something happens.
