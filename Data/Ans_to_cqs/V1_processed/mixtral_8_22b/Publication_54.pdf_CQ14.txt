In the given context, it is mentioned that the model uses fivefold cross-validation and early stopping for efficient hyperparameter optimization. However, the specific method for selecting the values of the hyperparameters is not explicitly stated. Grid search and random search are common methods for hyperparameter optimization, but they are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.
