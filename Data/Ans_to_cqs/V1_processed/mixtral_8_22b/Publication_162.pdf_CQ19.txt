The text does not provide information about which specific deep learning framework was used to build the D-Mask R-CNN architecture mentioned in the research paper. Therefore, it cannot be determined if popular frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch were utilized.

The given context primarily focuses on describing the methodologies employed in the research, such as normalizing input channels, introducing a feature fusion module, and evaluating the performance of D-Mask R-CNN using metrics like Average Precision (AP), AP50, and AP75. Additionally, several references are listed, but they do not explicitly mention any particular deep learning framework either.
