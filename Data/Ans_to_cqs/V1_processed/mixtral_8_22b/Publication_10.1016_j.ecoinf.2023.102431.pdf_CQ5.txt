The study does not mention any specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it focuses on creating a custom dataset using camera trap images of fisher and marten tracks. The researchers collected 167 marten and 367 fisher tracks (including both male and female individuals), and used these tracks to extract 124 morphometric variables for use in their linear discriminant analyses. These variables included distances, angles, and areas derived from the tracks. Therefore, the datasets used in this study were specifically created by the authors for the purpose of classifying species and sex based on animal tracks.
