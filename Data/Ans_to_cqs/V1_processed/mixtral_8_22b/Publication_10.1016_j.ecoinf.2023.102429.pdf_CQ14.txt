Based on the given information, it appears that the Support Vector Machine Regression (SVMR) model uses optimal parameters such as cost C, epsilon p, and gamma g to achieve the best accuracy. However, the text does not explicitly mention how these hyperparameters are optimized, whether through methods like grid search or random search. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the specific optimization technique employed for this particular case.
