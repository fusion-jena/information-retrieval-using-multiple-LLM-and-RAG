For the purpose of training and testing a deep learning model, the dataset is typically divided into three subsets: 'training', 'validation', and 'test'. The 'training' subset is used to build the initial model, where the model learns patterns within the data. The 'validation' subset is utilized during the training process to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model becomes too complex and starts fitting the noise in the training data instead of generalizing the underlying pattern. By using the 'validation' subset, the model can be evaluated periodically throughout the training process to ensure it maintains its ability to generalize. Lastly, the 'test' subset is employed once the final model has been trained to evaluate its overall performance and accuracy. It provides an unbiased evaluation of the model since it hasn't seen these data before.
