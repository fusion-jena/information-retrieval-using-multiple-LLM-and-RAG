Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to provide a detailed answer about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the implementation and training of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) were done using Python programming language along with Keras and TensorFlow libraries. Additionally, the computations were carried out using CUDA version 9.1 and CuDNN with Nvidia P100 accelerator cards having 12GB of GPU memory.

As for the specific details regarding the deployment process such as model serialization or platform selection, these are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide any further insights into those aspects.
