Based on the given context, one technique used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline is data resampling. This technique involves adjusting the class distribution of the dataset to create a more balanced representation of each class. In this case, the authors used data resampling to create a new model with six evenly distributed classes. However, this resulted in a decrease in validation accuracy due to the smaller data size. Another approach mentioned in the context is the use of diverse data collection methods, such as collecting images of six different butterfly families with similar image sizes and numbers. This ensures that the dataset is representative of all classes and reduces any potential bias towards certain classes. Additionally, the authors note that it is possible to use small datasets to train deep learning models effectively, as long as the proper parameters are selected. Overall, the context suggests that addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline requires careful consideration of class distribution and diversity within the dataset.
