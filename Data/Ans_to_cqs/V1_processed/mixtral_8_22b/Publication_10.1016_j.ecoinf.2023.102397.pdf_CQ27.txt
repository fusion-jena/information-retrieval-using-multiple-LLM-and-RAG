The provided context does not contain specific information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, based on common practices in machine learning projects, after training a deep learning model, it is typically serialized into a format such as.h5 (HDF5) or.onnx (Open Neural Network Exchange) using libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. This serialized model can then be loaded onto various platforms for inference, depending on the project requirements. These platforms could include cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure, edge devices, mobile applications, or web servers. Unfortunately, without further details from the given context, I cannot provide a precise description of the deployment process for this particular deep learning model.
