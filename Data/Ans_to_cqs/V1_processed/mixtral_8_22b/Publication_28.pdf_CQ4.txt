The given context does not provide information about the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, translation, and adding noise. These techniques help increase the amount of training data available and improve the generalization ability of the model. It would require additional context or information to determine if any of these techniques were specifically used in this case.
