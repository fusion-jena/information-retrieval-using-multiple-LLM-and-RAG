The given text does not provide information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the Caffe framework was used for training the model. Caffe is known to support both GPU and CPU computations, so it can be inferred that either GPUs or CPUs could have been used for training the model. Without explicit mention of the hardware resources used, it cannot be definitively stated whether GPUs, TPUs, or any other specific hardware resource was utilized for training the deep learning model.
