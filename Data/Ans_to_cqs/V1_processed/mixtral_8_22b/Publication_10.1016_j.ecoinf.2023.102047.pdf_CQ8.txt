The information provided does not explicitly mention where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query. However, it can be noted that the authors mentioned using TensorFlow Object Detection API, which suggests that they might have used publicly available resources or libraries. It would be best to refer to the original research paper or contact the authors directly for more detailed information about the availability of the code repository.
