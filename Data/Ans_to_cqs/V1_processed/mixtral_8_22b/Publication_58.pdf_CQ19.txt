Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to determine which specific frameworks were used to build the deep learning models mentioned in the given context. The text only provides details about the architectures such as AlexNet, DenseNet, and DeepLab but does not mention any particular framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer to this query based solely on the given context.
