The text does not provide explicit information about the method used to optimize the hyperparameters of the model. However, it mentions that the hyperparameters were set empirically, which suggests that some form of trial-and-error or iterative optimization may have been employed. This could include methods such as grid search or random search, but without further specifics, it cannot be definitively stated which method was used.
