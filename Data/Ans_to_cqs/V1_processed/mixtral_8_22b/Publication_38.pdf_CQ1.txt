The method utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is through full-spectrum time-expanded (TE) ultrasonic acoustic data recorded between 2005-2011 along road-transects by citizen scientists as part of the Indicator Bats Programme (iBats). Acoustic devices (Tranquility Transect, Courtplan Design Ltd, UK) were set to record using a TE factor of 10, a sampling time of 320ms, and sensitivity set on maximum, resulting in a continuous sequence of'snapshots', consisting of 320ms of silence (sensor listening) and 3.2s of TE audio (sensor playing back x 10). With sensitivity set at maximum and no minimum amplitude trigger mechanism used on the recording devices, the recorded audio data contained many instances of low amplitude and faint bat calls, as well as other night-time 'background' noises such as other biotic, abiotic, and anthropogenic sounds.
