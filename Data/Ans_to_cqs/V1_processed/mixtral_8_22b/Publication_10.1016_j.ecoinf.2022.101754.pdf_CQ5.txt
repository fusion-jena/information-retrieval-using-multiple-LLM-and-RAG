Based on the provided context, it is not explicitly stated what specific datasets were used in the deep learning pipeline for estimating forest Above Ground Biomass (AGB). However, there are mentions of certain data sources that could potentially be part of such a dataset. These include:

1. Lidar Data: As mentioned in the title of one of the cited works ("Lidar and machine learning estimation of hardwood forest biomass..."), Lidar data appears to play a significant role in this research field. Lidar technology uses light pulses to measure distances and can provide detailed information about vegetation structures.

2. Landsat Imagery: Another source of data mentioned is Landsat imagery. One of the cited papers specifically discusses "Comparison of machine-learning methods for above-ground biomass estimation based on Landsat imagery." Landsat satellites capture images of Earth's surface, which can then be analyzed to extract various environmental parameters.

3. Combined LiDAR and Landsat 8 Data: There is also mention of using both LiDAR and Landsat 8 data together for estimating forest AGB. This suggests that the researchers may have created their own composite dataset combining these two data sources.

However, without more explicit details regarding the exact nature of the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, it is difficult to definitively state whether they correspond to well-known benchmark datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
