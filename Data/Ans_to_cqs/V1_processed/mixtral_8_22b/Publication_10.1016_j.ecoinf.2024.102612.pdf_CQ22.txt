The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including Overall Accuracy, Intersection over Union (IoU), Mean Accuracy (MA), and Mean Intersection over Union (MIoU). These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance. Specifically, MA and MIoU take into account the individual values for each class within the dataset and compute their average, enhancing the reliability of the classification results for imbalanced data. The highest MIoU value is used to determine the point at which the Deep Neural Network (DNN) achieves optimal performance. Additionally, during the training process, metrics such as MIoU or MA are computed after each epoch to analyze the training performance.
