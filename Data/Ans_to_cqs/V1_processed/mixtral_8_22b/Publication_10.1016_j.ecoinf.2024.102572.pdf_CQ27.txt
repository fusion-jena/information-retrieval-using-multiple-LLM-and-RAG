Unfortunately, there isn't enough context provided to accurately determine what specific process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, generally speaking, after training a deep learning model, the next steps often involve saving or serializing the model so it can be reused without retraining, selecting a suitable deployment platform based on requirements such as scalability, latency, cost, etc., and then integrating the serialized model into the chosen platform.
