The article does not provide information about the specific code repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in this study. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact link to GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. However, the authors mention using TensorFlow, which is an open-source library for machine learning developed by Google Brain Team. The official website of TensorFlow provides extensive documentation and examples, including tutorials on how to use TensorFlow for various applications such as image classification, natural language processing, and time series forecasting. Additionally, there are many other resources available online where users can find sample codes and implementations of deep learning models using TensorFlow. It would be best to refer to these resources if one wants to learn more about implementing deep learning pipelines using TensorFlow.
