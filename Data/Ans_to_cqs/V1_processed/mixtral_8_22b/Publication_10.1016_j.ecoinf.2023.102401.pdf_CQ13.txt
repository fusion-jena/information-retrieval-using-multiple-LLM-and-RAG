Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of the specific hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model. However, Table 2 does present the hyperparameters used for data augmentation, specifying the ranges and probabilities for each augmentation technique. These include rotation range, width shift range, height shift range, shear range, zoom range, horizontal flip, vertical flip, and fill mode. For example, the rotation range is set between -10 and 10 degrees with a probability of 0.5, indicating that half of the images will undergo random rotations within this range. Similarly, other parameters like width shift range, height shift range, etc., have their respective values mentioned in the table. Unfortunately, without additional context, it is not possible to provide further information about the learning rate, optimizer, or any other hyperparameters related to the training of the deep learning model.
