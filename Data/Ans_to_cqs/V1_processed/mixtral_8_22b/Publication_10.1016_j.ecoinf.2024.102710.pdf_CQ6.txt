The preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model may vary depending on the specific application and dataset. However, some common preprocessing techniques include:

* Normalization: This involves rescaling the values of the input features so they fall within a certain range, typically between 0 and 1. This helps prevent any particular feature from dominating the others during training.
* Scaling: Similar to normalization, this technique involves adjusting the scale of the input features so they have similar magnitudes. This can help improve convergence during training.
* Cleaning: This step involves removing noise or irrelevant information from the dataset. For example, missing values might need to be imputed or outliers removed.
* Augmentation: Data augmentation techniques involve creating new examples by applying transformations to existing ones. This can help increase the diversity of the training data and reduce overfitting.

For audio data specifically, additional preprocessing steps may include converting raw audio files into spectrograms or mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), which can then be fed into the deep learning model. The exact preprocessing steps will depend on the specific requirements of the task and the chosen architecture.
