The given context does not provide specific information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model mentioned in the report. However, common practices used to improve the generalization performance of a deep learning model include using diverse datasets, cross-validation, stratified splitting, or a combination of these methods. Cross-validation is often employed to evaluate the model's ability to predict new data by dividing the available data into training and validation sets. Stratified splitting ensures that each class is represented proportionally in both the training and validation sets. Using a diverse dataset can help prevent overfitting and increase the robustness of the model when applied to unseen data. Without further details regarding the specific implementation of this deep learning model, it cannot be determined which of these techniques was utilized.
