In the given context, the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is audio, specifically bird songs or calls. These sounds are converted into spectrograms, which are visual representations of the spectrum of frequencies of sound as they vary with time. Spectrograms are essentially images, so one could argue that both audio and image data formats are utilized in this pipeline. There is no mention of using other data formats such as video, CSV, or others.
