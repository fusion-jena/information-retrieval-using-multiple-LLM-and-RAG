The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics such as accuracy, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into how well the model performs in terms of correctly identifying positive instances, false positives, and false negatives. For instance, in this study, the accuracy, recall, and F1-score are used to measure the performance of the proposed model. The accuracy metric indicates the proportion of correct predictions made out of total predictions. On the other hand, recall measures the true positive rate or sensitivity, i.e., the number of relevant instances retrieved divided by the total number of relevant instances. Lastly, the F1-score combines both precision and recall to give a balanced view of the model's performance. It is calculated as the harmonic mean of precision and recall.
