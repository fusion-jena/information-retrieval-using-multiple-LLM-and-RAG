Based on the given context, there isn't enough information to determine the exact purpose of the deep learning model being used. However, we can infer that the deep learning model might be used for tasks like classification, segmentation, or object detection based on its application in processing remote sensing data. In this case, the deep learning model could potentially aid in identifying various environmental features or patterns relevant to ecological studies. This could involve classifying different types of land cover, detecting changes over time, or segmenting images into distinct regions for further analysis. Nonetheless, without more specific details about the project or research goals, it remains uncertain what the precise role of the deep learning model would be.
