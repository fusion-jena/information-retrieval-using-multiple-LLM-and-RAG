Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available from the given context to determine what specific type of deep learning model is being used in the pipeline. None of the cited papers explicitly mention using a particular deep learning architecture like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. Therefore, without additional details about the pipeline, we cannot provide a definitive answer regarding which deep learning model is employed.
