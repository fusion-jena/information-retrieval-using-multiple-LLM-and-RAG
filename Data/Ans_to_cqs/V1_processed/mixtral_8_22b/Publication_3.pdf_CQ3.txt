Unfortunately, there isn't any information about specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline within the provided context. However, it does mention that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were employed for image classification tasks and pattern recognition. This implies that some form of image labeling or categorization was likely involved during the model training process. Nevertheless, without explicit details regarding the use of bounding box annotations, instance segmentations, or other similar techniques, I cannot provide a definitive response based solely on the given context.
