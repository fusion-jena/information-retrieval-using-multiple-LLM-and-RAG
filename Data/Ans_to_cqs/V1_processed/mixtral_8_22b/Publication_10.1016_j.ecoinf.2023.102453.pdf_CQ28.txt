Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of a specific platform like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform being used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of TensorFlow Lite format for converting the model for deployment on an edge device like Raspberry Pi (RPi). Therefore, it seems that the focus here is more on deploying the model on local edge devices rather than on a cloud platform.
