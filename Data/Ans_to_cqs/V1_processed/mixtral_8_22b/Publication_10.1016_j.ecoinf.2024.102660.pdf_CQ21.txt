After the model training, there are several postprocessing steps mentioned in the given context. These include testing the performance of the trained network using 356 image pairs, which can involve calculating evaluation metrics such as Accuracy (A), Precision (P), Recall (R), F1-score (F1), and Intersection over Union (IOU). However, the context does not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps like creating saliency maps or confusion matrices. Therefore, based on the information provided, it cannot be confirmed if these particular postprocessing techniques were utilized.
