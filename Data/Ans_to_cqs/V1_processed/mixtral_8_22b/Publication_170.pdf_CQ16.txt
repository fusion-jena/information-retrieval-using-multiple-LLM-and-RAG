The iteration termination condition of the model was the same in each round of training. Training would be completed when the loss rate of the model was less than a preset threshold of 1.0 Ã— 10^-4. This means that the training process would continue until the model's loss rate dropped below this threshold, indicating that the model had learned sufficiently from the training data.
