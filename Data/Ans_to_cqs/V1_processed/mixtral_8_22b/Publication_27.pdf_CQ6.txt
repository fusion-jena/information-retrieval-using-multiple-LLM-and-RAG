Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be applied to improve its performance and efficiency. These may include data cleaning, where missing or inconsistent values are handled appropriately; data transformation, such as normalization or standardization, which scales numerical input features to a similar range; encoding categorical variables into numerical form using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding; feature selection, where irrelevant or redundant features are removed to reduce dimensionality and noise; and splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test sets for model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning.
