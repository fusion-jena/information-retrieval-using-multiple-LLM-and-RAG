The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific dataset used in the proposed deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the authors use real-time data collected through IoT devices, which includes information about temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and nitrate concentration. These data points are then utilized to create a water contamination index, enabling the segregation of data into contaminated and non-contaminated classes. Therefore, there isn't a direct reference to commonly known datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet in this case.
