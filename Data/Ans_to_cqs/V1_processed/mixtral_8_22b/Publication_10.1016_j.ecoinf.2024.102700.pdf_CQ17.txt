The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that Maxent is a popular machine learning technique used in ecological modeling, which includes a "regularisation multiplier" to find a proper trade-off between flexibility and overfitting. This suggests that some form of regularization is being employed within the Maxent framework. Additionally, the context notes that there has been an increase in the use of machine learning techniques, including deep learning strategies such as neural networks. While the specific regularization methods used in these deep learning pipelines are not mentioned, common approaches to preventing overfitting in deep learning include dropout, L1 and L2 regularization, early stopping, and weight decay.
