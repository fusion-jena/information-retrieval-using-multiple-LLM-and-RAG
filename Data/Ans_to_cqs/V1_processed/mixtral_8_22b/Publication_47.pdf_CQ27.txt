The text does not provide explicit information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. However, it is mentioned that the authors developed an R package called 'IUCNN', which is based on the Python TensorFlow library, to predict the conservation status of unevaluated orchid species. This suggests that the trained model could be integrated within this R package for practical applications. Furthermore, the availability of the source code on GitHub implies that users can access and utilize the model through this repository. Nevertheless, specific details regarding the exact steps taken to deploy the trained model are not explicitly stated in the given context.
