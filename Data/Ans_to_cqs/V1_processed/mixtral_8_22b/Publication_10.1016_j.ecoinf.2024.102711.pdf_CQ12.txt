The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the AutoGluon pipeline. However, it does state that AutoGluon includes neural networks among its trained models. Neural networks can refer to various architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN), or transformers. Without further information, we cannot determine the exact type of deep learning model used in the AutoGluon pipeline.
