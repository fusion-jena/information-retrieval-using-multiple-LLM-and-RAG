The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does reference various machine learning models and techniques commonly used in landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM), which often rely on geospatial data. Some common sources of geospatial data include satellite imagery, LiDAR data, and other remotely sensed data. Additionally, ground truth data may be collected through field surveys or using sensor networks. Publicly available datasets, such as those provided by government agencies or research institutions, may also be used. In summary, while the exact methods for collecting raw data are not specified in the given context, some potential sources of data for use in a deep learning pipeline for LSM could include satellite imagery, LiDAR data, field surveys, sensor networks, and publicly available datasets.
