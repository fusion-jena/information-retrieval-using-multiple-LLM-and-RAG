The text does not provide explicit details on the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of deep learning for biodiversity monitoring and improving adaptive management of natural systems through analyzing large amounts of sensor data. In general, common techniques used to address data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. These methods aim to balance classes or ensure representation of all relevant categories within the dataset, which can improve model performance and mitigate potential biases.
