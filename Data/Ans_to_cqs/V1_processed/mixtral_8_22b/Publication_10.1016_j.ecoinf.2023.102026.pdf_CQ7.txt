The provided context does not directly address the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it mentions bootstrapping, a common technique used in machine learning for sampling with replacement from the original dataset to create new datasets for training or testing purposes. This method helps reduce bias and variance in the model. Other popular methods include holdout cross-validation, k-fold cross-validation, leave-one-out cross-validation, and stratified sampling. These methods aim to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data and avoids overfitting.
