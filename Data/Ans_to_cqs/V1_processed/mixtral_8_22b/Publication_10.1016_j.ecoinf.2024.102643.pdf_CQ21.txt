After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be taken to evaluate and interpret the results. These may include:

1. **Metrics Calculation**: This involves calculating various metrics such as Area Under Curve (AUC), True Skill Statistic (TSS), precision, recall, and F1 score to assess the performance and accuracy of the models. The text mentions that AUC and TSS were used for this purpose.

2. **Cross Validation**: Cross validation is often used to ensure the robustness of the model. It involves dividing the dataset into subsets and validating the model on different combinations of these subsets. The text mentions that cross-validation was done using bootstrapping.

3. **Confusion Matrix**: This is a table layout that allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm. Each row of the matrix represents the instances in a predicted class while each column represents the instances in an actual class.

However, it should be noted that the specific postprocessing steps can vary depending on the type of model and the problem being addressed. For instance, saliency maps might not always be relevant or necessary. They are typically used in deep learning models to understand which parts of the input had the most influence on the output. Since the context does not mention anything about deep learning or image data, it seems unlikely that saliency maps would have been used here.
