In this study, several data annotation techniques were employed for different tasks within their deep learning pipeline. For object detection, they utilized both bounding boxes and instance segmentation. Specifically, for each occurring animal in a frame of the training set, a polygonal segmentation mask was created to depict the visible silhouette, along with a corresponding bounding box and class label. These annotations were carried out using the VGG Image Annotator (VIA) version 2.0.8.

Moreover, the researchers evaluated two approaches to object detection via instance segmentation. They trained Mask R-CNN on video clips, presenting the video frames in their original temporal sequence within each clip. Subsequently, they compared this Mask R-CNN approach with the Flow-Guided Feature Aggregation (FGFA).

To summarize, the primary data annotation techniques used in this deep learning pipeline include bounding box annotation and instance segmentation. Both methods were applied to facilitate object detection tasks, with Mask R-CNN and FGFA being the chosen models for comparison.
