The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, based on general practices in machine learning and deep learning, it can be assumed that the researchers might have used either Graphical Processing Units (GPUs), Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), or both. These specialized processors are designed to handle large amounts of data and perform complex mathematical operations efficiently, making them ideal for training deep learning models. Nevertheless, without explicit information about the hardware resources used, this remains an assumption.
