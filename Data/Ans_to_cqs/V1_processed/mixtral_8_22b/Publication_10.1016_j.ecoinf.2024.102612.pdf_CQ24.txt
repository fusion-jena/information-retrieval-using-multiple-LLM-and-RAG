Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention or discussion about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some common strategies to address randomness in deep learning pipelines include:

1. Fixing the random seed: By setting a fixed random seed value, one can ensure reproducibility in their experiments. This means that every time the code runs, it will produce the same results, which makes debugging and comparing different approaches easier.

2. Using multiple seeds: To avoid overfitting to a specific random initialization, researchers often train their models with several different random seeds and report average performance metrics. This helps to provide a better estimate of the true performance of the model.

3. Stratified sampling: When dealing with imbalanced datasets, stratified sampling can be used to maintain the original distribution of classes during training and validation splits. This ensures that each subset has roughly the same proportion of examples from each class, reducing bias in the evaluation process.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, common methods include fixing the random seed, using multiple seeds, and employing stratified sampling techniques.
