The text does not provide explicit information regarding the use of specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is common practice in deep learning models to employ these techniques to improve generalization performance and avoid overfitting. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent complex co-adaptations on training data. On the other hand, L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function based on the sum of squares of weights, encouraging smaller weight values and reducing model complexity. Other popular regularization methods include early stopping, data augmentation, and batch normalization. While the given context does not mention any of these methods explicitly, they could still be employed within the described deep learning pipeline to address potential overfitting issues.
