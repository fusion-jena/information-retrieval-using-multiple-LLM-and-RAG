Based on the given context, there is no information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model such as learning rate or optimizer. The context only provides details about the input data layers for the model, including the Fire Weather Index (FWI) and Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC), both having a spatial resolution of 1 x 1 km. Additionally, it mentions the use of a nine-cell approach to improve prediction results by smoothing out data inaccuracies within individual grid cells. However, without further context regarding the deep learning model itself, we cannot determine the exact hyperparameters employed.
