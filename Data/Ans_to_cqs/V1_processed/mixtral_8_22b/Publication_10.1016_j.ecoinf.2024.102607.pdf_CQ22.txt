The study uses several metrics to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. These include Producer Accuracy (PA), User Accuracy (UA), Overall Accuracy (OA), and Kappa (%). Additionally, the confusion matrix is also presented, which shows the number of correctly classified pixels for each class. The value in the middle of the confusion matrix represents the total number of pixels. It should be noted that these metrics are commonly used in remote sensing and image processing tasks to assess the quality of the classification results.
