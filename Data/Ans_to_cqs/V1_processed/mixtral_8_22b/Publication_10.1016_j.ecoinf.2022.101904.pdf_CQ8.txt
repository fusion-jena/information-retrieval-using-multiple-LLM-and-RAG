The paper does not provide information on where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions the use of various deep learning methods such as Vision Transformer (ViT), Swin Transformer, CoAtNet, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Swin Transformer, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with Swin Transformer, and 3D UNet Generative Adversarial Network Swin Transformer (3DUNetGSFormer) for wetland mapping. However, it does not mention any specific code repositories or links to them. Therefore, I do not know where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
