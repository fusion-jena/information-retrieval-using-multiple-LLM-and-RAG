The performance of the deep learning model was evaluated using several metrics. These include the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), which measures the quality of ranking results, and was also used in the BirdCLEF2018 competition. Additionally, accuracy (ACC) was used to calculate the proportion of correctly classified items. An average accuracy across all class hierarchies (avg_ACC) was computed to evaluate the effectiveness of the hierarchical classification. Furthermore, the Hierarchical Distance of a Mistake (HDM) was utilized to measure the severity of misclassifications when only one class could be predicted. This metric takes into account the taxonomic hierarchy between classes, meaning that misclassifying a species within the same genus might result in a lower penalty compared to misclassifying it as a completely different family or order.
