The text does not explicitly state how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, it mentions that the model parameters were tuned on an independent dataset, which suggests some form of parameter tuning or optimization was performed. This could have been done through methods such as grid search or random search, where different combinations of hyperparameter values are tested to find the best performing set. It's important to note that the specific method used for hyperparameter optimization is not mentioned in the given context.
