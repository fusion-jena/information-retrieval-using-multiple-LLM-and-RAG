The given context does not provide specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it mentions that image presegmentation was used in the proposed method, which could potentially involve some form of semantic segmentation or instance segmentation. Additionally, the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and deep neural networks (DNN) suggests that these models might require labeled data for training, but the exact type of labeling technique is not specified. Therefore, without additional context, it cannot be determined what specific data annotation techniques were used in this case.
