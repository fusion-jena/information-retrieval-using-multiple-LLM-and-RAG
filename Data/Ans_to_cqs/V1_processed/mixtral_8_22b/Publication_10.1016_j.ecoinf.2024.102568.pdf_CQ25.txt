The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is not explicitly stated; however, it can be inferred that the model is used for prediction or forecasting tasks related to air quality (AQ) monitoring. Specifically, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model is employed to predict the concentration of pollutants in the atmosphere based on historical data collected from legal AQ stations located within the city of Modena, Italy. This information is crucial for understanding and managing air pollution levels in urban areas.

The LSTM model is chosen because it is well-suited for handling sequential data, which makes it ideal for analyzing time-series data like those generated by AQ monitoring systems. Additionally, the use of Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function indicates that the goal of the model is to minimize the difference between predicted and actual concentrations of pollutants. Furthermore, the inclusion of a dropout layer helps prevent overfitting during the training process, ensuring that the model generalizes well to unseen data.

Overall, the primary objective of implementing this deep learning model appears to be improving the accuracy and reliability of air quality predictions, ultimately contributing to more effective environmental management strategies.
