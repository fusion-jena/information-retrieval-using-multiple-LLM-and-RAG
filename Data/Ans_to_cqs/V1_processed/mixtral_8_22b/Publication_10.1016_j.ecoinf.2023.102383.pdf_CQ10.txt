The article does not provide information about the specific code repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in this study. Therefore, I cannot provide the exact link to the source code or any related repositories. However, if you are interested in exploring similar implementations or other projects involving Faster R-CNN, ResNet, and Feature Pyramid Networks (FPNs), there are several open-source resources available online.

For instance, here are some relevant links to GitHub repositories containing implementations of these methods:

1. [Faster R-CNN](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark): This repository contains an implementation of Faster R-CNN and Mask R-CNN built upon Detectron2. It also includes pretrained weights for popular backbone architectures like ResNet and ResNeXt.

2. [Feature Pyramid Networks (FPNs)](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/vision/image_classification#fpn): TensorFlow provides an official implementation of FPNs within their image classification module. You can find more information and examples in their documentation.

3. [ResNet](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/main/torchvision/models/resnet.py): PyTorch offers an implementation of ResNet in their torchvision package. They have multiple versions of ResNet available, ranging from ResNet18 to ResNet152.
