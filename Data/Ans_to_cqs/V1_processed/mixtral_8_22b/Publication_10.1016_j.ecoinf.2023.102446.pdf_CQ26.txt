Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it can be inferred that the authors have taken certain measures to ensure the quality and reliability of their dataset. For instance, they have collected data over a significant time frame using various sensors measuring different environmental factors. They have also mentioned the use of lagged information (Ï„ = 1 to 12, i.e., 6 h) which suggests that they have considered historical data points while analyzing the current ones. Furthermore, they have acknowledged the limitation of their study due to unavailability of post-2016 flux tower data. Despite these efforts, without explicit mention of techniques used to handle data bias, it cannot be definitively stated what methods were employed by the authors.
