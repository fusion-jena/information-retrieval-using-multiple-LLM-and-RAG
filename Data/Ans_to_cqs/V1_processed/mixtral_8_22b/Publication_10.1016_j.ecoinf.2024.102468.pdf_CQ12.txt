The text does not provide explicit information about the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it mentions that the proposed method is called WT-HMM, which suggests that it might be based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM). Furthermore, there is no mention of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers in the given context. Therefore, without additional information, we cannot determine the exact type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
