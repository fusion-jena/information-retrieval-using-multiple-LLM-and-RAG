Data augmentation techniques are used to artificially increase the number of samples in the training set by applying specific deformations on the input images. This allows building a larger dataset of transformed images that are still meaningful for the case study. Some examples of these transformations include rotation, flipping, translation, cropping, or changing the brightness of the pixels. These techniques help improve the performance of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models and make them more robust to changes in scales, brightness, and geometric distortions. The effectiveness of these techniques depends on the specific problem being addressed.
