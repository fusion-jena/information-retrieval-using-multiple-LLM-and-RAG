Unfortunately, the given context does not provide explicit information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. However, it mentions that hyperparameter tuning was performed via GridSearchCV with cross-validation (cv = 10) for all predictive models, including those based on deep learning algorithms. Common hyperparameters in deep learning models include learning rate, batch size, epochs, optimizer type, and others depending on the architecture of the neural network. It can be inferred from the context that the 'learning_rate' was one of the hyperparameters tuned for the boosting models, but it doesn't explicitly state if it was also applied to the deep learning models. Therefore, the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model cannot be determined solely based on the provided context.
