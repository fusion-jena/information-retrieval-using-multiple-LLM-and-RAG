The study uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as its deep learning model. Specifically, it employs the ResNet 100 architecture, which was introduced by He et al. in 2016. CNNs are particularly well-suited for tasks involving visual data, making them ideal for analyzing underwater imagery. They can simultaneously extract features from images and classify these images using the extracted features. In this case, the researchers utilized ResNet 100 to create an image classification model, feeding it large datasets consisting of labeled images. Through a process known as back-propagation, the model adjusts its internal parameters to reduce classification errors. Notably, ResNet 100 has demonstrated exceptional performance in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Competition (ILSVRC), further supporting its suitability for this application.
