Unfortunately, there is no information available regarding the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model mentioned in the given context. The context only discusses the use of two common variable elimination techniques for random forests - Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Variable Selection Using Random Forests (VSURF), but does not provide any details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model itself. Therefore, it is not possible to determine what hyperparameters were used in the deep learning model from the given context alone.
