The text does not explicitly mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does discuss some aspects related to the training process and data preparation. For instance, the text mentions that a pre-trained CMGAN model was fine-tuned using a maximum of 1000 five-second noisy and clean samples. Additionally, the data was downsampled to 16 kHz to align with the model's input requirements. While these details do not directly address the query about ensuring generalizability, they suggest that the authors considered certain aspects of data preparation and model adaptation during their study.
