The information regarding the availability and location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline mentioned by M.S. Sarkar et al. in their Ecological Informatics article is not explicitly stated within the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer on where the code repository can be found. It would be best to refer directly to the original research paper or contact the authors for this specific information.
