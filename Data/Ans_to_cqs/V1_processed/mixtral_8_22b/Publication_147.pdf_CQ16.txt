Based on the given information, it appears that the CNN model was trained using a geometrically decaying learning rate for 110 epochs, with each epoch consisting of 4800 training samples. However, the specific criteria used to determine when training should be stopped, such as reaching a validation loss plateau, are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer based solely on this information.
