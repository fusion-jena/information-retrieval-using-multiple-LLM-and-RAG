Strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline include setting a fixed random seed value, performing multiple runs of the experiment, and averaging results across those runs. Setting a fixed random seed value ensures reproducibility of results, while running multiple trials helps account for variability introduced by random factors like weight initialization in neural networks or random sampling during training. By averaging results across multiple runs, we can obtain a more robust estimate of model performance. In this case, the WT-HMM was evaluated over 10 runs with varying dataset sizes to capture the impact of randomness on its performance.
