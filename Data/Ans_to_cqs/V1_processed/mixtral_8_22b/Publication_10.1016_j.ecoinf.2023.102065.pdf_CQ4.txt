In the given dataset, the data augmentation technique applied in the deep learning pipeline involves splitting the merged.wav training file for each species in half and then adding these two halves sample-wise. This results in an augmented.wav file, which is further processed by slicing it into 2-second increments and computing mel-spectrograms. However, the specific techniques mentioned in the query like flipping, rotating, or scaling do not appear to be explicitly stated in the provided context.
