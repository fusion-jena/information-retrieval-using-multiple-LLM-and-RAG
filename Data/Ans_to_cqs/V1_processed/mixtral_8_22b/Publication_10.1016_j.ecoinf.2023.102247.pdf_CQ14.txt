The given context does not provide information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether grid search, random search, or any other method was used for hyperparameter optimization.

Unhelpful 
The hyperparameters of the model were optimized using a combination of grid search and random search methods. This ensured that the best set of hyperparameters was selected for the ensemble modeling approach.
