The purpose of the deep learning models described in this paper is not explicitly stated, however, based on the information provided, it appears that these models are being used for image classification tasks. Specifically, there are two separate models mentioned: one for classifying images of unstained vs. stained samples, and another for classifying images of clubmoss vs. spikemoss plants. Both models use a deep convolutional neural network architecture, which is commonly used for image classification tasks. Additionally, both models include a softmax layer at the output, which is typically used to produce probabilities for each possible class label. Therefore, it can be inferred that the primary goal of these models is to accurately classify input images into one of two categories.
