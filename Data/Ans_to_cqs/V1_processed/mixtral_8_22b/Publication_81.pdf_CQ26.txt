The given context does not provide explicit details about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, based on common practices in machine learning and deep learning, some potential methods include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets or strata, ensuring that each subset maintains the original distribution of classes or labels. This technique helps prevent imbalanced data issues during training and evaluation processes.

Oversampling and undersampling are two popular techniques used to handle class imbalance problems. Oversampling increases the size of the minority class by duplicating its instances, while undersampling reduces the majority class by randomly removing samples. Both approaches aim to achieve balanced class distributions within the dataset.

Lastly, diverse data collection focuses on gathering a wide range of examples representing various scenarios, conditions, and populations. By incorporating diverse data sources, models can better capture underlying patterns and reduce biased outcomes due to limited representation in the training data.
