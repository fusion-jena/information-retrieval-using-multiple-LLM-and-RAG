Unfortunately, the given context does not provide any explicit details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the optimizer. It primarily focuses on describing the overall process of generating training data for the Phenological Cycle Feature (PCF) using satellite images and the application of the U-Net model for land cover classification. To find out more about the specific hyperparameters used in this study, it would be necessary to refer to the original source material or contact the authors directly.
