The performance of the deep learning model was evaluated using precision and recall statistics. These were calculated based on the intersection-over-union (IoU), which measures the degree of overlap between the predicted tree crowns and the manually annotated ones. Each bounding box prediction came with a confidence score between 0 and 1. A threshold was set to determine which predictions to accept, balancing the trade-off between capturing more trees and maintaining high precision. The average precision (AP) metric was also used, which is the area under the precision-recall curve computed at fixed intervals from 0 to 1. This allowed for a single metric to compare different generalization approaches.
