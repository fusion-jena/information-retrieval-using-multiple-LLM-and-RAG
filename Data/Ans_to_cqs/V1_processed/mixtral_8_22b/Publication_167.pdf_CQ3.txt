The given context does not provide information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and labeling. These techniques help in creating labeled datasets required for supervised machine learning tasks such as object detection, image classification, and semantic segmentation. Without explicit mention in the provided context, we cannot determine which specific technique was employed in their deep learning pipeline.
