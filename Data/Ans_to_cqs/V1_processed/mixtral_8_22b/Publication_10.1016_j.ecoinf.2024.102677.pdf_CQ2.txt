The given context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline for landscape classification. However, it can be inferred that the authors use images as input data since they discuss applying deep learning techniques to classify different types of landscapes. Specifically, they employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are commonly used for image analysis tasks such as object detection and image segmentation. Therefore, it can be assumed that the input data consists of images or image datasets.

Additionally, the paper mentions various preprocessing steps applied to the input data before feeding them into the deep learning models. These include normalization, augmentation, and patch generation. Normalization scales pixel values between 0 and 1, while augmentation involves creating new training samples by applying transformations like rotation, scaling, and flipping. Patch generation refers to dividing large images into smaller patches to reduce computational complexity during training. All these preprocessing steps further suggest that the input data comprises images rather than other formats like audio or video files.

Furthermore, some references cited in the text provide additional evidence supporting this assumption. For instance, Bayr and Puschmann (2019) describe automatic detection of woody vegetation in repeat landscape photographs using a CNN, indicating that their input data also consisted of images. Similarly, Chen et al. (2021a) apply deep learning techniques to classify urban morphology based on satellite images. Overall, although the exact data format is not specified in the given context, it can be reasonably concluded that the input data used in the deep learning pipeline primarily consists of images.
