The given context does not provide information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or any specific strategies related to random seed values. However, some common strategies used to manage randomness in deep learning pipelines include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using ensemble methods like Bagging and Boosting, employing cross-validation techniques, and applying regularization methods to reduce overfitting. It should be noted that these strategies may not directly address the issue of managing randomness due to random seed values but can help improve overall model stability and generalizability.
