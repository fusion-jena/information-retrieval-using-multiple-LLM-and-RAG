Based on the provided context, it is not explicitly stated what specific data format is used in the deep learning pipeline. However, since the study focuses on comparing deep learning (Convolutional Neural Networks - CNN) and shallow learning (Extreme Gradient Boosting - XGB) methods for producing a large-scale spatial wetland classification, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is likely related to remote sensing imagery. This assumption is supported by the fact that the input variables mentioned in Table 1 include various bands from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and other similar remote sensing derived indices. Therefore, it can be concluded that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is primarily based on remote sensing imagery.
