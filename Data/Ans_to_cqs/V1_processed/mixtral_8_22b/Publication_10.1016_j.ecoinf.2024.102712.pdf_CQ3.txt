The given context does not explicitly mention any specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it discusses various types of data sources and their resolutions, including field data, spectral data, relative height data, and above ground biomass density data. These datasets could potentially be used in conjunction with deep learning models for tasks like object detection, semantic segmentation, or regression analysis. The context also mentions using these data in a model-assisted framework or hierarchical modeling, which may involve some form of data preprocessing or labeling before being fed into a deep learning pipeline. Nonetheless, without further information about the specific application or methodology employed, we cannot definitively state what data annotation techniques were utilized.
