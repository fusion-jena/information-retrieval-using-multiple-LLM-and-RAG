Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. However, commonly used evaluation metrics for such models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC). These metrics help assess the effectiveness of the model in making accurate predictions or classifications. Without further details regarding the specific deep learning model used in this study, I can only provide these general examples of evaluation metrics.
