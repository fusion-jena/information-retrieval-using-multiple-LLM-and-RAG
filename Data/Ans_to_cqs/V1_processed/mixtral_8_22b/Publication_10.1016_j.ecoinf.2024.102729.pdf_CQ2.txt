Based on the provided context, it does not explicitly mention what specific data format was used in the deep learning pipeline. However, considering the topic of the research papers mentioned, which revolves around water quality management, spatial and temporal variation in water coverage, urban flood susceptibility, and lake eutrophication, we can infer that the data formats used could be structured datasets like CSV files containing various parameters related to water quality, remote sensing images, or time series data. It would be best to refer to the original sources for more detailed information about the exact data formats used in their respective studies.
