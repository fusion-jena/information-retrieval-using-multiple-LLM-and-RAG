The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using early stopping. Early stopping is a form of regularization used to avoid overfitting by terminating the training process before it has the chance to fit the noise in the training data. In this case, the validation loss was monitored using early stopping during training time for every epoch on the validation set. A patience of 20 was chosen, meaning that if the validation loss did not improve after 20 consecutive epochs, the training would be stopped. Additionally, a batch size of 16 and a number of epochs of 500 were also specified for the training process.
