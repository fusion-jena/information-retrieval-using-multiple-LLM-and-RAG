Unfortunately, based on the given context, there isn't enough information to determine what specific data format is being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, considering that the goal is to reconstruct caesium-137 chronic particulate concentrations in rivers using Hierarchical Attention-Based Recurrent Highway Networks (HRHN), it can be assumed that the input data would likely consist of time series data containing measurements of caesium-137 levels in water samples collected from various locations along the river systems. These measurements could potentially be stored in a structured format like CSV files, with columns representing variables such as date/time, location, and caesium-137 concentration level. Additionally, since HRHNs are designed to handle sequential data, the input data should ideally be organized in a way that preserves the temporal order of the observations.
