The study utilizes passive acoustic recording equipment to collect raw data over long time periods and large spatial scales. The specific type or model of the recording equipment is not mentioned in the given context. However, it is clear that the collected data consists of audio files containing information about ecological communities and their habitats. These audio files serve as the primary source of data for further processing and analysis using deep learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

In summary, the method employed for collecting raw data in this deep learning pipeline involves the use of passive acoustic recording equipment to gather audio data over extended periods and vast areas.
