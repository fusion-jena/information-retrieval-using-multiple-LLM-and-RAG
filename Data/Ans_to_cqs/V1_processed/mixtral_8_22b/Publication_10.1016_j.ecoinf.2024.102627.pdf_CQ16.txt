The training process is completed based on the performance of the model on the validation set. Specifically, the training stops at the best epoch previously determined on the validation set. In this case, the best epoch was found to be epoch 69. After determining the best epoch, a new training is initiated from scratch using the entire dataset. The goal is to achieve the best possible model weights prior to conducting global-scale inference. Therefore, the criterion used to determine when training is complete is reaching the best epoch on the validation set.
