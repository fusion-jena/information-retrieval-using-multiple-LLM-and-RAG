Based on the given information, it appears that the authors utilized a deep learning model for their forecasting task; however, they did not explicitly mention the specific type of deep learning model employed, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. Nevertheless, from the table presenting the initial hyperparameters space, we can infer that the authors likely used a feedforward neural network, also known as a multilayer perceptron (MLP), due to the presence of dense layers and dropout layers. Dense layers are fully connected layers where each input node connects to every output node, making them suitable for various tasks like regression and classification. Dropout layers help prevent overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of input units to zero during training. Therefore, although the exact type of deep learning model remains unspecified, the use of dense and dropout layers suggests that the authors might have implemented a form of MLP for their forecasting task.
