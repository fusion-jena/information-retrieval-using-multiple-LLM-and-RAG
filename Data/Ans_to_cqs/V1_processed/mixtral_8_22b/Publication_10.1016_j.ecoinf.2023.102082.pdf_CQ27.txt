The provided context does not explicitly state the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, including details such as model serialization or platform selection. However, it mentions that Lang10m, a high-resolution Canopy Height Model (CHM) of the Earth, was derived by fusing GEDI and Sentinel-2 images through a deep convolutional neural network (Lang et al., 2022). This implies that the deep learning model was likely developed and deployed using this methodology. Unfortunately, without further information, I cannot provide specific details about the deployment process, such as model serialization or platform selection.
