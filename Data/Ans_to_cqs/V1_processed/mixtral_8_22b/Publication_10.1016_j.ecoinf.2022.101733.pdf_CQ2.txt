In the given context, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned. However, based on the information provided, we can infer that the data format used is likely to be remote sensing (RS) images. This is because the context mentions various batches of data such as visible (red, green, and blue) bands of Sentinel-2 data, twelve MS bands of Sentinel-2 data, MS + spectral indices, MS + spectral features + Sentinel-1 bands, and MS + spectral features + textural features + Sentinel-1 bands + DSM. All of these refer to different types of remote sensing data. Additionally, the context also mentions using multi-source RS images and NDVI time-series analysis in Google Earth Engine (GEE) for crop type mapping. Therefore, it can be concluded that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is most likely to be remote sensing images.
