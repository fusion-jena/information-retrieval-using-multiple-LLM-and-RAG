The information provided does not explicitly state what specific data format is used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of underwater spectral images for dense taxonomic mapping of benthic habitats, which suggests that the deep learning pipeline may involve image data. Additionally, there is mention of automatic underwater fish species classification, further indicating the potential use of image data in the deep learning process. It should also be noted that the glossary includes various metrics related to density, richness, biomass, height, footprint, surface area, surface index, and volume occupied, suggesting that the data could include numerical values or measurements. Without more explicit details about the deep learning pipeline, it cannot be definitively stated what exact data formats are being used.
