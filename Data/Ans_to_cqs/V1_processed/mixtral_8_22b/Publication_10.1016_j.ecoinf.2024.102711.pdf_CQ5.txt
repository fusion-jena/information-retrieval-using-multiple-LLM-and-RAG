The provided context does not mention any specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it discusses using a limited dataset consisting of 113 data records for modeling fire behavior. Additionally, synthetic data generation is mentioned as a way to enhance real-world datasets.

Based on the given information, we cannot provide the exact datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. It appears that the authors have utilized a custom dataset related to their research topic, i.e., modeling fire behavior, along with potentially employing synthetic data generation methods.
