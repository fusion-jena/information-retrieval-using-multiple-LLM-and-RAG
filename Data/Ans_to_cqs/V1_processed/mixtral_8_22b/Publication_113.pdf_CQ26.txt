The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it discusses several aspects related to improving the performance of deep learning models through active learning and dimensionality reduction.

In the context of addressing data bias, one could consider employing stratified splitting, where the data is divided into subsets based on class labels, ensuring each subset maintains the same distribution of classes as the original dataset. This technique helps prevent imbalanced classes during training and evaluation.

Oversampling involves duplicating examples from underrepresented classes to balance the dataset, while undersampling removes instances from overrepresented classes. Both techniques aim to mitigate class imbalance issues.

Collecting diverse data is another approach to reducing data bias. By gathering data from multiple sources, demographics, or environments, the resulting dataset will better represent real-world scenarios and minimize biases introduced by limited data diversity.

While these techniques are not directly mentioned in the given context, they remain relevant when considering ways to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
