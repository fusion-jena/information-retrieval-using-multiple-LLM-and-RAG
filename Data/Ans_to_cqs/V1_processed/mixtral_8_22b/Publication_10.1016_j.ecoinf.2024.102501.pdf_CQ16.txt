Based on the given information, there isn't a direct mention of specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, common practices include monitoring metrics such as validation loss or accuracy during training and stopping when they reach a plateau or no longer improve significantly. This approach helps prevent overfitting and ensures optimal performance on unseen data. In this case, the authors use a separate dataset for validation, which suggests they might have employed similar techniques to decide when to stop training their models.
