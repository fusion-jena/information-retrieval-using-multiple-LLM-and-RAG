Based on the given context, there is no direct mention of specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some general approaches can be inferred based on common practices in machine learning and data science. These include stratified splitting, which ensures that each subset of the dataset maintains the same class proportions as the original dataset. Oversampling and undersampling are also commonly used techniques to balance datasets by either duplicating minority classes or removing instances from majority classes, respectively. Additionally, diverse data collection can help mitigate biases by ensuring that the training data represents various scenarios and conditions. It should be noted that these techniques may not necessarily apply directly to deep learning pipelines but could still provide valuable guidance when addressing data bias issues.
