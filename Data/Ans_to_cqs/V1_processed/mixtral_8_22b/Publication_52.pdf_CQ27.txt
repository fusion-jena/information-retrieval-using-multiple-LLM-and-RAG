The text does not provide explicit information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, we can infer from the given context that the authors used Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs), which are known for requiring minimal training time compared to other engineering learning algorithms. They also mentioned using an innovative Deep Learning algorithm called DELE. Unfortunately, there is no specific mention of how these models were deployed or serialized, nor any details regarding platform selection. Therefore, without additional context, it would be speculative to describe the exact process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
