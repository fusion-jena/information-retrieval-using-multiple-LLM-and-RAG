The text does not provide explicit information regarding specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using diverse datasets or employing techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting. However, it mentions that the researchers used data from two separate natural environment surveys and implemented a correlation analysis of the variables before model implementation. This suggests that they aimed to improve the robustness and reliability of their findings by considering multiple sources of data and reducing potential biases. Additionally, the use of seven different machine learning models indicates an attempt to compare and validate the results across various methodologies. Nevertheless, without further details, it cannot be confirmed whether these steps directly address the issue of ensuring the generalizability of the deep learning model.
