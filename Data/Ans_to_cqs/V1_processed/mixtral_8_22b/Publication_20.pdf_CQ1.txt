In the given context, there is no explicit mention of the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information available, we can infer that underwater images were collected as part of the raw data. These images may have been obtained through various means such as cameras mounted on remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), or even divers equipped with cameras.

The paper mentions the use of a dataset containing 20 fish species, which suggests that the raw data collection involved capturing images of these species in their natural habitat. This could be achieved through dedicated surveys or expeditions aimed at documenting marine life. Additionally, the authors refer to the use of 'thumbnails,' indicating that the raw data might have been preprocessed to extract smaller image samples from larger images or videos.

While the exact methodology for collecting raw data remains unclear, it is evident that the study relied heavily on visual data in the form of underwater images. Further research into the cited papers or related literature would provide more detailed insights into the specific techniques employed for gathering raw data in this particular deep learning application.
