The given context does not provide information about which specific frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch were used to build the deep learning model. It mainly focuses on describing the VGG16 architecture, also known as OxfordNet, which was chosen for its performance on the ImageNet dataset. Additionally, it discusses the design of a custom CNN model with fewer layers compared to traditional VGG16 or VGG19 models. However, there is no mention of any particular deep learning framework utilized in building these models.
