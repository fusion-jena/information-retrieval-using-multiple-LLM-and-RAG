Based on the given context, there isn't enough information to provide a direct answer regarding the strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, we can infer some relevant details about the topic discussed in the text. The context primarily focuses on comparing different recording systems for detecting and monitoring songbirds using various methods such as coherence measures and power spectral densities. It also discusses the importance of considering factors like manufacturing conditions, wear, and device models when analyzing ecoacoustic data. Unfortunately, none of the sources mentioned in the context directly address strategies for monitoring model performance during training. Therefore, based on the available information, it is not possible to determine what specific strategy was implemented to monitor the model performance during training.
