The context does not provide explicit details about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of millions of labeled data from the SS project, which suggests that one possible source of raw data could be publicly available datasets like ImageNet or CIFAR-10. Additionally, the paper discusses the application of deep learning to automate information extraction from camera-trap images, indicating that another potential source of raw data might be sensor data collected from cameras deployed in natural environments. Furthermore, the context references several papers related to deep learning and computer vision, such as AlexNet, NiN, VGG, GoogLeNet, and ResNet, suggesting that these models may have been employed in processing the raw data obtained from various sources.
