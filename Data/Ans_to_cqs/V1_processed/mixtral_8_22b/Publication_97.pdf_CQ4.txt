The authors applied specific data augmentation techniques to address the issue of overfitting caused by different atmospheric conditions during image acquisition. They employed two main transformations: random changes to the RGB channels of the original images and random vertical and horizontal flips. These changes did not exceed 0.1 by absolute value and were applied simultaneously to all channels using the utility function 'apply\_channel\_shift' from the Keras package. Additionally, they considered using small random rotations but found that this did not improve the network's performance. With a batch size of 20 and up to 1500 epochs for training, nearly 30,000 different augmented images of size 256 x 256 were utilized.
