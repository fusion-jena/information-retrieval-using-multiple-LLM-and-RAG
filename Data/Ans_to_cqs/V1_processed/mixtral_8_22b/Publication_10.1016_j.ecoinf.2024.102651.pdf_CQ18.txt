Based on the given information, it appears there isn't a direct mention of the specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, we can infer from the data provided that the authors have evaluated their proposed model against other models such as ResNet50 and ViT using a dataset containing objects of different sizes ("medium" and "small"). They have reported the classification accuracy achieved by these models in Table 3. From this table, we can see that the proposed model outperforms both ResNet50 and ViT in terms of classification accuracy for both medium and small objects. Furthermore, they mentioned that the use of Class Activation Mapping (CAM) has helped improve the classification accuracy by enabling the network to focus on important regions within the input images. Therefore, while the exact monitoring strategy is not explicitly stated, it seems that the authors have relied on evaluating the classification accuracy of their model against benchmark models like ResNet50 and ViT to assess its performance during training.
