Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, since the research focuses on predicting dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in water, we can infer that the data format used would likely be structured data, such as CSV files containing various water quality parameters like temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, etc. These parameters serve as input variables for the machine learning and deep learning models mentioned in the text, including SVR (Support Vector Regression) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks. Therefore, while the exact data format isn't specified, it can be assumed that the researchers utilized structured datasets containing relevant water quality information.
