The study examines the use of several data augmentation techniques in their deep learning pipeline. These techniques include adding Gaussian noise, creating sea wave distortions, and applying blur effects. Specifically, they added Gaussian noise within the range of 0 to 255*0.2 to generate lower resolution images. They created sea wave distortions using alpha=50 and sigma=9 to simulate the appearance of sea waves. Lastly, they applied blur effects within the range of 0.75 to 1.5 to mimic the appearance of unclear images. However, it should be noted that the authors found that preprocessing the input was preferred over using data augmentation due to its superior performance. Despite this finding, they continued to explore the potential benefits of combining both approaches.
