The text does not provide explicit information on the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, based on common practices in machine learning, some possible strategies include tracking metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or loss function values during training epochs. Additionally, techniques like cross-validation or early stopping might be employed to prevent overfitting and ensure optimal model performance.
