Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. However, it does indicate that a hyperparameter tuning technique was employed along with a batch updated stochastic gradient descent method [1]. This suggests that the learning rate might have been one of the adjusted parameters since it plays a crucial role in stochastic gradient descent optimization. Additionally, the use of dimensionality reduction techniques like ESPCA implies that some form of regularization could have been applied to prevent overfitting [2]. Nevertheless, without more detailed information about the model configuration, we cannot provide a definitive list of all the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
