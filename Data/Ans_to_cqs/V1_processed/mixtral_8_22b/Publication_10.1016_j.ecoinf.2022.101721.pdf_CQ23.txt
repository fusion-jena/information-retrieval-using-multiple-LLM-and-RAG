The paper titled "Development and Test of a Bat Calls Detection and Classification Method Based on Convolutional Neural Networks" discusses the development of a deep learning model for detecting and classifying bat echolocation calls using convolutional neural networks (CNN). However, it does not explicitly mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.

Nevertheless, some clues about potential methods used to enhance the model's generalization capabilities can be found within the text. For instance, the authors state that they included all observations in the statistical modeling instead of excluding them, which could have affected the reliability of the study. Including more diverse datasets is known to help improve the robustness and generalizability of machine learning models.

Additionally, the use of CNNs inherently provides some level of generalization due to its ability to learn hierarchical representations from raw input data. The authors also suggest implementing Bayesian algorithms, which allow users to interact with the software, potentially improving its performance. While this may not directly address generalizability, it indicates an interest in developing a flexible and adaptable system.

However, without explicit information regarding techniques such as cross-validation or stratified sampling, it cannot be definitively stated what specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. Further research into the methodology employed would provide a clearer understanding of how the authors approached this aspect of model development.
