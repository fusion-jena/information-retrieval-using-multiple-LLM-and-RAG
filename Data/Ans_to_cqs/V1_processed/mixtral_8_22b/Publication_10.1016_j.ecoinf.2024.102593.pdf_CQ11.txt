The given context does not provide any direct reference to the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the mentioned models and their sources, I can infer that the VGGish model was implemented using TensorFlow Hub, which provides various pretrained models including those for audio analysis. Unfortunately, there isn't enough information to determine if this specific implementation is hosted on a public repository like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Similarly, the BirdNET model is referenced but no explicit link to its source code or data repository is provided. Therefore, without additional context, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the data repository links for these deep learning pipelines.
