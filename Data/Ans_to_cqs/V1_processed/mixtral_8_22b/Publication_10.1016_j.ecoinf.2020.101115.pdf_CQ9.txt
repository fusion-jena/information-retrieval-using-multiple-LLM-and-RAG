Based on the given information, it appears that the data repository mentioned is called the Data Catalogue, which is operated through Drupal, an open-source, web-based content management system. However, there is no specific mention of where this repository is publicly accessible or if it has been published on platforms such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
