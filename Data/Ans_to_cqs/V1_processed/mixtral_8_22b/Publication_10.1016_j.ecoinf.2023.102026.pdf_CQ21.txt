The article does not provide explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, based on general machine learning practices, some common postprocessing steps include evaluating the performance of the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score, creating confusion matrices to visualize the performance of the classifier, generating saliency maps to understand the importance of each feature in predicting the target variable, and fine-tuning hyperparameters to improve the model's performance. These steps can help ensure that the model is robust and reliable before it is deployed for real-world applications.
