Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some common strategies used to manage randomness include:

1. Fixed Random Seeds: One way to ensure reproducibility in experiments involving random processes like shuffling datasets or initializing weights is by fixing the random seed. By doing so, the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers will be generated each time the code runs, ensuring consistent results across multiple executions.

2. Multiple Runs: To account for variability due to random initialization or stochastic optimization techniques, researchers may conduct several runs of their models with different seeds and report average performance metrics along with standard deviation or confidence intervals.

3. Cross-Validation: Another strategy to mitigate the impact of randomness is employing cross-validation techniques. These involve splitting the dataset into multiple folds and iteratively training and evaluating the model on different subsets of the data. This helps reduce bias and variance introduced by specific train/test splits.

4. Deterministic Algorithms: Some operations within deep learning pipelines can also introduce non-determinism, such as parallel processing or GPU computations. Using deterministic versions of these algorithms or libraries can help maintain consistency between runs.
