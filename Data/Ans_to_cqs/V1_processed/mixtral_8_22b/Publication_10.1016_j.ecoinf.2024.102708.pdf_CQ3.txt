The paper does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the context that the authors use object detection models, namely YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN (FR-CNN), for detecting Pacific oysters in drone images. Object detection involves localizing and classifying objects within an image, typically using bounding boxes or instance segmentation masks. Given this information, it is likely that the authors employed either bounding box annotation or instance segmentation during the data annotation process.

Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangular boxes around each object of interest in an image, along with labeling the corresponding class. This technique is commonly used for object detection tasks, such as those performed by YOLOv5 and FR-CNN. Instance segmentation, on the other hand, involves creating pixel-level masks for individual instances of objects within an image. While more time-consuming and complex than bounding box annotation, instance segmentation provides more precise object boundaries and can better handle overlapping objects.

Without explicit confirmation from the paper, it remains uncertain whether the authors utilized bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, or both for their data annotation needs. Nonetheless, given the nature of the task and the chosen models, it is reasonable to assume that one or both of these techniques were employed.
