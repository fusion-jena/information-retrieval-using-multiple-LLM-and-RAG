Based on the given context, it appears that the researchers use the Elbow method to evaluate the performance of their model during training. The Elbow method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters or classes in a dataset. It works by plotting the explained variance as a function of the number of clusters and identifying the "elbow" point, where adding more clusters does not significantly improve the explained variance. In this case, the researchers apply the Elbow method to the evaluation scores achieved from three different methods to identify the optimal number of freshness classes for each species. By doing so, they can minimize subjectivity and enhance the objectivity of their findings. Additionally, they use internal evaluation metrics such as Silhouette and Calinski-Harabasz to assess the quality of the resulting clusters. These metrics provide insights into how well the clustering algorithm has performed and whether the identified clusters accurately reflect the underlying structure of the data. Overall, the implementation of these strategies allows the researchers to effectively monitor the performance of their model during training and ensure that it produces reliable and meaningful results.
