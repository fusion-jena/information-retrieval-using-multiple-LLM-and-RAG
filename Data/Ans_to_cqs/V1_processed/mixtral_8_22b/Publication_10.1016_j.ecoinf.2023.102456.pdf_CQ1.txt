The provided context does not explicitly mention specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, there are several common ways to collect raw data for deep learning models, including:

1. Surveys or questionnaires: These involve gathering information directly from individuals through structured questions. This method is often used when human input is required, such as sentiment analysis or emotion recognition tasks.

2. Sensors: Various types of sensors can be employed to gather real-time data, such as temperature sensors, accelerometers, gyroscopes, cameras, microphones, etc. These sensors can provide continuous streams of data for applications like object detection, speech recognition, or autonomous vehicles.

3. Public datasets: There are numerous publicly available datasets containing preprocessed data suitable for various deep learning tasks. Examples include ImageNet for image classification, COCO for object detection, and IMDB movie reviews dataset for text classification.

4. Web scraping: Extracting data from websites can also serve as a source of raw data. This technique involves writing scripts or using tools to automatically extract relevant information from web pages.

5. APIs: Application Programming Interfaces allow developers to access data from third-party services, such as social media platforms, weather forecasts, financial markets, etc.

The choice of data collection method depends on the specific requirements of the deep learning task at hand.
