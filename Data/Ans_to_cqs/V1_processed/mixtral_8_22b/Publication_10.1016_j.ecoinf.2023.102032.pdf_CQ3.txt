The given context does not provide specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on common practices in machine learning and Earth observation applications, possible techniques could include bounding box annotation for object detection tasks, such as identifying clouds in satellite imagery, or semantic segmentation for pixel-level classification, like distinguishing different types of land cover. Instance segmentation might also be employed if individual objects within a class need to be identified separately. Without additional information, it cannot be determined which specific technique(s) were utilized in this case.
