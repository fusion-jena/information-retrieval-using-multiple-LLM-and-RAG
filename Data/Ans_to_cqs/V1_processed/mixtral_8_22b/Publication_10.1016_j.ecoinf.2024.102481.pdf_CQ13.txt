Unfortunately, there is no information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model mentioned in the given context. The text discusses the application of machine learning techniques, specifically random forests, for classifying maturity in fish species like Chilean hake. However, it does not provide any details regarding the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model or even if a deep learning model was employed. Therefore, based on the given context, it is impossible to determine which hyperparameters were utilized in the deep learning model.
