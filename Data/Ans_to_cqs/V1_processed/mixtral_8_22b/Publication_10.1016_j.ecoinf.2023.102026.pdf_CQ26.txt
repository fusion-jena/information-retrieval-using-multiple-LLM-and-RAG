The provided context does not directly discuss specific techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it mentions bootstrapping, a technique involving random subsampling with replacement, which can help improve models' precision by reducing stochastic errors in estimation. Bootstrapping is applied to the training data, creating a combination of models that can lead to more accurate results. Although this method is not explicitly mentioned as a solution for data bias, it could potentially contribute to mitigating some forms of bias by introducing randomness into the sampling process. Nonetheless, other methods like those listed in the query would still need to be considered when dealing specifically with data bias issues.
