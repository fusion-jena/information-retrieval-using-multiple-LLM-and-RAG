The article does not provide explicit details about the preprocessing steps used before training their deep learning model. However, it mentions that they aimed to obtain high-quality images for accurate recognition of fish heads and mouths in underwater stereo images. This suggests that some form of image enhancement or filtering might have been applied during preprocessing.

Typically, when working with neural networks and deep learning models, common preprocessing steps include data normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization involves adjusting values measured on different scales to a common scale, while scaling refers to rescaling numerical input features to improve convergence speed during optimization. Cleaning may involve removing outliers, handling missing values, or correcting inconsistent entries in the dataset.

Although the article doesn't specify these exact preprocessing techniques, it is reasonable to assume that similar methods could be employed depending on the nature of the dataset being used for training the deep learning model.
