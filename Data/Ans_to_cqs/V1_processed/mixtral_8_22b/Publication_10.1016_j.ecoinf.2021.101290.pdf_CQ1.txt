Based on the provided context, there isn't explicit information about specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, some insights can be derived indirectly. For instance, the mention of AWS Kinesis and Apache Kibana suggests the use of real-time streaming data, possibly collected through various sources like sensors or other devices. Additionally, references to optogenetics and closed-loop systems imply the use of biological data collection techniques. Furthermore, the discussion around edge computing indicates the potential use of IoT devices or sensors for data gathering. Lastly, the mention of public datasets like Elasticsearch implies the utilization of existing databases for training models. Therefore, while the exact methods aren't specified, one can infer that a combination of real-time data streaming, biological data collection, IoT device data, and publicly available datasets might be employed for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
