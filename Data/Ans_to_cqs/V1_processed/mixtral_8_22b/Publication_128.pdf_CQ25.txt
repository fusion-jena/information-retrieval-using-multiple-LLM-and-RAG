The purpose of the deep learning model in this case is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, based on the description of the model architecture and its application in various studies mentioned in the text, it can be inferred that the primary purpose of the deep learning model is for image classification tasks. Specifically, the model uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which are commonly used for image recognition and classification tasks. The model is designed to extract features from input images using multiple convolutional layers and then use those features to classify the images into different categories. The context mentions several examples where similar models have been used for plant image classification tasks, achieving high levels of accuracy. Therefore, it can be assumed that the purpose of the deep learning model described here is also for image classification, possibly for identifying specific types of diseases in plants based on their leaf images.
