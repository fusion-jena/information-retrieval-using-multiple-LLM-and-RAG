Based on the given information, we cannot directly determine the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, since the study focuses on blue whale vocalizations, it can be inferred that the data format used is likely audio files. The study mentions extracting feature vectors from the test datasets and updating them using trained Gaussian parameters, which suggests that the input data is processed into numerical representations suitable for analysis. Additionally, the study compares the proposed WT-HMM detector with other machine learning detectors, further supporting the assumption that the data format used is compatible with various machine learning algorithms.
