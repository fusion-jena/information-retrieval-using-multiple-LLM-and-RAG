According to the given context, it appears that data augmentation was used to improve the accuracy of bird song classification. Specifically, Shorten and Khoshgoftaar (2019) were cited as a reference for data augmentation methods. While the exact techniques used in this study are not explicitly mentioned, some common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, and adding noise. These techniques help increase the amount of training data available and prevent overfitting by introducing variations in the data. Without more specific details about the data augmentation techniques used in this particular study, I cannot provide a definitive list of the methods employed.
