Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available in the provided context to determine what specific process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only mentions four methods used to model forest AGB, including AdaBoost, random decision forest (RF), multilayer neural network (NET), and Bayesian ridge regression (Bayes). However, it does not provide any details about how these models were deployed or serialized after being trained. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this query based solely on the given context.
