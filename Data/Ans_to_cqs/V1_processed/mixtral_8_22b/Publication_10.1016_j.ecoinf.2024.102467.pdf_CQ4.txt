Unfortunately, there isn't any specific mention of data augmentation techniques used in the given context. However, I can provide you with general information about common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. These include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, translation, shearing, brightness changes, contrast changes, saturation changes, hue shifting, and noise injection. These techniques help increase the diversity of the dataset, prevent overfitting, and improve the robustness of the model.
