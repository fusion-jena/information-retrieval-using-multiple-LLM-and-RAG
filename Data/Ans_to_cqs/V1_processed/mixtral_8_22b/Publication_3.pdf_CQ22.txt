Two metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model: correct identification rate and processing time. The correct identification rate measures the percentage of correctly identified species, while the processing time indicates the efficiency of the model. In Challenge 1, the overall correct identification rate was 94.3%, with 11 species having a 100% correct identification rate and 17 species having a 90% or higher correct identification rate. In Challenge 3, the overall correct identification rate was slightly lower at 94.1%, but still high considering there were 41 species instead of 20. TensorFlow was able to identify 37 of the 41 species with a 90% or higher correct identification rate, including 17 species with a 100% correct identification rate. The lowest correct identification rates were for P. isarog and P. sp. 3 with 70%. No species was found to be consistently misidentified as another particular species.
