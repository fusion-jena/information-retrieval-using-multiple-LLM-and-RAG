The text does not provide explicit information about the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions that the representativeness-oriented method assigns weights to presence points during model training based on assessing the representativeness of the underlying sampling effort. This approach could be considered a form of monitoring model performance during training, as it adjusts the importance of certain data points based on their representativeness. Additionally, the use of two indicators - the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the distance between the observed and predicted values (D) - suggests that these metrics might have been employed to evaluate the model's performance during training. Nevertheless, without more detailed information, it is impossible to definitively state what specific strategy was used to monitor the model performance during training.
