After the model training, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the project. Based on the provided context, it appears that the model was evaluated using various metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, GIoU, and mAP. These metrics were likely calculated during the postprocessing stage to assess the performance of the model. Additionally, the context mentions that the model was trained for 350 epochs and evaluated using scores calculated from model validation data. This suggests that the validation data may have been used to generate saliency maps or confusion matrices to further evaluate the model's performance. However, the context does not explicitly mention any postprocessing steps beyond metric calculation. Therefore, without additional information, it cannot be determined what specific postprocessing steps were taken after the model training.
