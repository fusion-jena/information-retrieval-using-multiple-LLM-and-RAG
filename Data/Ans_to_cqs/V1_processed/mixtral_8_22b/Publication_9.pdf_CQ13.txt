The paper does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the type of optimizer employed. However, it does state that the model uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture and mentions the use of stochastic gradient descent with backpropagation for weight optimization. These details suggest that common hyperparameters associated with these methods were likely considered during the development of the model. Unfortunately, without more detailed information about the implementation, we cannot provide a definitive list of the exact hyperparameters used.
