The text does not provide explicit information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the experiment uses various data augmentation methods such as HSV adjustment, rotation, scaling, cropping, flipping, and mosaicking to expand the dataset. It also discusses the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and the application of feature pyramid networks (FPNs) and bidirectional feature pyramid networks (BiFPNs) for efficiently handling multiscale features. While these techniques are related to the training and optimization of deep learning models, they do not directly address the topic of data annotation. Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
