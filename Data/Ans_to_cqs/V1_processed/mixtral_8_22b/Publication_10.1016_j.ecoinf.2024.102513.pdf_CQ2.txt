In this case, the deep learning pipeline uses image data format. Specifically, it utilizes a stack of various rasters, such as spectral channels from satellite images, which contain information about different wavelengths. These rasters form a multidimensional tensor, where each dimension corresponds to a spectral channel. This input layer receives input data from the raster bands stack and passes them to subsequent layers of the network. Therefore, the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is image data, specifically satellite imagery.
