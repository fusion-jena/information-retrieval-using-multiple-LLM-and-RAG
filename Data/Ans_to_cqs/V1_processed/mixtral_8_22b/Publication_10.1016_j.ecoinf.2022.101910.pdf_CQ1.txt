The method used for collecting raw data in this case is passive acoustic monitoring, which involves deploying audio recorders like AudioMoth to capture sounds produced by birds. This technique is particularly useful for monitoring vocally active taxa, including the Eurasian bittern (Botaurus stellaris). In this study, passive acoustic monitoring was conducted across 17 potential wetlands in northern Spain. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of BirdNET, an automated and freely available classifier capable of identifying over 3000 bird species. While it does not explicitly mention how BirdNET collects its training data, it could potentially utilize publicly available datasets or recordings collected specifically for this purpose.
