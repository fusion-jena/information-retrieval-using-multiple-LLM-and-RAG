To monitor the model performance during training, the authors used the validation dataset to minimize the loss. They employed the stochastic gradient descent with momentum ('sgdm') optimizer for this purpose. The models were trained for a maximum of 10 epochs. This strategy allowed them to evaluate the objective function effectively while ensuring optimal performance of their models.
