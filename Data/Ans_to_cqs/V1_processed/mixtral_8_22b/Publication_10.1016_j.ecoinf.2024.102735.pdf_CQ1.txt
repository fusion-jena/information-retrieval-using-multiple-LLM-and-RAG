In this study, the method utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline involves continuous sensor-based water quality datasets. These datasets are sourced from the Land Development Division of Greenville County and span from December 2014 to July 2021. The parameters measured include pH, temperature, specific conductivity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, saturated dissolved oxygen, oxidation-reduction potential, and chlorophyll-a levels. Measurements of these parameters are facilitated by a strategically positioned YSI multiparameter sonde at Boyd Millpond's outlet, located at coordinates 34°42′27.182″N and 82°25′12′00.0″W, at a depth of 3.0–5.0 ft. Readings are taken at approximately 15 min intervals.
