Based on the given context, it appears there isn't enough information to provide a detailed response regarding the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, I can share some general insights about common postprocessing steps often employed in machine learning projects. These may include:

1. Evaluation metrics: Calculating various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC, etc., depending on the problem type (classification, regression, clustering, etc.).

2. Confusion matrices: Constructing confusion matrices to visualize the performance of classification models, which helps identify false positives, true negatives, false negatives, and true positives.

3. Saliency maps: Generating saliency maps to understand feature importance and how different features contribute to the final prediction. This technique is particularly useful when working with image data.

4. Hyperparameter tuning: Fine-tuning hyperparameters based on cross-validation results to improve model performance further.

5. Model interpretation: Explaining predictions made by complex models like random forests, gradient boosted trees, or neural networks using techniques such as SHAP values, LIME, or partial dependence plots.

6. Ensemble modeling: Combining multiple models to create a single ensemble model that leverages the strengths of individual models.

Please note that these are general postprocessing steps, and their applicability depends on the specific use case and requirements.
