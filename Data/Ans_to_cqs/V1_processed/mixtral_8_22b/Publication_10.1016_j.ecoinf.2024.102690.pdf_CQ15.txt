Based on the given information, it appears that the text discusses the use of Self-Organizing Feature Maps (SOFM) in analyzing ecosystem services (ES) and identifying ecological sources. However, there is no explicit mention of specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) being applied within the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the optimization techniques employed in this particular case.
