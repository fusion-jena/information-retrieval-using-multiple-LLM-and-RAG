The given context does not provide information about the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether a convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), transformer, or any other type of deep learning model was employed. Further details regarding the methodology used in the study would be required to accurately address this query.

Based on the provided context, we can only infer that the authors propose using empirical laboratory experiments combined with mechanistic models to understand the relationship between valve gaping and metabolic functions in bivalves. They suggest that advancements in sensor technology and data collection methods have made it increasingly feasible to gather large datasets on valve gaping, temperature, and chlorophyll levels. These datasets could potentially improve productivity predictions and support decision-making processes in precision shellfish farming. However, there is no mention of any specific deep learning model being utilized in this process.
