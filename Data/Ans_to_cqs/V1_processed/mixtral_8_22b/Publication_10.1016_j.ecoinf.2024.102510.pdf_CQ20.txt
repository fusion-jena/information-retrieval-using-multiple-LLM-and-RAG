The given context does not provide information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. However, based on common practices in deep learning, it is likely that GPU accelerators were used due to their efficiency in handling parallel operations involved in training deep learning models. It is also possible that TPUs or CPUs could have been used, but without explicit mention in the context, we cannot confirm this.
