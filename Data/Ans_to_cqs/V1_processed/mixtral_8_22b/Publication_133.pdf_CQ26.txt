The text does not provide explicit details about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the data originates from various sources with varying formats and reliabilities. This suggests that addressing data bias could be crucial for accurate modeling. Common techniques to handle data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Stratified splitting ensures that each subset maintains the original dataset's class proportions. Oversampling involves duplicating examples from underrepresented classes, while undersampling reduces examples from overrepresented classes. Lastly, collecting diverse data can improve representation and reduce bias. These techniques should be considered when dealing with biased or imbalanced datasets in machine learning applications.
