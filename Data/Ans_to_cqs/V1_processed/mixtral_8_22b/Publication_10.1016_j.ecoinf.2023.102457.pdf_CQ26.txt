While the given context does not directly discuss specific techniques to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, it provides insights into some aspects of working with datasets in deep learning models.

In the context, there is mention of using pre-trained models like BirdNET, VGGish, and Wav2Vec 2.0 for feature extraction and classification tasks. These models were originally trained on various types of audio data, including bird vocalizations, YouTube audio, and human speech audio. Using these pre-trained models can help mitigate data bias by leveraging their prior knowledge gained from diverse datasets.

Additionally, the text mentions that training a model specifically on gibbon vocalization data might improve its performance for individual gibbon discrimination. Collecting diverse data, such as gibbon vocalizations, can contribute to reducing data bias and improving the overall performance of deep learning models.

However, the context does not explicitly state any specific techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection to address data bias during preprocessing. To provide more accurate information regarding those techniques, additional sources would need to be consulted.
