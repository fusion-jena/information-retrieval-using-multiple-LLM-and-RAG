The text does not provide explicit information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it mentions that there is an 'R-package' called 'plantnet', which allows users to query the Pl@ntNet API. This package is said to be available online at <https://github.com/BiologicalRecordsCentre/plantnet>. While this link points to a GitHub repository, it is not clear if this repository contains the entire deep learning pipeline or only the interface to interact with the Pl@ntNet API. Therefore, without further clarification, it cannot be definitively stated where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
