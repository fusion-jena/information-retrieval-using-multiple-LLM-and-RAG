The pipeline primarily utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), specifically the Mask R-CNN model and its variants. The Mask R-CNN model is built around the PyTorch detection model of Mask R-CNN. Additionally, the FGFA implementation uses the PyTorch models for the backbone, the RPN, and the head of the Mask R-CNN model. Three ResNet variations are also employed, which are based on PyTorch detection models. These models are pretrained on datasets such as COCO 2017train and Kinetics-400. Furthermore, the backbone for FGFA is extracted from a Mask R-CNN network trained on a segmentation dataset. During the training process, FGFA trains only the head and the RPN. The flow network in the FGFA architecture is implemented using a SPyNet.
