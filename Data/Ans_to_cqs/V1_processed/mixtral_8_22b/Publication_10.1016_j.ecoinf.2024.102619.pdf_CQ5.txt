The text does not provide explicit information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions three different datasets referred to as Datasets 1, 2, and 3. Each dataset had its own optimal number of epochs determined by early stopping criteria: 14, 14, and 23 epochs for Datasets 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Unfortunately, without additional context or references, it is impossible to determine what these datasets contain or their sources.
