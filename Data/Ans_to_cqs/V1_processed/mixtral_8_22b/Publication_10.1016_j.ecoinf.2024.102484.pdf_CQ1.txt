The study utilizes various methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. For instance, it uses direct acquisition and reclassification by ArcGIS 10.8 for obtaining information about land-use types, elevation, slope, mean annual temperature, precipitation, population density, GDP density, point of interest in residential areas, and point of interest of road and railroad. Additionally, the study employs data from the World Soil Database (HWSD), which is directly acquired. However, due to the limited amount of data publicly available from HWSD, the authors suggest using data from the Basic Soil Property Dataset of High-resolution China Soil Information Grids along with HWSD in future studies to enhance temporal and spatial accuracy. Furthermore, the study mentions the need to combine vegetation degradation and soil degradation research to create a long-term land resource evaluation system for different land-use types in HN.
