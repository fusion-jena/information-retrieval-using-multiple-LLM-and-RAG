The deep learning model was trained using Titan Xp GPUs. Specifically, during the first round of training, a single GPU was utilized to train the model on a subset of 498 images for 9000 iterations. In the second round of training, the model was trained on all 653 annotated images using three GPUs for 18000 iterations. No mention of any other specific hardware resources, such as TPUs, was made in the given context.
