The context does not provide explicit information about the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that deep learning models can handle both structured and unstructured data, which includes images. This suggests that images could be one of the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. Other potential formats might include text, considering the mention of 'text' alongside 'images'. It's important to note that the context doesn't explicitly state whether these are the only formats used or if others like audio, video, or CSV files are also included. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, we can infer that images and possibly text are among the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.
