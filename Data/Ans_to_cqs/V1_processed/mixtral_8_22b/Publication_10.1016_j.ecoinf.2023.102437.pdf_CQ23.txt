The text does not explicitly mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, some common practices to ensure the generalizability of machine learning models include using diverse datasets, cross-validation, and stratified splitting. These techniques help prevent overfitting and increase the robustness of the model by ensuring that it performs well on unseen data. It is important to note that the authors did compare the performance of different models, including the Random Forest (RF) model and the Lasso model, in forecasting ENSO. They also mentioned that the number of trees in the RF models was defined downstream, and all their models were composed of 200 trees. This suggests that they may have implemented some form of parameter tuning or cross-validation to optimize the performance of their models. However, without more explicit details about the specific steps taken to ensure generalizability, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer.
