The considered dataset was divided into three datasets for different purposes in the deep learning model training process. The first dataset contained 22,666 images used for training the model (training set). The second dataset consisted of 7,554 images utilized for validating the trained model (validation set). Lastly, the third dataset included another 7,554 images employed for evaluating the model's performance (testing set). These divisions allowed for proper assessment and optimization of the model during its development and ensured reliable evaluation of its final performance.
