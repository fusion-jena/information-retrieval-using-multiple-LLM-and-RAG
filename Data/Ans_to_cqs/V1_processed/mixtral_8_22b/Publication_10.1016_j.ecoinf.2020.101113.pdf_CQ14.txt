Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to determine how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. The text mentions using a pre-trained ResNet50 model but does not provide details about the optimization process or techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer based on the available information.
