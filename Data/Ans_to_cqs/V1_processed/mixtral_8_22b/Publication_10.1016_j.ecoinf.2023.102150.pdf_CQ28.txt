The deep learning model was deployed on a cloud service with 1 GPU, 4 CPUs, and 16 GB RAM provided by Sigma2 - the National Infrastructure for High Performance Computing and Data Storage in Norway. However, it does not explicitly state which specific platform (such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform) was used. Therefore, based on the given information, I cannot determine the exact platform used to deploy the deep learning model.
