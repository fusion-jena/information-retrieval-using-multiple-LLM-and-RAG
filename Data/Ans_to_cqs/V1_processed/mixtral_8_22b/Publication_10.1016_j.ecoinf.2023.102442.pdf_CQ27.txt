The text does not provide explicit information about how the trained deep learning model was deployed. However, it mentions that the initial land use/land cover (LULC) classification was done using Google Earth Engine (GEE), a cloud processing platform. This suggests that GEE might have been used for deploying the trained deep learning model as well. Additionally, the text discusses the use of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets available through GEE's public catalog, indicating that these resources may have been utilized during the deployment process. Unfortunately, without more specific details regarding the deployment method or steps taken, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer.
