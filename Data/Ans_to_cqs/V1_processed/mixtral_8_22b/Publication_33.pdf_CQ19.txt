The paper does not explicitly mention the use of any specific deep learning framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. However, it references TensorFlow in its citations [43], suggesting that it may have been considered during the research process. Additionally, the authors discuss building a convolutional neural network (CNN) for species identification, which could potentially involve using one of these popular deep learning frameworks. Nonetheless, without explicit confirmation, it remains uncertain which framework was employed in constructing the deep learning model.
