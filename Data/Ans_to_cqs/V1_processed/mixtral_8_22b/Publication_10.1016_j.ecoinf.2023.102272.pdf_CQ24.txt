The text does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, including the use of random seed values. However, it mentions that the model selection procedure involves generating five models for each of the four available deep-ANN architectures, which suggests some form of randomization. Additionally, the process includes training each model with a small subset of the training data for four epochs before selecting the model with the highest performance for further training on the full training data. This implies that there may be some inherent variability due to the stochastic nature of the training process. To mitigate this, researchers often employ techniques like fixing the random seed value, averaging multiple runs, or using cross-validation to ensure more robust and reliable results.
