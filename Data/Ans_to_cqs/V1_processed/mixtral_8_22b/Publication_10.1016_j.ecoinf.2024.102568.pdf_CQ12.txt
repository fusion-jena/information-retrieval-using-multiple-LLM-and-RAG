The deep learning model used in the pipeline is Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), which is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN). This is evident from multiple mentions throughout the given context, including phrases like "LSTM model," "structure of the LSTM cell," and comparisons made with other RNN architectures such as Multilayer Perceptron and Gate Recurrent Unit.
