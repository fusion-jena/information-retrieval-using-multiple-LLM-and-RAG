The given context does not provide information about the specific data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. However, some common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, and shifting images. These techniques help increase the size of the dataset and prevent overfitting by creating new training examples from existing ones. It is important to note that the choice of data augmentation technique depends on the nature of the problem being solved and the characteristics of the dataset.

The references provided in the context focus mainly on climate change, ecological information, and plant invasions, rather than deep learning pipelines or data augmentation techniques. Therefore, it would be best to refer to other resources specifically focused on deep learning and computer vision to find more detailed information on this topic.
