The context does not provide specific details about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model used for creating the map of 2020 iceplant locations in Santa Barbara County. However, it mentions leveraging cloud computing and machine learning to analyze remotely sensed data. Typically, after training a deep learning model, one might follow these steps for deployment:

1. Model Serialization: Save the trained model parameters into a file or database so they can be loaded later during prediction time. Common formats include.h5 for Keras models,.pt for PyTorch models, and.pb for TensorFlow models.

2. Platform Selection: Choose a platform to host the deployed model. Popular options include cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform, which offer services such as Amazon SageMaker, Azure Machine Learning Studio, and AI Platform respectively. These platforms allow users to easily manage, serve, and monitor their models.

3. Deployment: Upload the serialized model onto the chosen platform and configure any necessary settings, such as scaling policies, security permissions, and API gateways. Once set up, the model will be ready to receive input data and return predictions.

Since the context doesn't explicitly mention these steps, we cannot confirm if they were followed for deploying the trained deep learning model.
