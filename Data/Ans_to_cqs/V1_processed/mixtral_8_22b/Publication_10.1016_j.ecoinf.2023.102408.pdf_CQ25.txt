Based on the given context, it appears that the deep learning models mentioned are primarily being used for nonlinear regression modeling. Specifically, they are employed to predict Above Ground Biomass (AGB) by utilizing remote sensing data from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites.

Three different types of deep learning models have been discussed in the context: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Each of these models serves a specific purpose within the broader goal of accurately estimating AGB.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs): These are used for modeling complex phenomena and developing nonlinear regressions. In this case, ANNs are utilized to create a single hidden-layer neural network with two hyperparameters: size and decay. The size refers to the number of units in the hidden layer, while decay is a regularization parameter aimed at preventing overfitting. The ultimate objective is to find the optimal combination of parameters that yields the most accurate model fit.

Random Forest (RF): This algorithm is known for its ability to handle large datasets and provide accurate information about critical factors. Its primary use here is to generate predictions for AGB. However, it does come with some limitations, such as increased model complexity when dealing with numerous predictors and the potential for overfitting if parameters like'mtry' and 'ntree' aren't appropriately adjusted. To mitigate these issues, this study systematically evaluates'mtry' values ranging from 1 to 10, striving to achieve a balance between stability and minimal Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

Support Vector Machine (SVM): While no explicit details are provided about the role of SVM in this context, it is generally used for classification and regression tasks. Given that both ANNs and RF are employed for nonlinear regression, it can be inferred that SVM might serve a similar purpose in this scenario.

Overall, the main purpose of these deep learning models is to develop robust and accurate nonlinear regression models capable of predicting AGB using satellite imagery data.
