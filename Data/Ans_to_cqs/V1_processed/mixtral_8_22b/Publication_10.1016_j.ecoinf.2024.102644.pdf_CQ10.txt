Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention or reference to a specific code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the use of data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) repository for building a robust distribution model for Architeuthis Dux, improving data quality, classifying climate change effects on marine species distributions, and modeling habitat suitability. Additionally, it mentions various research papers related to these topics but does not provide any direct links to a deep learning pipeline code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific code repository link for a deep learning pipeline based on the given context.
