Based on the given information, it appears that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images. There are multiple mentions of datasets containing thousands of images of various bird species. For instance, there is mention of a dataset consisting of 83 bird species native to Indonesia, which includes 8057 images. Additionally, another dataset contains 31,320 images of 29 bird species. Furthermore, the process involves resizing these images to fit the requirements of the models being trained. Therefore, based on the available information, we can conclude that the main data format utilized in this deep learning pipeline is images.
