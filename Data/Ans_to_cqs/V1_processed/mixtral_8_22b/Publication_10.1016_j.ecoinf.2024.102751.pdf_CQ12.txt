Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to determine what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline. The given references do not provide any details about using a specific deep learning model such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. However, the conclusion mentions testing various methods of machine learning or deep neural networks in the future to increase the accuracy of predictions. Therefore, we can infer that no particular deep learning model has been implemented yet, but they plan to explore different options later.
