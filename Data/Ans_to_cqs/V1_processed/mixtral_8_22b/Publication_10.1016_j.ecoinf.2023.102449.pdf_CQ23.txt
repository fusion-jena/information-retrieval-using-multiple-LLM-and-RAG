The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it mentions using a wide residual network architecture inspired by BirdNet's encoder, which could potentially contribute to better generalization. Additionally, the use of rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation functions might help improve the model's performance and generalization.

While there is no direct mention of diverse datasets or validation techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting, these are common practices in machine learning to enhance model generalizability. It would be reasonable to assume that some form of data partitioning was employed during training, testing, and validation stages, but without further details, one cannot definitively state whether those methods were utilized.
