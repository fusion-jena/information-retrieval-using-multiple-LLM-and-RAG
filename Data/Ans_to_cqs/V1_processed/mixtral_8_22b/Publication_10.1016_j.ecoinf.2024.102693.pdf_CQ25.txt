The text does not provide explicit information about the specific task or purpose of the deep learning models mentioned, such as classification, segmentation, or detection. However, it mentions that these models are used in various downstream recognition and detection tasks. Therefore, we can infer that the purpose of these deep learning models could include image recognition, object detection, or other related tasks in computer vision.

Based on the given context, the purpose of the deep learning models discussed seems to revolve around improving their performance in various computer vision tasks. For instance, the Transformer-like model aims to enhance spatial and channel information fusion using token mixers and MLP modules. Similarly, the CNN-like model focuses on addressing gradient disappearance issues and enabling deeper networks for better feature extraction. Lastly, the MLP-like model appears to be designed for classification purposes, as indicated by the presence of a fully connected layer at the end of the network.
