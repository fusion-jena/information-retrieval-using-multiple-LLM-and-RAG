The machine learning pipeline uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) called VGG16 as the base model. The VGG16 network is sourced from the Torch library and serves as the foundation for each modeling approach. For the CNN + SVM modeling approach, the architecture is kept up to the first fully connected layer (FC1), creating a feature extractor. Then, it is paired with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) sourced from the Scikit-Learn library. Two types of SVM are evaluated: a linear SVM and a non-linear SVM, known as a Radial Basis Function (RBF). On the other hand, for the pure CNN approach, the full VGG16 network is utilized, leaving the feature extractor and classifier intact.
