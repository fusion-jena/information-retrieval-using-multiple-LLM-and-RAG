The given context does not provide explicit information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for the discussed network (Faster R-CNN). However, it can be assumed that common optimization techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) could potentially be employed in the training phase of the Faster R-CNN network. These optimization algorithms are widely used in deep learning pipelines to minimize loss functions during the training process. Nonetheless, without further details regarding the implementation of the Faster R-CNN network mentioned in the context, it cannot be definitively stated which specific optimization technique was utilized.
