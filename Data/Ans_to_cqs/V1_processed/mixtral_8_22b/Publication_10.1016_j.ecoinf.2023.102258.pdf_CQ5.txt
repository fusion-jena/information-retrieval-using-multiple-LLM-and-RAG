Based on the given context, it appears that two specific datasets were mentioned: QU and MGE. However, there is no explicit mention of other commonly known datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Therefore, we cannot definitively state what datasets were used in the deep learning pipelines described here. It should be noted that the context primarily discusses challenges related to applying deep learning techniques in bioacoustics due to limited availability of labeled audio examples and fine-grained annotations.
