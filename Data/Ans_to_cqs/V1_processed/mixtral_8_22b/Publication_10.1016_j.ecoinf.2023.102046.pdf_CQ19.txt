The text does not explicitly mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models. However, it mentions using the HuggingFace implementations of ViT and ResNet, and the Keras implementation of Inception-V3. This suggests that the models might have been implemented using either TensorFlow or PyTorch, as both these libraries support HuggingFace and Keras APIs. Specifically, HuggingFace supports both TensorFlow and PyTorch backends, while Keras is a high-level API that runs on top of TensorFlow. Therefore, it can be inferred that the models could have been built using either TensorFlow or PyTorch, depending on the backend chosen for each implementation.
