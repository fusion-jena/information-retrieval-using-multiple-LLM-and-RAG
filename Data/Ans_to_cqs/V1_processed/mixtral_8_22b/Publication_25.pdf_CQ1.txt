In this study, the researchers utilize data from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) site at the San Joaquin Experimental Range in California. Specifically, they use LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technology to collect data for their deep learning pipeline. LIDAR is a remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure distances. By measuring how long it takes for the pulse to bounce back to its source, LIDAR can accurately determine the distance between the sensor and the target object. In this case, the researchers use LIDAR to detect trees and generate initial training data for their deep learning model. Additionally, they mention the possibility of combining LIDAR data with other types of data, such as hyperspectral images, to provide more detailed information about the environment being studied. However, they note that further research is needed to understand the best ways to integrate different types of data in order to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of deep learning models.
