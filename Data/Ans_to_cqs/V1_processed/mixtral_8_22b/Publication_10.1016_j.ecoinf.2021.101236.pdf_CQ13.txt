The given context does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model. However, it provides information about other aspects of the model architecture and training process. For instance, the overall process follows current best practices in deep learning, including the use of batch normalization and ReLU activation functions. Additionally, the model employs a modified version of the Wide ResNet design, incorporating changes suggested in Xie et al. (2018), and uses a classification block based on Schl√ºter (2018). Furthermore, most convolutions utilize 3x3 kernels with padding, and the input is a single-channel mel spectrogram of size 64x384. While these details do not directly reveal the hyperparameters like learning rate or optimizer, they offer valuable insight into the structure and components of the deep learning model used for bird species classification.
