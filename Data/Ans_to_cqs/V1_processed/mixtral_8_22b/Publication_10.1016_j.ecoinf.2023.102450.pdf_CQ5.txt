Based on the given context, it is unclear which specific datasets were used in the deep learning pipeline. However, there is mention of a custom dataset containing three classes: circular curves, straight lines, and 8-shaped curves. This dataset consists of 10, 22, and 10 videos respectively, with durations of 927s, 1374s, and 678s. Each video contains 27,819, 41,225, and 20,340 images respectively. Additionally, the text mentions the use of a few-shot learning method due to an insufficient number of samples in the training dataset. Unfortunately, no other well-known datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet are explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
