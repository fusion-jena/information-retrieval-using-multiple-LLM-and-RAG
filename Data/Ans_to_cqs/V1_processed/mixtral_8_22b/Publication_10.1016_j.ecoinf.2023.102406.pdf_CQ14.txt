The text mentions that modeling package options enable automated tuning for parameters through resampling and standard default values to reach the most accurate final model configuration. This suggests that the hyperparameters of the model could potentially be optimized using techniques such as grid search or random search, which involve trying out different combinations of hyperparameter values and selecting the combination that results in the best performance. However, the exact method used for hyperparameter optimization is not explicitly stated in the given context.
