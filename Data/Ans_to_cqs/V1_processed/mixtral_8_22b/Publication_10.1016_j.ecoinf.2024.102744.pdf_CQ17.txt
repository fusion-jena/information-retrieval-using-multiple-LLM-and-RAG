The text mentions the use of the Dropout layer as a method to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. Dropout is a regularization technique used during training to randomly set a fraction rate of input units to 0 at each update, which helps reduce interdependent learning amongst neurons. By doing so, it prevents overfitting and improves the generalization capability of the model. Other common regularization techniques not explicitly mentioned in the given context but widely used in deep learning pipelines include L1 and L2 regularizations, early stopping, and data augmentation. These methods help control the complexity of the model and improve its ability to perform well on unseen data.
