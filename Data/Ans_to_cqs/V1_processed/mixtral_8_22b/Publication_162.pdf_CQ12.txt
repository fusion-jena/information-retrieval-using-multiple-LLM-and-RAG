The paper uses a modified version of Mask R-CNN, which is a type of convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for object instance segmentation. The authors refer to their modified version as D-Mask R-CNN. They use this model to detect instances of deer in their RGB-D dataset. The model is trained on the Microsoft COCO dataset and utilizes a feature fusion module to combine extracted features from two different backbones.
