The text does not provide explicit information about the specific process used to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. However, it mentions that the model was tested using a separate test set, indicating that the model had already been deployed after being trained and validated. This suggests that standard procedures were likely followed for deploying the model, but without further details, we cannot confirm the exact steps taken.
