The context does not provide specific details regarding the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that a neural network was trained using certain datasets to develop a classifier capable of accurately identifying various land cover forms based on their spectral signatures. These datasets likely consisted of satellite images containing spectral channels from different wavelengths, forming a multidimensional tensor where each dimension corresponded to a spectral channel. Unfortunately, without more specific information, we cannot determine if well-known datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet were utilized in this case.
