To monitor the model performance during training, the authors employed a strategy involving the creation of several small sampling plots within each vegetation type rather than using one large area. This approach aimed to ensure that the training and validation points were representative of the diverse vegetation within each boundary. They determined the size of these sampling plots by calculating 5% of the total area covered by the boundary and dividing it by the number of vegetation types intersecting the boundary.

Furthermore, to prevent the misclassification of smaller woody plants, such as shrubs, due to an unbalanced training set resulting from a completely random sampling protocol, the authors introduced a separate geometry called 'add trees.' This geometry included well-defined examples of woody cover elements until both classes had the same number of training points. Subsequently, this new geometry was merged with the randomly allocated woody points, forming a single class named'merged woody.'

Finally, to evaluate the model's accuracy, the authors randomly split the classified points into an 80/20% ratio to create a training/validation dataset. This dataset would later be utilized in the accuracy assessments.
