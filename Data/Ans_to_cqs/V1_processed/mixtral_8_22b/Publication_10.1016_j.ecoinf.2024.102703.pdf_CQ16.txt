The criterion used to determine when training is complete in this case is the training error being set to 0.001. Additionally, the maximum number of training times is also specified as 10,000. These two conditions will be met before the training process stops. However, it should be noted that these specific values may vary depending on the particular application or dataset being used. In general, other common stopping criteria include reaching a certain level of performance on a validation set, such as a minimum validation loss or a plateau in validation loss improvement.
