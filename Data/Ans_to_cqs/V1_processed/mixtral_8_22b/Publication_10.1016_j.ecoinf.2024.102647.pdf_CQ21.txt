After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the project. Some common postprocessing steps include:

1. Model Evaluation: This involves calculating various metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, kappa, AUC, R2, COR, KGE, etc., to evaluate the performance of the trained model. These metrics help determine how well the model is able to predict the desired output based on the input data. In this case, the table shows that the Random Forest (RF) model has better performance compared to the Classification and Regression Trees (CART) model in terms of all the mentioned evaluation criteria.

2. Confusion Matrix: It is a table used to describe the performance of a classification model. The confusion matrix contains information about actual and predicted classifications done by a classification system. Performance of such systems is commonly evaluated using the data in the matrix.

3. Saliency Maps: They are visualizations that highlight which pixels in an image contribute most strongly to the prediction made by a deep learning model. These maps can provide insights into what features the model is focusing on when making its predictions. However, it seems like there is no mention of saliency maps being used in this particular study.

In summary, some possible postprocessing steps after model training could involve evaluating the model with different metrics, creating a confusion matrix, and generating saliency maps. However, not all these steps may be necessary or relevant for every project.
