One of the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context is data augmentation. Data augmentation helps to extend the amount of information by adding adjusted copies of already existing data. This method acts as a regularizer and makes a difference in reducing overfitting. During the training process, each image was randomly sampled by one of the following options: the entire original image, horizontal flip, grayscale, blur, noise, and cropping. These operations helped to create new variations of the existing data, thus increasing the diversity of the training set and preventing the model from memorizing the training data. Other common regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization are not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
