Based on the provided context, it appears that the study employs the Random Forest (RF) model to examine the relative importance of selected environmental and anthropogenic variables on invasive plant species richness and abundance. However, there is no explicit information regarding the specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. In general, when implementing machine learning models like Random Forest, strategies such as cross-validation or bootstrapping can be employed to assess the model's performance during training. These methods help evaluate how well the model will perform on unseen data and prevent overfitting. Without further details, it cannot be determined which specific strategy was utilized in this case.
