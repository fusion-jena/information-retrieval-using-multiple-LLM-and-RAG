The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the model aims to strike a balance between speed and accuracy. It uses AlexNet as its backbone and employs a method of cascading multiple activation functions to introduce nonlinear factors. This approach allows the model to approximate the nonlinear expression function of the learning features and improve gradient propagation. Additionally, the model is designed to be lightweight and optimized for deep training and short-term testing. By merging two convolution layers and reducing the number of layers in the model, computational efficiency is improved, and the inference time of the model is significantly shortened. While the exact purpose of the model is not specified, it appears to be focused on maintaining high performance while minimizing computational complexity and deployment costs.
