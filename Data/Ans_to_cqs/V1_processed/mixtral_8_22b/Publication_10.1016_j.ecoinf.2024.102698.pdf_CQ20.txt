Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it does state that convolutional neural networks (CNN), autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks (GAN) were used, which are known to be computationally expensive and require significant computational power. Therefore, it can be inferred that powerful hardware resources such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) would likely have been required for training these models.
