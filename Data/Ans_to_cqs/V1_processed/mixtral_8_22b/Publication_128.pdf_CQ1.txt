The given context does not provide specific details on the method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on common practices in deep learning projects, raw data can be collected using various methods such as surveys, sensors, or utilizing publicly available datasets. Surveys can be conducted to gather labeled data directly from users, while sensors can collect unlabeled data automatically. Publicly available datasets can also be used, which often contain preprocessed and labeled data ready for use in machine learning tasks. Without explicit mention in the provided context, we cannot determine the exact method used for gathering raw data in this particular case.
