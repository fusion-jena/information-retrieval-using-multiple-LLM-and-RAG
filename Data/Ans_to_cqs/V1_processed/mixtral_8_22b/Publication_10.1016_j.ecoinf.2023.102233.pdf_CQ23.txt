The authors employed several measures to improve the generalizability of their deep learning model. Firstly, they utilized an active learning approach which involved iterative training and improvement of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. This process helped refine the model by incorporating feedback from its own predictions, thereby enhancing its performance and applicability to new datasets.

Secondly, the researchers implemented a grid search technique to fine-tune the hyperparameters of the final model. This strategy systematically explores different combinations of parameters to identify the optimal configuration, thus improving the model's adaptability to various scenarios.

Moreover, the study addressed the issue of class imbalance within the evaluation data through a random selection approach that was stratified across the model's predictions (logits). Although this method altered the original data distribution, it significantly mitigated class imbalance and enabled the computation of dependable evaluation metrics. However, the authors acknowledged that further investigation is required to develop suitable evaluation methods for highly imbalanced and unlabeled test data.

Lastly, while not explicitly mentioned in the given context, the inclusion of diverse datasets and cross-validation techniques could also contribute to ensuring the generalizability of the deep learning model. These practices help prevent overfitting and enhance the model's ability to perform well on previously unseen data.
