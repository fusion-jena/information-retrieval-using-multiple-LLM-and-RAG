The given context does not provide information about the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses the use of varying dataset sizes and their impact on the performance of a wavelet transform hidden Markov model (WT-HMM) classifier. It also mentions the division of datasets into subsets for training and testing purposes, along with the utilization of 75% of the dataset subset for training the model and the remaining 25% for evaluating its classification performance. Unfortunately, there is no mention of any regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization in this context.
