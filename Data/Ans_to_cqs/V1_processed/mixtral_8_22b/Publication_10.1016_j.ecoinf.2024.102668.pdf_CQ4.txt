The given context does not provide information on specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotation, or scaling. However, it discusses the importance of reducing device bias when using different recording devices for collecting acoustic data. This is crucial for enhancing the applicability of acoustic indices for broader comparative analyses and extending their use to fields like machine learning and deep learning. The study compares inter-brand and intra-brand devices with varying sample schemes, sampling frequencies, and gain settings. It also mentions the potential application of acoustic indices in complex sonic environments for ecological monitoring. In summary, while the text does not explicitly mention data augmentation techniques, it emphasizes the need for consistency in feature spaces across studies regardless of the recording device used, which can be relevant when considering data preprocessing and augmentation strategies in a deep learning pipeline.
