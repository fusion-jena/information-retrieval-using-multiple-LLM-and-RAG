The given context does not provide any explicit information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions the use of specific tools such as TensorFlow and NumPy, along with details on the operating system and development environment. However, there is no mention of any public repositories like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available based on the provided context.
