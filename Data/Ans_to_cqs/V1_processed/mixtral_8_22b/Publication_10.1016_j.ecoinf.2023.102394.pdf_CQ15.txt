Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it mentions that a deep learning algorithm called the multilayer perceptron (MLP) was used for SOCS modeling. The MLP is a type of feedforward artificial neural network consisting of an input layer, multiple hidden layers, and an output layer. It uses activation functions to connect adjacent layers and extract features for prediction. While the context does not explicitly state which optimization techniques were employed, common optimization techniques used with MLPs include backpropagation, gradient descent, and various adaptive learning rate algorithms like SGD and Adam.
