The text does not explicitly mention all the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does indicate that one technique was employed for the specific task of identifying whales in aerial images. This technique involves bounding box annotation, where each whale in the image is enclosed within a rectangular boundary. This method is commonly used in object detection tasks, allowing the model to learn the visual characteristics of the target objects (whales in this case) and distinguish them from the background or other objects in the image. Other potential data annotation techniques that could have been used but are not mentioned include semantic segmentation (where every pixel in the image is assigned a class label), instance segmentation (which combines object detection and semantic segmentation to identify individual instances of objects), and landmark annotation (used for facial recognition tasks).
