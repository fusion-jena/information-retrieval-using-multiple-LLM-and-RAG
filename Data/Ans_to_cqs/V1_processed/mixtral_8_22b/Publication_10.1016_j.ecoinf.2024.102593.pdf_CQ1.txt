The primary method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is through the use of digital recorders set in the field. These devices continuously collect high-resolution digital data, which is then retrieved and processed to identify target species. This approach allows for the gathering of vast amounts of data, often measured in terabytes. However, due to the labor-intensive nature of manually labeling such extensive data, automatic processing techniques like deep neural networks (DNN) have become popular tools for handling these large volumes of bioacoustic sound recordings.
