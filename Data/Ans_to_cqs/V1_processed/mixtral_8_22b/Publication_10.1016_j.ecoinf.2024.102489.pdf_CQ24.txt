The given context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or managing random seed values. However, it does provide information about how randomness is handled in the Random Forest (RF) model, which could be relevant to understanding general approaches to managing randomness in machine learning algorithms.

In the case of the RF model, randomness is introduced through the random selection of samples and characteristic variables during the construction of decision trees. To manage this randomness and optimize the performance of the RF model, several strategies are employed:

1. Cross-validation: In this study, a five-fold cross-validation approach was used to evaluate the performance of the RF model. Cross-validation helps ensure that the model can generalize well to unseen data and reduces the risk of overfitting.

2. Grid Search Method: A grid search method (GridSearchCV) was utilized to find the optimal parameters for the RF model. By systematically searching across a range of parameter values, this method aims to identify the best combination of hyperparameters that minimize the out-of-bag (OOB) error.

3. Parameter Tuning: Specific parameters such as the number of trees (n\_estimators), minimum number of leaves (minleaf), and the number of randomly selected node-split feature variables (max\_features) were adjusted to improve the accuracy and complexity of the model. These adjustments help control the level of randomness introduced into the model.

Although these strategies do not explicitly address the management of random seeds in deep learning pipelines, they demonstrate some common techniques for controlling randomness in machine learning models. Managing randomness in deep learning often involves setting fixed random seeds, using deterministic algorithms, or employing ensemble methods like bagging or boosting to reduce variance caused by randomness.
