The text does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the data format used is likely images since the study focuses on analyzing the performance of various Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, which are primarily designed for image classification tasks. Additionally, the authors discuss using raw and pre-processed images in their experiments. Therefore, it can be concluded that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is likely images.
