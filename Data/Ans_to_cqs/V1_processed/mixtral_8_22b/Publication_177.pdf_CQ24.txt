The given context does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it mentions several strategies commonly used in developing and comparing deep learning models for plant species identification tasks. These include splitting datasets into training, validation, and testing sets; employing various deep learning architectures like GoogleNet, ResNet, and ResNeXT with different configurations; and utilizing ensemble methods such as stacking and bagging. While these strategies do not directly address randomness due to factors like initial weights or random seed values, they contribute to improving model robustness and generalization. To manage randomness explicitly, common practices include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, averaging multiple runs with different seeds, or applying techniques like cross-validation.
