Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It mentions that a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was used, but it does not specify whether the training was done using GPUs, TPUs, or any other type of hardware resource. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer based solely on the given context.
