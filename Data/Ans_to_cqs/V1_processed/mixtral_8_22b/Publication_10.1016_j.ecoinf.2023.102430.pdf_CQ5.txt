The article does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in their deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that they trained all algorithms on a random subset of 5256 pictures (80% of the 6570-picture dataset). It appears that this dataset consists of low-resolution pictures of three genera of triatomines - Triatoma, Panstrongylus, and Rhodnius, which are known vectors of human Chagas disease. These pictures were likely captured using ordinary cellphone cameras, as the study aimed to test the accuracy of identifying these genera using such images. Therefore, while the exact names of the datasets are not given, it can be inferred that the authors created their own dataset consisting of low-resolution pictures of triatomines.
