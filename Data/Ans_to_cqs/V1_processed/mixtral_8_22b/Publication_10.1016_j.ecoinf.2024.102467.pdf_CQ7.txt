Based on the given context, it does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, or validation sets. However, generally, in machine learning and deep learning models, the dataset is often divided into three subsets: training, validation, and testing datasets.

The training dataset is used to fit the model, i.e., to learn the relationship between input features and target variables. The validation dataset is used during the model development phase to fine-tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Lastly, the testing dataset is used after the final model has been selected to evaluate its performance on unseen data.

Typical criteria used to split the data include random sampling, stratified sampling, or time-series based splitting. Random sampling involves randomly selecting instances from the entire dataset to create each subset. Stratified sampling ensures that each subset maintains the same class distribution as the original dataset. Time-series based splitting is useful when dealing with sequential data, where the order of observations matters.

Without specific details regarding the dataset or the problem domain, it is difficult to determine which criterion would be most appropriate for splitting the data in this case.
