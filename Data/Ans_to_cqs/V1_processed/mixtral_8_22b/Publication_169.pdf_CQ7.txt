Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, typically, datasets are divided into three subsets: training, testing, and validation sets. The most common approach is to use a random stratified sampling method to maintain the same distribution of classes in each subset. A typical ratio for splitting the data could be 70% for training, 20% for testing, and 10% for validation. This allows the model to learn patterns from the majority of the data during training, evaluate its generalization capabilities on unseen data during testing, and fine-tune hyperparameters or prevent overfitting during validation.
