Based on the given context, it appears that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images. This is evident from the numerous mentions of image datasets and image classification throughout the text. For instance, the evaluation of classifiers section discusses how the collected dataset was trained and evaluated using various residual structures and models such as Inception-v3, VGG-11, VGG-19, Alex Net, GoogleNet, and Squeeze Net models. Additionally, the evaluation criteria of classifiers section specifies that the performance of all image classification models was assessed using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1-score. Furthermore, the mention of MATLAB R2016a software being used for carrying out classification operations further supports the notion that images are the main data format utilized in this particular deep learning pipeline. However, there is no explicit mention of any other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV files being employed in the deep learning process. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, we can conclude that the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is images.
