In this study, the dataset was divided into a training set and a validation set for each species. Leave-one-out cross-validation was performed, which involved removing a single bird from the dataset for each species, training the model on the other birds, and then validating the model on the single bird. This process was repeated until all birds had been removed once and tested against the remaining birds. The area under the receiving operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predicted value (PPV), and negative predicted value (NPV) were calculated for both training and validation data. Sensitivity and specificity measure the proportion of positives and negatives correctly identified, respectively, in the withheld data. PPV is the number of true predicted positives divided by all predicted positives, while NPV is the number of true negatives divided by all predicted negatives. A perfect model would have high sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV. These metrics, along with validation AUC, were used to determine the optimal model for each species.
