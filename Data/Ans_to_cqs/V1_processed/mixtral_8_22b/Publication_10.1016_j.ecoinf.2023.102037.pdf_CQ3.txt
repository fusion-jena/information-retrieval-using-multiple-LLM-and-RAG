The context does not provide explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the mentioned deep learning pipelines. However, it is possible to infer some potential methods based on common practices in similar applications.

For example, Wang et al. (2020a, 2020b, 2020c) used the YOLOv3 (Redmon & Farhadi, 2018) object detection algorithm to detect and classify pest species from their "Pest24" dataset. This suggests that they likely used bounding box annotations during the training phase, as this is a standard technique for object detection tasks. Similarly, Rustia et al. (2021) employed a multi-stage deep learning approach involving object detection, insect vs. non-insect separation, and multi-class insect classification. Again, this implies the use of bounding boxes or other forms of localization annotations for both object detection and classification stages.

Furthermore, considering that these studies focus on identifying and classifying various pest species, it is reasonable to assume that instance segmentation might have been utilized as well. Instance segmentation involves assigning individual labels to each pixel within an object, allowing for more precise identification and differentiation between closely related species. While the context does not explicitly mention the use of instance segmentation, its application would be consistent with the goals of these research projects.

In summary, although the context does not directly state the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipelines, it is plausible that bounding box annotations and potentially instance segmentation were employed due to their relevance in object detection and classification tasks.
