The deep learning pipeline primarily uses two types of data formats - audio and visual data. Initially, the acquired audio files are segmented into 15-second windows. These segments are then fed into a feature extraction function which utilizes Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) to extract relevant features from the audio samples. This indicates that the primary format of input data used in the initial stages of the pipeline is audio data.

Additionally, the study also mentions the use of visual data in conjunction with acoustic data to enhance the capabilities of the platform. Specifically, Figure 12 refers to 'Bird Classification Using Visual Data', suggesting that images or videos may be utilized alongside audio data to analyze and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the habitat. However, it should be noted that the specific details regarding the pre-processing stages or the exact nature of the visual data used are not explicitly mentioned within the given context.

Therefore, based on the information available, it can be concluded that the deep learning pipeline predominantly employs audio data, but also incorporates visual data to some extent. Other common data formats like CSV or text data do not appear to play a significant role in this particular pipeline.
