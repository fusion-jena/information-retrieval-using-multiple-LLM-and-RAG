The paper does not provide information about any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning models used for fire risk mapping. However, it mentions that various machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine, Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network, and Random Forests were evaluated for their performance in predicting fire risk. It also states that the fire risk maps were classified into four categories using Jenks' natural breaks classification method in ArcGIS 10.6. This approach minimizes the variance within classes while maximizing the variance across types, which could potentially improve the generalizability of the results. Nevertheless, without further details regarding the validation methods or datasets used, it is difficult to determine the extent to which these measures contribute to the overall generalizability of the deep learning models.
