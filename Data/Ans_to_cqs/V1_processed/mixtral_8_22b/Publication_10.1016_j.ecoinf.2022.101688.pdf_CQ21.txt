The provided context does not explicitly mention any postprocessing steps involved after the model training such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, confusion matrix, etc. However, based on general practices in machine learning, some common postprocessing steps could include evaluating the performance of the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves, etc. Additionally, creating a confusion matrix can help understand the types of errors made by the model. Visualizing the results through techniques like saliency maps can also provide insights into how the model arrived at its predictions. These steps would depend on the specific requirements and goals of the project.
