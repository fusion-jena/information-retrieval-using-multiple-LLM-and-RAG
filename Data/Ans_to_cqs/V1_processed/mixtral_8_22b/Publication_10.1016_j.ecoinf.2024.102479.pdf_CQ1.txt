The paper by K. Ayushi et al. does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the context that remote sensing data, specifically Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, has been employed for gathering spatial information related to the study area. This is evident from Fig. 2b, which shows the distribution of sampling plots with their above-ground biomass values in the BRT tiger reserve, collected on 25 November 2020 using Sentinel 2 false color composite near-infrared, red, and green bands. Additionally, the authors have made use of the Global Wood Density (WD) database (Chave et al., 2009; Zanne et al., 2009) to calculate WD values.

Moreover, the reference list includes several sources relevant to remote sensing and machine learning techniques applied to ecology and geospatial analysis. These include papers discussing the exploitation of Sentinel-2 data (Gascon et al., 2017), soil grid databases (Hengl et al., 2017), and the application of neural networks (Fritsch et al., 2019). While these resources do not directly address the methodologies for collecting raw data, they provide insights into how such data might be processed and analyzed within the context of the research.
