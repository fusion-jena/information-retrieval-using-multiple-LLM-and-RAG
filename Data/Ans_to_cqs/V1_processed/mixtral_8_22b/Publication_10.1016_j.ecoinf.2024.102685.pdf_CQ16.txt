The text does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions that multiple runs with different numbers of trees were performed, suggesting that some form of iterative process or convergence criterion might have been employed. Additionally, the use of cross-validation techniques indicates that model performance was evaluated during training. Nevertheless, without further details, we cannot definitively state what exact criteria were used to decide when training should be stopped.
