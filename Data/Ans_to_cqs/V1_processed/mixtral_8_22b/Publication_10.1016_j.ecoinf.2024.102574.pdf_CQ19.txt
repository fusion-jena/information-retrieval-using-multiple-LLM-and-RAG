The papers cited do not explicitly mention which specific deep learning framework was used to develop their respective models. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively state whether they used TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other deep learning framework. It should also be noted that while some of the studies mentioned use machine learning techniques, not all of them necessarily employ deep learning methodologies.
