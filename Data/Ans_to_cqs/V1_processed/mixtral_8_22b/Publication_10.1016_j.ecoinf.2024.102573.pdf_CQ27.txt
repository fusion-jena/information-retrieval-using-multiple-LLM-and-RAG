Unfortunately, there isn't enough context provided to accurately determine what specific process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, typically, after training a deep learning model, the next steps involve saving or serializing the model, selecting a platform for deployment, and then integrating the saved model into the chosen platform. This often involves converting the serialized model into a format compatible with the selected platform. After integration, testing should be performed to ensure the deployed model functions correctly and provides accurate predictions.
