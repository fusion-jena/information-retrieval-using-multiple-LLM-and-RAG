Based on the given information, it can be inferred that the deep learning pipeline primarily uses image data format. The context mentions the use of ImageNet dataset, which consists of millions of labeled images belonging to thousands of categories. Additionally, the discussion revolves around image processing techniques like mean centering and rescaling, and the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN), which are typically employed for image analysis tasks. However, there is no explicit mention of other data formats like audio, video, or CSV being utilized in the deep learning pipeline.
