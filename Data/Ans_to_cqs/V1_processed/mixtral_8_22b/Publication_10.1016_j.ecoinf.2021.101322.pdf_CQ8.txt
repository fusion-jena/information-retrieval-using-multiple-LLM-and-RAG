The code repository of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, it does provide some clues about where the code might be located. It mentions that the CNN was implemented using the Keras and TensorFlow software packages in Python, and that computation was performed using CUDA version 9.1 and CuDNN with Nvidia P100 accelerator cards. Additionally, it states that a Keras implementation of EfficientNet-B4 called EfficientNet V1.1.0 was used, and that the pre-trained weights used for transfer learning were available through its API. Based on these details, one possible location for the code repository could be the GitHub page for EfficientNet V1.1.0, which can be found at <https://github.com/qubvel/efficientnet>. However, without more specific information, it cannot be confirmed whether this is indeed the correct repository.
