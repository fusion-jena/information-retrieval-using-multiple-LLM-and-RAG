After the model training, the experimental setup involves evaluating the models using a test dataset. An image is divided into patches, and the important patches are selected using a specific approach. Each patch is then classified by the model, and the weighted majority voting technique is applied to predict the overall class label of the image based on these individual predictions.

The evaluation process does not explicitly mention any postprocessing steps like saliency maps or confusion matrices. However, it implies that metrics calculation might be part of the evaluation since the study aims to assess the performance of the models. These metrics could include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., but the exact metrics used are not specified in the given context.

Therefore, while the postprocessing steps are not clearly outlined in the provided information, one can infer that some form of metrics calculation would likely take place during the evaluation phase to measure the effectiveness of the deep learning models.
