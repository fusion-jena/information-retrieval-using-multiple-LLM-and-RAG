Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the training set must have its data normalized and standardized before fitting into the network. It also states that the purpose of using a batch size of 32 was to not exceed the memory limit and to make full use of computer resources. This suggests that the dataset could potentially be large or complex enough to require careful management of computational resources. Additionally, the context discusses the application of the MU-NET deep learning method for semantic segmentation of images to construct soil salinity maps. Therefore, it can be inferred that the dataset likely consists of remote sensing images related to soil salinity. Unfortunately, without more explicit information about the dataset, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer regarding which specific datasets were used in the deep learning pipeline.
