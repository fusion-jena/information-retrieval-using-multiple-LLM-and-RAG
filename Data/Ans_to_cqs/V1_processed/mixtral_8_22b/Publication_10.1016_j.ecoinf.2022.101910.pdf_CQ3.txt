The text does not provide specific information on the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for BirdNET. However, it mentions that BirdNET uses a deep neural network to automatically detect and classify bird vocalizations from sound recordings. This suggests that the data annotation process likely involves labeling audio files with the corresponding bird species. It is possible that this could involve some form of manual annotation, where experts listen to the audio files and assign labels based on their knowledge of bird vocalizations. Alternatively, it could involve semi-automatic methods, where machine learning algorithms are trained to recognize patterns in the audio data and generate labels accordingly. Without more detailed information about the specific techniques used, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this question.
