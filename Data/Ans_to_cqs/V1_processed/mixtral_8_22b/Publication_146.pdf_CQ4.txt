The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, or color space transformations can be applied during image preprocessing to increase the amount of available training data and improve the robustness of the trained models. However, without explicit information from the sources cited, it cannot be confirmed whether these particular techniques were employed in this case.
