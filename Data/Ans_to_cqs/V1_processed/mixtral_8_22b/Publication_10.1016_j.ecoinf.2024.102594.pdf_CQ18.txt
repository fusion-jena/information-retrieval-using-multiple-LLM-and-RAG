The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is ReduceLROnPlateau. This means that if the validation loss value does not decrease after five consecutive epochs, the learning rate will be halved. Additionally, if there is no decrease in the validation loss value after ten consecutive epochs, the training process will be terminated. All model training and inference are executed on a GeForce RTX 3070 GPU.
