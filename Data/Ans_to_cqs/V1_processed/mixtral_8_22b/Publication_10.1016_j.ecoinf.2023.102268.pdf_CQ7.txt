The labeled dataset was split 70/30 into training and testing datasets. For model selection and parameter optimization, 50% of the training data were held out for validation. This means that the initial 70% of the labeled dataset was further divided into two parts - 50% for actual training and 50% for validation. The remaining 30% of the labeled dataset was used for testing the performance of the final model.
