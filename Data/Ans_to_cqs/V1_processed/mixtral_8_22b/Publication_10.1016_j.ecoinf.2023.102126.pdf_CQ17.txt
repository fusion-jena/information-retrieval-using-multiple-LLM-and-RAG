Unfortunately, I cannot provide a helpful answer to your query as the given pieces of context do not contain any information about regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. Regularization methods like dropout and L2 regularization are techniques used during training to reduce overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function or randomly dropping out neurons. However, without more specific details related to the context, I am unable to give a detailed response.
