The given context does not explicitly mention any specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it provides several sources of geospatial data that could potentially be used in a deep learning model for analyzing ecological carbon sink risk zones. These include:

1. Resource Environment Science and Data Research Center Data Center - <https://www.resdc.cn>
2. OpenStreetMap - <https://www.openstreetmap.org>
3. Geospatial Data Cloud - <http://www.gscloud.cn/>
4. National Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Scientific - <http://data.tpdc.ac.cn>
5. Chinese Research Data Services Platform - <http://www.cnrds.com>

These resources offer various types of geospatial data, including temperature, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), gross domestic product (GDP), population, food production, and other socio-economic factors. While these datasets can be useful for training machine learning models, they do not directly correspond to well-known image classification datasets commonly used in deep learning pipelines, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
