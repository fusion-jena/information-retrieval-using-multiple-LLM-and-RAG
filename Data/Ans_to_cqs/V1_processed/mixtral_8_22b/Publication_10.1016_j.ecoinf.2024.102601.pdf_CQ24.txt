The text does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or managing random seed values. However, it discusses the use of RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization in machine learning algorithms like Random Forests. These techniques can help mitigate some aspects of randomness in the modeling process.

RandomizedSearchCV uses a probabilistic approach to explore the hyperparameter space, sampling from specified distributions to generate a set of candidate configurations. This allows for efficient navigation through large hyperparameter spaces, especially when there is uncertainty about the optimal values.

GridSearchCV, on the other hand, performs an exhaustive search over a predefined grid of hyperparameter values. By evaluating all combinations within this grid, GridSearchCV guarantees finding the optimal parameter configuration.

While these methods do not directly address randomness related to random seeds, they contribute to reducing variability in model performance due to suboptimal hyperparameters. To manage randomness associated with random seeds, common practices include setting fixed seed values for reproducibility or averaging results across multiple runs with different seed values to account for variance.
