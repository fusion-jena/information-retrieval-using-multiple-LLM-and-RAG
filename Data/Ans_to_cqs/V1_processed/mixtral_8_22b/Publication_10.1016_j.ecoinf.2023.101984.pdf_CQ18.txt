Based on the given context, it appears that the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using a maximum number of iterations with the subsample run type and a 30 random test percentage. Additionally, the table presented suggests that the MaxEnt model's output was analyzed by estimating the relative contributions of the environmental and territorial variables to the model. This analysis includes calculating the percentage contribution and permutation importance for each variable. The percentage contribution determines the jackknife, where the increase in regularized gain is added to the contribution of the corresponding variable in each iteration of the training algorithm. On the other hand, permutation importance shows the values of that variable on training presence and background data, which are randomly permuted. The model is then reevaluated on the permuted data, and the resulting drop in training AUC is shown, normalized to percentages. Therefore, these strategies help monitor the model performance during training by evaluating its accuracy and identifying important variables contributing to the model's predictions.
