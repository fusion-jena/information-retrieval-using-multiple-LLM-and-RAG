Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the optimizer. However, it can be inferred that the authors used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and fine-tuned several state-of-the-art CNN architectures like VGG, Inception, and ResNet. They also mentioned evaluating the performance of these networks using training datasets and selecting the most effective model. Additionally, they discussed the use of learning curves to monitor the training loss and convergence of the networks. But without explicit details regarding the hyperparameters, it is impossible to determine the exact settings used in the deep learning model.
