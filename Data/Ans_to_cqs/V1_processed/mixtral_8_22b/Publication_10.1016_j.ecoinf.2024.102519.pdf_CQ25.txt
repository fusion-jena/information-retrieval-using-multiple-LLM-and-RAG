Based on the given information, it is not explicitly stated what the purpose of the deep learning model is. However, we can infer that the deep learning model might be used for one or more of the following purposes:

1. Classification: Deep learning models can be used to classify different types of objects or patterns within the input data. For example, they could be used to identify different types of vegetation or land cover using satellite imagery.

2. Segmentation: These models can also be used to segment images into different regions or objects. This could involve separating different types of terrain or identifying areas affected by natural disasters such as floods or wildfires.

3. Detection: Deep learning models can be trained to detect specific features or anomalies within the input data. In ecology, this could include detecting changes in animal populations over time or identifying invasive species.

Without further context, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer regarding the purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the text.
