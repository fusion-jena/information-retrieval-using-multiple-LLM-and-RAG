Based on the given information, it appears that the optimal parameters for discretizing continuous data in the study were selected using the "optidisc" function of the "GD" package in RStudio 4.2.2. However, there is no explicit mention of how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, such as through grid search or random search. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this specific query based solely on the provided context.
