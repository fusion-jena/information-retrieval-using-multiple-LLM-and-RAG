The pipeline uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as its deep learning model. CNNs are a type of deep learning algorithm that belongs to the class of Deep Learning Algorithms (DLAs). They are specifically designed to process grid-like topology data such as images. In the case of species identification, the training phase is supervised, meaning that the classes to be identified are pre-defined by human experts while the parameters of the classifier are automatically optimized to accurately classify a 'training' database. CNNs consist of neurons organized in layers, with each neuron computing an operation on the input data and transferring the extracted information to the neurons of the next layer. The specificity of CNNs is their ability to build a descriptor for the input image data and the classifier simultaneously, ensuring they are both optimized for each other.
