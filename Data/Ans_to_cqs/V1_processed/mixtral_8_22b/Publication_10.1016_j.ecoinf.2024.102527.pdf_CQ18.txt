To monitor the model performance during training, the authors trained their models on the training sets and tracked the model training process on the validation set. They stopped the training process when the loss value of the model on the validation set no longer decreased. Afterward, they tested the model performance on the test set. This approach allowed them to ensure that the model did not overfit the training data and could generalize well to unseen data.
