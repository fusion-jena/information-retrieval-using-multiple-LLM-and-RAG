Two main datasets were utilized in the deep learning pipeline described in the given text. These include the custom-collected FishInTurbidWater dataset and the widely recognized ImageNet dataset.

The FishInTurbidWater dataset was specifically gathered and weakly labeled to create the first weakly-supervised fish dataset in turbid water environments. This dataset served as the foundation for developing two innovative deep learning networks aimed at reducing model deployment times while maintaining high accuracy levels.

On the other hand, the ImageNet dataset played a crucial role in the transfer learning process. It consists of approximately fourteen million images, meticulously hand-annotated with bounding boxes to identify the presence and location of specific objects within each image. In this study, ImageNet was employed to pre-train two popular deep neural networks (DNNs): EfficientNet and Vision Transformer (ViT). Both models are renowned for their exceptional capacity in image classification tasks, all while demanding fewer computational resources compared to alternative DNNs.
