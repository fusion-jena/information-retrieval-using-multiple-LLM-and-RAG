Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available in the given context to determine the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. Typically, the dataset is divided randomly or using stratified sampling techniques to ensure that all classes are represented proportionally in each subset. However, without explicit details about the methodology employed in this particular case, it would not be possible to provide a definitive answer.
