The performance of the deep learning model, specifically ResNet50, is evaluated using two primary metrics: Top1 accuracy and Top5 accuracy. Top1 accuracy measures how often the correct label is the highest probability label, while Top5 accuracy measures how often the correct label is among the five labels with the highest probability. These metrics are used to compare the performance of ResNet50 with the PlantNet tool across three different datasets.
