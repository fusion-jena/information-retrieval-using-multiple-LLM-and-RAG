The authors do not explicitly discuss strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, they mention employing Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA), which is a statistical technique used to account for model uncertainty when multiple models are available. BMA combines the strengths of various models by averaging their predictions, weighted by each model's posterior probability. By incorporating BMA into their analysis, the researchers may be able to mitigate some of the effects of randomness introduced by factors like random seed values. Additionally, the use of ensemble methods or cross-validation techniques might also help manage randomness in the deep learning pipeline, but these specific strategies are not mentioned in the given context.
