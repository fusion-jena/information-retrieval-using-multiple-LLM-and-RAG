To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, various strategies can be employed. One common approach is to use fixed random seeds during development and experimentation. This ensures reproducibility of results and allows for easier debugging and comparison of different models or configurations. However, once a satisfactory configuration has been found, it may be beneficial to introduce some randomness back into the system, such as through random initialization of weights or shuffling of input data, to improve generalization performance. Another strategy is to perform multiple runs with different random seeds and average the results, which can help reduce variability due to randomness. Additionally, techniques like dropout regularization and batch normalization can also help mitigate the effects of randomness in deep learning pipelines.

I apologize, but there doesn't seem to be any information related to handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline within the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer based on the provided text.
