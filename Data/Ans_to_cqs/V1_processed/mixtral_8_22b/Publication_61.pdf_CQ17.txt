Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any specific regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, the authors discuss potential ways to avoid overfitting in their approach. They suggest that making the current convolutional neural network (CNN) deeper might lead to memorizing the dataset due to the model capacity, resulting in overfitting. Instead, they propose including more examples in the dataset under different conditions, such as varying daylight conditions or different year seasons. By doing so, they aim to improve the current accuracy without increasing the risk of overfitting.

Regularization methods like dropout and L2 regularization are commonly used to prevent overfitting in deep learning models. Dropout randomly sets a fraction of input units to 0 at each update during training time, effectively preventing complex co-adaptations between neurons. On the other hand, L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, discouraging large weights and promoting simpler models. These methods can help reduce overfitting by introducing noise into the training process or limiting the complexity of the learned representations.

However, based solely on the provided context, it cannot be determined whether these specific regularization methods were employed in the described deep learning pipeline.
