To ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the model was trained on a diverse dataset consisting of 653 annotated images. To further evaluate its performance, it was tested on an independent dataset comprising 708 full-scale herbarium scans from the Herbarium Senckenbergianum (FR), featuring a different set of species and geographical origins. This approach allowed for assessing the model's ability to handle variations in both species and environmental conditions.

Secondly, transfer learning was employed to initialize the model weights using pre-trained models from the ImageNet dataset. This technique leverages the knowledge gained from previous tasks to improve the performance on new tasks, thereby enhancing the model's adaptability across various domains. By utilizing this strategy, the researchers aimed to capitalize on the generic features learned by the initial layers of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) while fine-tuning the deeper layers specifically for the herbarium scan dataset.

Lastly, although not explicitly mentioned in the given context, cross-validation or stratified splitting could potentially have been utilized to validate the model's performance further. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into k subsets, training the model on k-1 subsets, and testing it on the remaining subset. This process is repeated k times, each time with a different subset serving as the test set. On the other hand, stratified splitting ensures that the distribution of classes remains consistent between the training and validation sets. These techniques help prevent overfitting and provide a more robust evaluation of the model's performance. However, without explicit confirmation, we cannot definitively state whether they were applied in this case.
