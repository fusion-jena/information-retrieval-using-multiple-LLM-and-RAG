The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a grid search approach. This involves testing various combinations of hyperparameter values to find the optimal configuration that results in the highest accuracy or lowest loss function. The employed machine learning models include Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Decision Tree (DT), and Random Forest (RF). Each learning model undergoes a grid search to achieve optimal parameter tuning. For example, in SVR, the degree, kernel, epsilon, and gamma are adjusted to reach the highest accuracy. Similarly, in RF, grid search is applied to determine the best hyperparameters combination. Additionally, the Tree Parzen Estimator (TPE) method from the Hyperopt package is also utilized for parameter finding and optimization.
