In the context of deep learning pipelines, there are several regularization methods used to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise along with underlying patterns, leading to poor generalization performance on new, unseen data. Regularization techniques help mitigate this issue by adding constraints or penalties to the model during training. Two commonly used regularization methods are Dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are temporarily removed ("dropped out") from the neural network during each iteration of training. By doing so, the network cannot rely solely on any single feature or group of features, promoting distributed representations and reducing overfitting. The rate of dropped neurons can be adjusted as a hyperparameter.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the sum of squared weights in the model. This encourages smaller weights, effectively limiting the complexity of the learned functions and preventing overfitting. The strength of the penalty can be controlled using a hyperparameter called the regularization parameter.

Other regularization methods include L1 regularization, early stopping, and batch normalization. L1 regularization promotes sparse solutions by penalizing the absolute size of the weights, while early stopping halts training once validation error starts increasing. Batch normalization standardizes inputs within mini-batches, improving convergence speed and stability. These techniques collectively contribute to building robust deep learning models capable of handling diverse datasets without succumbing to overfitting.
