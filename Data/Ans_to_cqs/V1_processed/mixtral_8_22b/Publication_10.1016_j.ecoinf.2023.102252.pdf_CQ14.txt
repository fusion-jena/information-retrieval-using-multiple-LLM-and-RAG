The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using the Shuffle Complex Evolution method. This method is employed to fit parameters by maximizing the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) as the objective function. An NSE of 1 indicates that the model fits the given data exactly, while a value less than 0 indicates that the model performs worse than using the sample mean as a predictor. Additionally, minimizing the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as the objective function can be used and will return comparable results to NSE, as both are based on the sum of squared residuals. It is important to note that when using RMSE as the objective function and as a metric to evaluate model performance, the statistic must be viewed in the context of the magnitude of model outputs.
