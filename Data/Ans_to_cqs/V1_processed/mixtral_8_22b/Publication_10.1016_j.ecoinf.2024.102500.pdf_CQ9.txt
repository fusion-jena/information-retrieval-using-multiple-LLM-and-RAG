The given context does not provide any specific information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that the dataset was used for fivefold cross-validation and that it was split into five equal-sized folds. However, there is no mention of where this dataset can be accessed or downloaded from. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this query based on the given context.
