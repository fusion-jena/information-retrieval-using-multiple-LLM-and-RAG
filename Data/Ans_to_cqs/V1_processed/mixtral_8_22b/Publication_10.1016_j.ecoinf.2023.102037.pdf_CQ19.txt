Based on the given information, it is not explicitly stated which specific deep learning framework was used to build the model. However, there are some clues that suggest possible frameworks. For instance, the mention of using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as the model's optimizer and applying default data augmentation techniques of YOLOv5 indicate that the model might have been built using a popular object detection framework such as Darknet or PyTorch, both of which support YOLOv5. Additionally, the use of an NVIDIA GPU suggests that the model could be utilizing CUDA for accelerating computations, which is supported by many deep learning frameworks including TensorFlow and PyTorch. Therefore, without further explicit information, we cannot definitively determine which framework was used but can infer that it may be one of these popular deep learning frameworks.
