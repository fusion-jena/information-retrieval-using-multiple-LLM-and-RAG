Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to provide the exact data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the study uses datasets of various sizes related to different types of land covers such as pasture grass, corn, soybeans, potatoes, grasslands, forests, open shrublands, barren vegetation, sawgrass, citrus orchards, and spontaneous flora. These datasets might have been collected from various sources, including weather stations, micro-meteorological data, and other relevant sources. It would be best to refer to the original research papers mentioned in the context, such as Mosre et al. (2021), Granata et al. (2020), Zhang et al. (2021), Wang et al. (2023), Izadifar et al. (2010), and Hao et al. (2022), to find more details about the data repositories used in their respective studies.
