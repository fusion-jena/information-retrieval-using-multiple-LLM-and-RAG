Based on the provided information, there is no direct mention of the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it can be inferred that the authors used various metrics such as Somersâ€™ D, True Skill Statistic, and continuous Boyce index to evaluate the performance of their models. These metrics were likely used to compare different covariate selection procedures and modeling algorithms. Additionally, the authors mentioned using Wilcoxon tests to assess statistical significance in differences between methods. Therefore, while the exact monitoring strategy is not explicitly stated, it appears that the authors employed multiple evaluation metrics and statistical testing to ensure the quality of their models.
