Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, such as through methods like grid search or random search. However, it can be inferred from the context that various machine learning algorithms were tested to generate predictive models, including Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), Random Forest (RF), Flexible Discriminant Analysis (FDA), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Generalized Boosting regression Model (GBM), and Maximum-Entropy learning (MAXENT). These algorithms have their own ways of handling hyperparameter optimization, but the exact methods used in this case are not mentioned in the provided context.
