The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is not explicitly stated, however, we can infer that its primary function is likely related to regression analysis. Four methods are mentioned for modeling forest Above Ground Biomass (AGB): AdaBoost, Random Decision Forest (RF), Multilayer Neural Network (NET), and Bayesian Ridge Regression (Bayes). These methods suggest that the deep learning model is being used for predictive or analytical purposes rather than tasks such as image classification, segmentation, or object detection. Furthermore, the use of terms like'model tuning', 'hyperparameters', and 'optimal settings' indicate that these models are being employed for regression analysis. Therefore, while the specific purpose isn't directly stated, it can be reasonably assumed that the deep learning model is being used for regression analysis to estimate forest AGB.
