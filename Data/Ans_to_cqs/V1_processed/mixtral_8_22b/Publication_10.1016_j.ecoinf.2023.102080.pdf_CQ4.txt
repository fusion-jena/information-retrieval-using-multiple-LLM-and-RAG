Based on the given context, there is no mention of any specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotation, scaling, etc. The context primarily discusses the steps involved in selecting covariates for modeling purposes, specifically focusing on two main steps - Step A (collinearity filtering) and Step B (model-specific embedding). These steps involve various parameters like window size, category levels, algorithms, target number of covariates, maximum possible number of covariates, number of cores for parallel operations, correlation coefficient threshold, and more. However, these do not directly relate to data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine what data augmentation techniques are applied in this case.
