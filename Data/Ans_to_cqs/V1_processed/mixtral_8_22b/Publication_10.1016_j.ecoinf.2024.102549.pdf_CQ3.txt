The given context does not provide specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge, some common data annotation techniques used in deep learning include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and landmark annotation. These techniques help label or tag datasets with meaningful metadata, allowing algorithms to learn from them effectively. For example, bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangles around objects within images, while instance segmentation requires outlining each object individually. The choice of technique depends on the type of dataset and the problem being solved.
