The research papers mentioned primarily use images as their input format for the deep learning pipelines. Specifically, they utilize high-resolution images of various plant leaves for classification purposes. These images undergo several preprocessing steps such as resizing, segmentation, and augmentation before being fed into the deep learning models like CNN, ResNet-50, or VGG-16. While other data formats like audio, video, or CSV files may be relevant for different applications, these specific studies only mention the usage of image data.
