The provided context does not directly discuss specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it mentions two important aspects related to data preparation: data denoising and data annotation. These steps can help improve the overall quality of the input data and ensure accurate labeling, which indirectly contributes to reducing potential biases in the dataset.

Data denoising involves removing unwanted signals or noise from the whale sound recordings, which could be caused by various environmental factors or human activities. By applying filtering and denoising techniques, the researchers aim to improve the signal quality and ensure that the subsequent feature extraction process is more reliable. Although this step doesn't specifically target data bias, it helps maintain the integrity of the original information contained within the audio samples.

On the other hand, data annotation refers to the process of manually assigning labels or tags to each audio clip based on its content. In this case, the authors might have labeled their datasets according to different categories, such as species identification, vocalization type, or behavioral context. Proper data annotation ensures that the model receives consistent and accurate feedback during the training phase, ultimately leading to better performance and reduced bias.

While these methods do not explicitly tackle data bias issues like those mentioned in the query, they play crucial roles in preparing high-quality datasets for deep learning applications. To further mitigate any potential biases, one could consider employing additional strategies such as stratified sampling, oversampling underrepresented classes, or collecting diverse data from multiple sources.
