Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the provided context to determine the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). Typically, this process involves splitting the dataset into three subsets: training, testing, and validation sets. However, without further details about the specific implementation or methodology used in this case, it's not possible to provide a definitive answer.
