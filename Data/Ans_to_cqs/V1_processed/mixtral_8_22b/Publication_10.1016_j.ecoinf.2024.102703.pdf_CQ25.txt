The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the model is being used for regression or prediction purposes. Specifically, the model is designed to predict the Total Suspended Solids Index (TSI) based on two inputs: aCDOM(254) and Fn(355). This is evident from the fact that the model comprises a single neuron in both the intermediate and output layers, which correspond to the predictor (TSI). Additionally, the performance of the model is evaluated using metrics commonly used for regression tasks, namely the coefficient of determination (R^2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE). Therefore, it can be concluded that the purpose of this deep learning model is to predict the TSI based on the given inputs.
