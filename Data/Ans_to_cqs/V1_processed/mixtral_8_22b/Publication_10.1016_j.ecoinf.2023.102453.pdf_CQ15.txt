While the given context does not explicitly mention specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), it does discuss various aspects of optimizing deep learning pipelines.

Hyperparameter optimization is one crucial aspect mentioned in the context. This involves selecting optimal values for hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and dropout, among others. These hyperparameters significantly impact the performance of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs).

Transfer learning is another optimization technique discussed in the context. It leverages pre-trained models to reduce training time and improve performance, particularly when dealing with smaller datasets. Three methods of transfer learning were employed: feature extraction, fine-tuning with some layers trained, and fine-tuning with all layers trained. The latter method showed improved classification performance.

Progressive learning was also utilized to enhance the performance of the EfficientNetV2B0 model by adapting regularization to image size. Additionally, neural architecture search (NAS) was employed for developing the EfficientNetV2B0 model, focusing on optimizing parameter efficiency and training speed.

In summary, while explicit optimization techniques like SGD or Adam are not directly mentioned, the context highlights several optimization strategies integral to deep learning pipelines. These include hyperparameter optimization, transfer learning, progressive learning, and NAS.
