The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it can be inferred that some common postprocessing steps might have been employed due to their relevance in machine learning models like Random Forest (RF). These may include metrics calculation such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or area under the curve (AUC) to evaluate the performance of the trained model. Additionally, confusion matrices could also be generated to visualize the performance of the model. It should be noted that these are assumptions based on standard practices in machine learning and are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
