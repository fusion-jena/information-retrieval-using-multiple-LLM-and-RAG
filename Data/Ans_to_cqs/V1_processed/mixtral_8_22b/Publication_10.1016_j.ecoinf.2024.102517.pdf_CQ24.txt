The paper does not explicitly discuss strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it mentions that during the training phase, the entire training set was presented in a random order, with one noisy bird sound signal per iteration. This suggests that some level of randomness was introduced into the model training process. Additionally, the use of the Adam optimizer, which incorporates momentum and adaptive learning rates, could also contribute to handling randomness indirectly by adjusting the learning rate dynamically based on previous iterations. Nevertheless, specific strategies for controlling or managing randomness in the deep learning pipeline are not discussed in this study.
