The study primarily uses MCD43A4 V6.1 data for satellite path h27v06, spanning October 29, 2022, to December 20, 2022. These data were obtained from the Google Earth Engine platform and underwent pre-processing steps such as mosaicking and clipping. The data access link is <https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/MODIS_061_MCD43A4>.

While this information does not explicitly mention any commonly known datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, it provides details about the specific dataset used in the study. The MCD43A4 V6.1 data is part of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products, which provide various land surface reflectance data.

Therefore, the primary dataset used in the deep learning pipeline appears to be the MCD43A4 V6.1 data, specifically for satellite path h27v06 during the mentioned time frame.
