The text does not provide explicit information about the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions several types of data sources such as climate data, digital elevation models, hydrogeological maps, vector data on roads and hunting, and land cover maps. These data could potentially be in various formats like CSV, shapefiles, geotiffs, etc. Additionally, the text refers to converting certain values into raster format, which suggests the use of raster data. Without more detailed information, it cannot be definitively stated what exact data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline.
