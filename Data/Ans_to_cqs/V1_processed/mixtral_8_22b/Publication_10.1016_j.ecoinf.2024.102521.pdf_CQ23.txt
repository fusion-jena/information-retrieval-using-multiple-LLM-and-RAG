The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model used for bulk arthropod abundance, biomass, and diversity estimation. However, it can be inferred from the context that the authors have considered the importance of diverse datasets and expert labeling for improving the accuracy and applicability of their models.

In the context, there is a reference to a paper titled "Bulk arthropod abundance, biomass, and diversity estimation using deep learning for computer vision" published in Methods in Ecology and Evolution in 2022. This suggests that the authors may have employed deep learning techniques for image analysis and classification tasks related to arthropods. Additionally, the context mentions the use of a modular classification scheme with custom-made AI-based classification models, which implies that the authors have developed multiple specialized models tailored to different tasks or species.

While the context does not provide explicit details about the methods used to ensure the generalizability of these models, some common practices in machine learning include using diverse datasets, employing cross-validation techniques, and performing stratified sampling during the training process. These approaches help prevent overfitting and improve the ability of the models to perform well on unseen data. Given the emphasis on expert labeling and the creation of task-specific classifiers mentioned in the context, it is reasonable to assume that the authors might have incorporated similar strategies to enhance the robustness and reliability of their deep learning models.
