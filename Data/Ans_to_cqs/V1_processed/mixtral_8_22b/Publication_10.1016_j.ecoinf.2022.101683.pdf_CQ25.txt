The text does not provide explicit information about the purpose of the deep learning model. However, it mentions several evaluation metrics such as AUC, TPR, TSS, Kappa, and Omission, which are commonly used in binary classification tasks. Therefore, it can be inferred that the deep learning model might have been developed for a classification task, possibly predicting the presence or absence of a certain species within a given geographical area.
