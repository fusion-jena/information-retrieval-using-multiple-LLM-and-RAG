Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about any postprocessing steps involved after the model training. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based solely on the provided text. However, common postprocessing steps include evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves, and confusion matrices. Additionally, techniques like saliency maps can be used to visualize and understand the features contributing most significantly to the model's predictions.
