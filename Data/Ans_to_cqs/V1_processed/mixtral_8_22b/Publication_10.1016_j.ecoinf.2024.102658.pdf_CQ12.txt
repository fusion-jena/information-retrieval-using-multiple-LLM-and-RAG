Based on the given information, it appears that no specific type of deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers is explicitly mentioned as part of the pipeline. Instead, the paper discusses using Random Forest, a type of ensemble learning algorithm, as well as Bayesian Logistic Regression and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) Logistic Regression, and Bayesian Generalized Additive Models (GAM). Therefore, based solely on the provided context, we cannot determine what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline.
