To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, a diverse dataset was utilized, consisting of multiple classes such as P. australis, S. salsa, Tidal flat, Aquatic environment, Paddy field, Aquaculture pond, Dryland, Forested region, and Developed land. This diversity helps prevent overfitting and improves the model's ability to perform well on unseen data. Secondly, stratified splitting was employed during the creation of training and validation sets. This method ensures that each class has approximately the same proportion of instances in both the training and validation sets, which further prevents bias towards any particular class. Lastly, cross-validation was applied using a five-fold strategy. This technique involves dividing the dataset into five equal parts, where four parts are used for training and one part for validation. This process is then repeated five times, ensuring that every subset serves as the validation set once. Cross-validation provides a more robust estimate of the model's performance and reduces the risk of overfitting or underfitting.
