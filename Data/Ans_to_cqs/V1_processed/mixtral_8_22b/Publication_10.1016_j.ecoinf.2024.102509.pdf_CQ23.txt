The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some indications that suggest efforts towards achieving this goal.

Firstly, the use of diverse datasets is implied when mentioning the combination of multiple data sources to improve overall prediction accuracy. This suggests that the model was trained on varied inputs, which could contribute to its ability to generalize better.

Secondly, the text mentions that the accuracy of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN)'s training process depends on the quality and quantity of the sample dataset. This implies that care was taken to ensure the dataset used for training was robust and comprehensive.

Thirdly, the process of determining the number of hidden layers and neurons through trial and error indicates an attempt to optimize the network's structure. This optimization process could potentially lead to a more generalizable model.

Lastly, the use of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for analyzing the relative effectiveness of the model suggests that some form of validation was performed. While the text does not explicitly state whether cross-validation or stratified splitting techniques were employed, these are common practices in machine learning to assess a model's performance and generalization capabilities.

Therefore, while the text does not directly address the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, it provides hints that such considerations were likely part of the development process.
