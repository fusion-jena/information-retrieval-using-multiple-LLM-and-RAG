Several metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models in this study. These include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Additionally, a confusion matrix is utilized to provide detailed information about the model's performance and prediction errors.

Accuracy measures the proportion of correctly classified images out of the total number of images, providing a general overview of the model's performance. Precision represents the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positive observations. Recall, or sensitivity, indicates the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all actual positive observations. The F1 score combines both precision and recall by taking their harmonic mean, offering a more balanced evaluation of the model's performance. Lastly, the confusion matrix presents a table with true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative counts, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the model's strengths and weaknesses.
