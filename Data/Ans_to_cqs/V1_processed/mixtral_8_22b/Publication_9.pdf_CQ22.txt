The study uses four common image segmentation evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the deep learning model: pixel accuracy (PxAcc), mean accuracy (MeanAcc), mean intersection over union (MeanIoU), and frequency-weighted intersection over union (FreqIoU). These metrics are calculated using equations 1 through 4, respectively. The results show that there is a significant difference among these metrics, with FreqIoU being significantly lower than MeanAcc and PxAcc, while MeanAcc is significantly higher than MeanIoU and PxAcc. Furthermore, MeanIoU is significantly lower than PxAcc. These findings suggest that different metrics may provide varying insights into the performance of the deep learning model.
