The research paper primarily focuses on using high-resolution topographic data from airborne laser scanning (ALS) and spectral information from PlanetScope imagery to assess soil moisture in reclaimed mining areas. Therefore, the primary method for collecting raw data in this case involves utilizing remote sensing techniques like ALS and satellite imagery.

Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS): This technique uses LiDAR technology mounted on aircraft or drones to collect highly accurate elevation data. It provides detailed information about terrain features, including slopes, aspects, and vegetation cover. In this study, ALS data were acquired on April 18, 2020, with a mean height error of 0.2 meters and 25 points per square meter.

PlanetScope Imagery: PlanetScope satellites provide daily global coverage of multispectral images with a spatial resolution of around three to five meters. These images can be used to extract various spectral indices related to vegetation health and water content. By combining these spectral indices with topographical data obtained through ALS, researchers aim to enhance the accuracy of volumetric water content predictions in post-mining landscapes.

While not explicitly mentioned in the given context, it should also be noted that additional sources of raw data may include ground truth measurements, weather data, and historical records. Ground truth measurements involve physically measuring variables such as soil moisture levels at specific locations within the study area. Weather data can help account for atmospheric conditions affecting evapotranspiration rates and overall water availability. Historical records might provide insights into past land use practices and their impact on current soil moisture patterns.
