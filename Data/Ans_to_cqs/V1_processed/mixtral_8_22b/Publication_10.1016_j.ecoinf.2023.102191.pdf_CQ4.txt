The given context does not provide information regarding the application of any data augmentation techniques in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based solely on this context. However, common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, and shearing. These methods help increase the size of training datasets and improve model performance.
