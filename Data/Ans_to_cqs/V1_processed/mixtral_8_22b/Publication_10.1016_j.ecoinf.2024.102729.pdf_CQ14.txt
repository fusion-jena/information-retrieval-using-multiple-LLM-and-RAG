Based on the given context, it appears that the optimization of the hyperparameters for the Random Forest (RF) model was done by selecting the number of trees as the hyperparameter. However, the specific method used for optimizing this hyperparameter, such as grid search or random search, is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. Therefore, based solely on the given context, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the exact method used for hyperparameter optimization.
