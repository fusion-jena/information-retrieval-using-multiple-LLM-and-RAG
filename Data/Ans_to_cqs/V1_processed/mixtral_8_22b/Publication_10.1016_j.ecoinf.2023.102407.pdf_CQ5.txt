The given context does not provide information about specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions using BIOCLIM variables like Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter, Mean Temperature of Driest Quarter, Annual Precipitation, etc. These variables suggest that the dataset might be related to climate or environmental studies. The context also discusses sampling 10% and 30% of the remaining dataset for validation and testing purposes, but no explicit mention is made regarding the initial dataset used. Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot determine which specific datasets were used in the deep learning pipeline.
