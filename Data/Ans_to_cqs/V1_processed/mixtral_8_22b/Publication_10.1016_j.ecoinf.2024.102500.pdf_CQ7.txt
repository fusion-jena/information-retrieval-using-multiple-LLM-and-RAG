The given context does not explicitly mention the splitting criteria for deep learning model training, but it provides information about the splitting method used for machine learning models. In this case, the dataset is divided into five equal-sized folds using fivefold cross-validation. This means that the dataset is randomly partitioned into five subsets, where each subset serves as the testing set once while the remaining four subsets form the training set. This process is repeated five times, ensuring that every observation from the original dataset has been used exactly once for validation. However, it should be noted that the context focuses on hyperparameter tuning and model performance rather than specifying the exact proportions for train, test, and validation sets typically found in deep learning applications.
