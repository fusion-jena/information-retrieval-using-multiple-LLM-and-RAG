The given context does not provide information about specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on common practices in deep learning, some popular data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, zooming, and color space transformations. These techniques help increase the amount of available training data by creating modified versions of the original images, thereby improving the model's ability to generalize and reducing overfitting.
