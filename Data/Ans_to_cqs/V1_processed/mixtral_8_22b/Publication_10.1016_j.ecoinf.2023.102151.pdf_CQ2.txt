The given context does not provide specific details about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the chosen approach often depends on the target audience and the format of the source data. It also refers to a broader survey of soil visualization within the general environmental and ecological context, where the results of such studies are often code libraries in conventional data science programming languages like Python or R. Additionally, it discusses the use of resources such as Crop-CASMA for US soil moisture data, which suggests that the data might be in a structured format like CSV or similar. But without explicit mention of the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, it cannot be definitively stated what those formats are.
