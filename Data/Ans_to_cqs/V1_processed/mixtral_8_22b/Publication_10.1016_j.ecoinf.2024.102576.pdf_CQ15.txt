Based on the given context, it appears that the focus is primarily on the application of deep learning models, specifically the U-Net model, for land-cover classification and extraction of ecological information. While the context does not explicitly mention any specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), these are commonly used techniques in training deep learning models like U-Net.

Optimization techniques are essential in deep learning pipelines to minimize the loss function during the training process. They help adjust the weights and biases of the model to improve its accuracy. Both SGD and Adam are popular choices due to their efficiency and effectiveness.

SGD updates the parameters of the model by computing the gradient of the cost function with respect to the parameters. It uses a subset of the training data to compute the gradient, making it computationally efficient when dealing with large datasets.

On the other hand, Adam combines the benefits of two other extensions of SGD: Adaptive Gradient Algorithm (AdaGrad) and Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp). Adam computes adaptive learning rates for different parameters from estimates of first and second moments of the gradients.

However, without explicit mention in the provided context, it cannot be definitively stated which optimization technique was used in this particular case. Therefore, further research or additional context would be required to provide a more precise answer.
