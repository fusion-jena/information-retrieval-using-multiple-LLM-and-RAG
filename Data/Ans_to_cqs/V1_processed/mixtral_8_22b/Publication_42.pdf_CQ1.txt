The method utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline involves capturing sequences of images during specific periods of observation. Individual insects are then selected from these captured sequences to create a dataset. Different orientations of the same individual are included to ensure sufficient samples for each class. For instance, in the given context, images from three survey nights (30 August to 2 September 2019) were used to test the algorithm on a mostly unknown data material. It can be inferred that the primary method for gathering raw data is through conducting surveys or observations using image capture devices like cameras or sensors. Public datasets do not seem to have been explicitly mentioned as sources of raw data in the provided context.
