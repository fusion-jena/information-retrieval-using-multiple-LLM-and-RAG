The text does not provide explicit information about how the trained deep learning model was deployed after completion of the training phase. However, based on common practices in machine learning projects, we can infer that the deployment process likely involved some form of model serialization, where the trained model was saved into a file format that can be loaded later for making predictions. This serialized model would then be integrated into a platform or application for real-world usage. Since the authors mentioned using Google Colaboratory (Colab), which provides a Jupyter Notebook environment, they might have utilized TensorFlow or PyTorch libraries to save and load models. Additionally, they could have chosen cloud platforms like AWS SageMaker, Azure Machine Learning Studio, or Google Cloud AI Platform for hosting and managing the deployed model. Nevertheless, without specific details regarding the deployment process, these assumptions remain speculative.
