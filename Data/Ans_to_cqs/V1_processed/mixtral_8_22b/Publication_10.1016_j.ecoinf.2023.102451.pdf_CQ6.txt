Before training a deep learning model such as EMViT-Net, some preprocessing steps are performed to improve the quality and consistency of the input data. These steps include data augmentation and normalization. Data augmentation involves creating new samples by applying various transformations to existing ones, such as rotation, flipping, zooming, or cropping. This helps increase the size and diversity of the training dataset, making it more robust against overfitting. Normalization scales the pixel values of the images to a common range, typically between 0 and 1, to ensure consistent intensity levels across different images. Other possible preprocessing steps may include noise reduction, contrast enhancement, or color space conversion depending on the nature of the task and the characteristics of the dataset. However, these additional steps are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
