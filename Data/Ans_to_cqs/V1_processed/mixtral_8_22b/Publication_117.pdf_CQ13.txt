The paper does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. However, it mentions that the YOLO Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) was used with pretrained weights from the COCO dataset provided by Redmon & Farhadi (2018). It can be assumed that the authors fine-tuned the network on their own dataset, but without explicit mention of the hyperparameters used during this process, one cannot definitively state what they were.
