Based on the provided context, there is no information about specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, or scaling being applied in the deep learning pipeline. Instead, the context focuses on the use of preprocessing techniques for ALS (Airborne Laser Scanning) data and the application of various machine learning algorithms for modeling forest AGB (Above Ground Biomass). These include AdaBoost, random decision forests (RDF), multilayer neural networks (MNN), and Bayesian ridge regression (BR). The preprocessing steps mentioned involve cylindrical plot design, lidar data thinning, and calculating descriptive statistics. However, it should be noted that the absence of explicit mention does not necessarily imply that data augmentation techniques were not employed; they may simply have been omitted from the description.
