The text does not explicitly mention which specific evaluation metrics were used to assess the performance of the deep learning models. However, it mentions that the authors drilled down on the results using another high-quality model (BirdNET) and compared it to their SincNet trained models. They also experimented with dimensionality reduction techniques such as t-SNE and UMAP. Additionally, they calculated metrics for the UMAP results of each model, including the silhouette coefficient. Therefore, while the exact evaluation metrics used are not specified, it can be inferred that some form of comparison between models was performed, possibly involving measures like accuracy, precision, or recall.
