The authors do not explicitly mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model, such as using diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, they discuss using BirdNET, a research project between The Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the Chemnitz University of Technology, which has been evaluated on 984 bird species with a value of 0.5 for the minimum confidence threshold (Kahl et al., 2021). This suggests that some form of validation might have been performed during the development of BirdNET. Additionally, the authors use BirdNET to detect and classify bird vocalizations, setting its parameters to 1.5 (highest allowed value) for detection sensitivity, 1.5 seconds of overlap, and 0.4 for the minimum confidence threshold. These parameter choices could also contribute to ensuring the generalizability of the results obtained from applying this method.
