The text does not provide explicit information about all the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the hyperparameters involved in convolution operations are the size and number of kernels. The size could range from 3x3 to 5x5 to 7x7, and the number of kernels could be chosen randomly. Additionally, the text discusses the use of a SoftMax function in the final layer, but it does not mention any specific details regarding other hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer. Therefore, based on the given context, we cannot determine the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model beyond those related to convolution operations.
