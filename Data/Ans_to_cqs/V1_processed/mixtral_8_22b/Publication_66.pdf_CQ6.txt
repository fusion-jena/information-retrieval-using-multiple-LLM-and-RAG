Based on the given context, it is not explicitly mentioned what specific preprocessing steps were taken before training the deep learning models. However, generally speaking, common preprocessing steps include normalization or standardization of input features, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. In this case, the authors mention that they used GPS track data and other data within their analysis, but do not provide details about any specific preprocessing steps taken. Therefore, without additional information, I cannot provide a more detailed response regarding the preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning models in this study.
