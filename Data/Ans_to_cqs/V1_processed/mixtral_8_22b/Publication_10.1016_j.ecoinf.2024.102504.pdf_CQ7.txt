The papers do not explicitly state the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, common practices include using random sampling or time series splitting methods such as k-fold cross-validation or holdout method. It is also important to ensure that the splits maintain temporal order when dealing with time series data.

The paper by Navares et al. mentions using a sliding window approach for input sequences but does not provide details about how they divided their dataset. Similarly, Neckel et al. use machine learning techniques for analyzing air pollution data but do not specify the exact methodology used for splitting the data. Ogen uses statistical analysis to assess the relationship between COVID-19 fatalities and NO2 levels without mentioning any data partitioning strategies. Pandey discusses fly ash deposits as a potential sink for carbon sequestration but does not involve any deep learning models or data splitting procedures. Lastly, Pope et al.'s study focuses on evaluating long-term exposure to fine particulate matter and its association with mortality rates, which again does not require explicit data division for deep learning purposes.

In conclusion, while these studies employ various analytical approaches involving environmental datasets, none of them directly address the specific criteria used to divide their respective datasets for deep learning model training. Therefore, it can be assumed that standard practices like random sampling or time series splitting methods were likely employed based on individual research requirements.
