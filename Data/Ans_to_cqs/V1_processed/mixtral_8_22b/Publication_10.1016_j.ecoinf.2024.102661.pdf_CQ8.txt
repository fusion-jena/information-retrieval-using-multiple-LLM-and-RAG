The provided context does not explicitly mention where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific location such as a link to a GitHub or GitLab repository. However, it would be reasonable to assume that the authors might have made their code publicly accessible alongside their published research papers. To find the relevant repositories, one could look up the authors' names or paper titles on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Alternatively, checking the references section of the respective publications may reveal links to any associated code repositories.
