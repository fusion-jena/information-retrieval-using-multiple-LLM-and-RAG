Based on the given context, it does not explicitly state the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, typically, machine learning models stop training based on certain conditions like reaching a maximum number of epochs or iterations, early stopping if the performance on a validation set stops improving, or achieving a target metric value. In this case, since the text mentions the use of sklearn library for accuracy calculation, one possible criterion could be reaching a desired level of accuracy on the validation set. But without explicit mention of these details, we cannot definitively confirm the exact criteria used in this particular study.
