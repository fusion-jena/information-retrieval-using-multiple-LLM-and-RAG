In the given context, the authors mention applying several data augmentation techniques to improve their deep learning pipeline's performance. Specifically, they use rotation, noise, and flip for data augmentation. By implementing these techniques, they managed to increase their dataset size by six times. Data augmentation helps create a more extensive and diverse dataset, which allows the model to learn more effectively and generalize better when presented with new, unseen data.

Rotation involves rotating images by various angles, creating new versions of the original images. Noise addition introduces random variations into the images, simulating real-world conditions where images might contain imperfections or distortions. Lastly, flipping refers to horizontally or vertically mirroring images, generating additional examples without altering the essential content.

These data augmentation techniques contribute to making the CNN classification more robust and improving the overall performance of the deep learning pipeline.
