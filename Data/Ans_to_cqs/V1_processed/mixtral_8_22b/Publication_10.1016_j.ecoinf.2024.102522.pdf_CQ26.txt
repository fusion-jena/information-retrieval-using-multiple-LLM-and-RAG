To address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting is a technique where the dataset is divided into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes or labels in both sets. This ensures that the model learns from a representative sample of the entire dataset, reducing any potential biases introduced by uneven class distributions.

Oversampling is another method used to handle imbalanced datasets. It involves duplicating examples from the minority class to balance it with the majority class. Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is one popular oversampling approach that generates new synthetic samples based on feature space similarities between existing minority instances.

Undersampling, conversely, reduces the number of examples in the majority class to match the size of the minority class. Random under-sampling is a simple way to achieve this, but more sophisticated methods like Tomek links and Edited Nearest Neighbours (ENN) can also be applied for better results.

Diverse data collection aims to gather a wide variety of data points representing different aspects of the problem domain. By collecting diverse data, models can generalize better and avoid overfitting to specific patterns present only in limited subsets of the data.

These techniques help mitigate data bias during preprocessing and improve the overall performance of deep learning models. However, each technique has its strengths and weaknesses, so choosing the appropriate method depends on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the nature of the task at hand.
