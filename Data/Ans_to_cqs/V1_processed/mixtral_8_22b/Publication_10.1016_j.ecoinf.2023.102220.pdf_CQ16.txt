Based on the given context, the authors do not explicitly mention specific criteria for determining when training is complete. However, they discuss using k-fold cross-validation to choose optimal values for cluster and alpha parameters to maximize the accuracy of their proposed method. This implies that the model performance during training might be evaluated through metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score. Nevertheless, without explicit information about stopping criteria, one cannot definitively state what criteria are used to determine when training is complete.
