The text does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, it mentions that the researchers follow the standard process of optimization for each software and create multiple recognizers based on different training sets containing various numbers of manually validated recordings. This suggests that the completion of training might depend on achieving satisfactory performance metrics, such as accuracy or F-score, rather than reaching a certain point like a validation loss plateau. Additionally, the researchers validate all presences and absences both visually and acoustically, which could indicate that human judgment plays a role in determining when training is considered complete.
