The text does not explicitly mention any regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses the use of Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (Faster R-CNN) in the MegaDetector model, which is a type of deep learning algorithm used for object detection. Regularization methods like dropout and L2 regularization are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps reduce interdependent learning amongst neurons. L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, encouraging smaller weights and preventing overfitting. Although the text does not specifically state whether these techniques were employed in the development of the MegaDetector model, they could potentially be utilized to enhance its performance and generalizability.
