The deep learning approach uses Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) as the optimizer with a momentum of 0.9. The batch size is set to 50, where samples are randomly selected at each iteration. The initial learning rate is crucial for optimal performance and is set to 10^-8. However, if the learning rate is too high, it may cause the training loss to diverge, while a low learning rate might result in slower learning. The learning process stops when the average slope of the training mean loss has an absolute difference from zero over the past 100 epochs. Additionally, Batch Normalization is employed to shift and center activations, which helps in regularizing the model and allows for faster convergence.
