Unfortunately, there isn't any explicit information regarding handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline within the given context. However, some common strategies to manage randomness include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, employing techniques like cross-validation or bootstrapping to ensure robust results, and utilizing ensemble models to mitigate variance due to random initialization. These strategies help maintain consistency across multiple runs and enhance the overall reliability of the deep learning pipeline.
