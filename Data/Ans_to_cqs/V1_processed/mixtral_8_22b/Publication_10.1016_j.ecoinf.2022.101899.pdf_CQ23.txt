The authors of Halgamuge et al. (2020) did not explicitly mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model. However, they mentioned developing an algorithm to automatically collect data, which might imply some form of data diversification or stratification. Additionally, since they used deep learning technology and analyzed six different optimizer models, it suggests that they may have used some form of cross-validation during training. Nevertheless, without explicit information about these aspects, we cannot definitively state what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model.
