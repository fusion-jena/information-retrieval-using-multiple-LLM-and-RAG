Based on the given context, it appears that the authors did not explicitly discuss or employ specific techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection to address data bias during preprocessing of their deep learning pipeline. However, they did perform a sensitivity study by training models using different proportions of training data (5%, 25%, 50%, and 75%) to compare with the full dataset. This could potentially help mitigate any biases introduced due to limited training data. Additionally, they repeated this experiment five times to account for the random subsampling of annotations. They also evaluated the performance of the pretraining model alone (i.e., 0% hand-annotated data) to determine if adding hand-annotated data improved the within-site pretraining. While these approaches do not directly target data bias, they contribute to understanding the impact of varying amounts of training data on model performance.
