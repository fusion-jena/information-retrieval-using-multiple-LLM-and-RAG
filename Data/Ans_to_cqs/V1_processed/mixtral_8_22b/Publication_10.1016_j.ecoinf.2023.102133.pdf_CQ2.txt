Based on the given context, it is not explicitly mentioned what data format is used in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer that the data might be in a structured format like CSV since the dataset contains numerical values such as weather data and micro-meteorological data. Additionally, the dataset is used to estimate ETo using Eq. (3), which suggests that the data is likely in a numeric format suitable for mathematical calculations. Therefore, it can be assumed that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is most likely CSV or another similar structured format.
