The text does not provide information about the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, common metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and Area Under Curve (AUC). Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of total predictions made. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made. Recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positives. F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of both. AUC represents the degree of separability between classes, indicating how well the model distinguishes between them.
