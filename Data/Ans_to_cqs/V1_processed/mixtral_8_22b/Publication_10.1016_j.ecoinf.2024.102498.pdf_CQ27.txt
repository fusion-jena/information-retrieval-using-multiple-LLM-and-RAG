Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available from the given context to provide a detailed explanation about how the trained deep learning model was deployed. However, based on common practices in deploying deep learning models, some possible steps could include:

1. Model Serialization: After training the deep learning model, it can be saved or serialized into a file format like.h5,.pkl, or.onnx. This allows the model to be reused later without having to train it again.

2. Platform Selection: Once the model has been serialized, it needs to be integrated with a platform or application that will use it for predictions. Depending on the specific requirements of the project, different platforms may be chosen. For example, if real-time predictions are needed, then a cloud-based platform like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure might be used. Alternatively, if the focus is on mobile applications, then TensorFlow Lite or Core ML could be suitable options.

Without further details regarding the specific implementation of the deep learning model mentioned in the context, these general steps should give you an idea of what processes might have been involved in deploying the trained model.
