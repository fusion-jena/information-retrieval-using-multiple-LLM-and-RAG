The context does not provide explicit information on how the data was split for deep learning model training into sets such as train, test, and validation. However, based on common practices in machine learning and deep learning, there are several ways to split the data. One popular method is random splitting, where the entire dataset is shuffled randomly, and then divided into three subsets: training set, validation set, and testing set. Typically, the split ratios are 60-80% for training, 10-20% for validation, and 10-20% for testing. Another approach is stratified sampling, where the splits maintain the original distribution of labels in the dataset. Additionally, time series data may use forward chaining or backward chaining techniques for splitting. Without specific details about the dataset and task, it is difficult to determine the exact criteria used for splitting the data in this case.
