Based on the given information, it appears that the deep learning model used in this research is primarily designed for object detection. This conclusion is drawn from several indications throughout the text. Firstly, the mention of 'bounding boxes' suggests that the model is being employed to locate objects within images, which aligns with the task of object detection. Secondly, the establishment of detection thresholds using Intersection over Union (IoU) and confidence scores further supports this interpretation. Lastly, the comparison between different versions of YOLO (You Only Look Once), a well-known real-time object detection algorithm, reinforces the idea that the primary goal of the model is object detection. However, without explicit confirmation, we cannot definitively rule out the possibility that the model may also be utilized for additional tasks such as image classification or semantic segmentation.
