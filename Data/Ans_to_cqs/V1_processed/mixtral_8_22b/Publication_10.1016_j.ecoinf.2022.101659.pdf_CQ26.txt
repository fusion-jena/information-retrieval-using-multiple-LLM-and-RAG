The given context does not provide information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some general techniques can include stratified splitting, which ensures that the distribution of classes or labels remains consistent across training, validation, and test sets. Oversampling involves duplicating examples from the minority class, while undersampling removes examples from the majority class to balance the dataset. Another approach is diverse data collection, which aims to gather a wide range of representative samples to reduce potential biases in the dataset. These methods help mitigate issues related to imbalanced datasets and ensure fairness in model performance.

Based on the given context, it appears that the researchers have collected data using sensors deployed in two locations - the Venice Lagoon and the Wadden Sea. The data consists of valve gaping measurements, temperature, and chlorophyll levels. To analyze this data, they averaged the gaping data over different intervals depending on the location due to varying deployment periods. They also mention using daily curves of gaping as input in their analysis. While there is no explicit discussion of addressing data bias, one could infer that the researchers might have considered factors such as differences in deployment times and averaging intervals when processing the data to minimize any potential biases introduced by these variations.
