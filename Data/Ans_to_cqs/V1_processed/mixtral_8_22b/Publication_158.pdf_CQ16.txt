Training completion is determined by monitoring the validation data across training epochs. The network weights with the best performance are kept. Early stopping criteria is applied if no improvement is found in 50 epochs. This means that if the validation loss does not decrease for 50 consecutive epochs, the training process will stop. Additionally, the verification sample is used to determine training convergence of the deep-learning classifier.
