The deep learning pipeline described in the given context uses audio data. Specifically, it utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to analyze recordings of covey calls. The CNN model was trained on covey call spectrogram data, which is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies in the audio signal as they vary with time. This suggests that the raw input data might have been in an audio format like.wav or.mp3, which was then converted into spectrogram images for training the CNN model. However, the exact file formats used in the pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
