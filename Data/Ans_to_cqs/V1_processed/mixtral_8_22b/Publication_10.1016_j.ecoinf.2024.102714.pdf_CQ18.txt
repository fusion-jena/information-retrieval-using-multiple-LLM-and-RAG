Based on the given information, there isn't enough detail to provide a specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, it is mentioned that the classification of certain classes was strongly driven by Earth Observation (EO)-datasets and benefited from systematic integration of each class-specific optimized data-layers. Additionally, Table 4 shows the error matrix indicating the producer's, user's, and overall accuracy for the Vegetation Types (VT) classification model. These metrics are commonly used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models. Therefore, it can be assumed that these metrics might have been used to monitor the model performance during training.
