The targeted fish species dataset was divided into training and validation sets in an 8:2 ratio using a random selection process. This means that 80% of the dataset was allocated for training the deep learning model, while the remaining 20% was reserved for validation during the training phase. No mention was made of any separate testing set, which would typically be used after training to evaluate the final performance of the model.
