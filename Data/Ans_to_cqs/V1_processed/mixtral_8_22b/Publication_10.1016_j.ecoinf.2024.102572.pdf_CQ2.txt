The deep learning pipeline primarily uses image data, specifically high-resolution Sentinel-2 satellite images. These images are processed using machine learning techniques to identify fire-damaged areas. Additionally, the study also employs the Direct Application Programming Interface (API) in Python to retrieve necessary image data related to forest fire points in the study area. This retrieved data is then stored in CSV format on Google Drive for further analysis. Therefore, both image and CSV data formats are utilized in the deep learning pipeline.
