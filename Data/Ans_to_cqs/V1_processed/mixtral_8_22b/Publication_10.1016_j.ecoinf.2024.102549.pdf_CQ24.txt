The provided context does not directly discuss specific strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it does provide insights into how deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), can be used for water quality monitoring and predicting algal blooms in inland lakes like Lake Dianchi.

In general, handling randomness in deep learning pipelines often involves setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using ensemble methods to average out results, or employing techniques like dropout regularization to reduce overfitting caused by randomness during training. These strategies help ensure consistent and reliable performance despite inherent randomness in the process.

While these strategies aren't explicitly mentioned in the given context, they are commonly used best practices when working with deep learning models. It's important to note that each strategy has its own trade-offs and should be chosen based on the specific requirements and constraints of the problem being addressed.
