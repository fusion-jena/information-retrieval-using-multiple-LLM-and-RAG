Based on the given information, it appears that the datasets used in this study are sourced from various organizations such as Resource and Environment Science and Data Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences, National Cryosphere Desert Data Center, and National Catalog Service for Geographic Information. However, there is no explicit mention of where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query based on the given information. It would be best to refer to the original research paper or contact the authors directly for more details regarding the availability of their deep learning pipeline data repository.
