Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention or discussion about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline using techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer based solely on the information available. However, these techniques are commonly employed to handle class imbalance and ensure fair representation of all classes in the dataset.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the original class distribution. Oversampling increases the frequency of minority class examples, whereas undersampling decreases the frequency of majority class examples. These methods can help mitigate the impact of class imbalance on model performance. Additionally, collecting diverse data from various sources can also contribute to reducing data bias and improving overall model generalizability.
