The given context does not provide specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model mentioned in the report. However, common hyperparameters used in deep learning algorithms include learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, optimizer type (such as Adam or Stochastic Gradient Descent), activation functions, loss function, regularization techniques, and dropout rates. These parameters can significantly impact the performance of a deep learning model and should be carefully selected and tuned during training. Unfortunately, without additional details regarding the specific deep learning model used in this report, it is impossible to determine which hyperparameters were utilized.
