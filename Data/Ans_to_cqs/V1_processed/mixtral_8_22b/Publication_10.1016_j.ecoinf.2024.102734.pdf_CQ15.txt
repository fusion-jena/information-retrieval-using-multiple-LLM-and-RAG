The given context does not provide information about specific optimization techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of active learning, which is a type of machine learning where the algorithm can interactively query the user to obtain the desired outputs at new data points. In this case, low-certainty embeddings corresponding to features on decision boundaries are ranked higher by the recommender system. This approach helps improve the performance of the model by focusing on uncertain examples during fine-tuning. Additionally, the text discusses transductive propagation, which involves iteratively propagating labels from labeled instances to unlabeled ones based on the graph structure of the embeddings. These methods contribute to enhancing the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the deep learning pipeline but do not directly address the optimization techniques mentioned in the query.
