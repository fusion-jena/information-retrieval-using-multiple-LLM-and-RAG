The purpose of the deep learning model proposed in the given context is not explicitly stated; however, it can be inferred from the information provided. The authors present a comprehensive framework aimed at classifying water quality in order to maintain ecosystem sustainability and promote the health of aquatic organisms in aquaculture. They propose integrating IoT-based real-time data collection and segregation to overcome challenges faced by existing deep learning approaches, such as data heterogeneity, interpretability, and performance.

By utilizing real-time data collected from IoT devices, including temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and nitrate concentration, they aim to provide a holistic assessment of water quality. Furthermore, employing fish-specific acceptable ranges, they calculate a water contamination index, which enables them to accurately segregate data into contaminated and non-contaminated classes. Given this information, it can be concluded that the primary objective of the deep learning model is to perform binary classification â€“ distinguishing between contaminated and non-contaminated water samples.
