The text does not explicitly mention specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some indications that suggest certain practices were employed.

Firstly, the table shows different sets of images used for training, which could imply that a diverse dataset was utilized. This diversity might have been achieved through variations in illumination patterns or other factors not mentioned in the given context. Using a diverse dataset helps improve the model's ability to generalize well to unseen data.

Secondly, the text mentions that each machine learning approach requires hyperparameters to classify imagery, which when optimized during training can increase model performance. Hyperparameters are crucial in ensuring that the model performs well on new, unseen data. By optimizing these hyperparameters using techniques like cross-validation, one can prevent overfitting and enhance the model's generalization capabilities.

Lastly, the text discusses the use of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for modeling approaches. Both methods are known for their robustness and ability to handle complex datasets, contributing to better generalization. Furthermore, the use of a pre-trained VGG16 network suggests transfer learning, which allows models to leverage knowledge gained from solving similar tasks, thereby improving their capacity to generalize.

In conclusion, while the text does not directly address the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, it provides hints about potential strategies such as employing a diverse dataset, optimizing hyperparameters, and utilizing robust modeling approaches like SVMs and CNNs.
