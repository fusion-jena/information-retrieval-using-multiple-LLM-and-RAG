According to the given information, the deep learning tool for bat acoustic signal detection was trained using an Intel i7 processor, 32GB of RAM, and a Nvidia GTX 1080 GPU. It appears that only the BatDetect CNNFULL utilized a GPU during testing, while all other algorithms ran on the CPU. Therefore, it seems that the primary hardware resource used for training this particular deep learning model was a GPU. However, without further context or specifications regarding the training process, it cannot be definitively stated whether additional hardware resources such as TPUs were employed.
