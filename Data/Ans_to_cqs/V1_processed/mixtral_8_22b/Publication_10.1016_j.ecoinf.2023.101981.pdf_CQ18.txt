The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it discusses some aspects related to the model's performance and its configuration. For instance, the text mentions using a larger FFT window size to improve the resolution at lower frequencies where cows typically vocalize. Additionally, the authors employed cow-specific parameters in the model, which could have contributed to detecting a larger number of cow vocalizations compared to previous studies. Nevertheless, without further information or context, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the monitoring strategy for the model's performance during training.
