The context does not provide explicit information about handling randomness specifically in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions some strategies used in machine learning algorithms, including those based on decision trees, to manage randomness and improve model performance.

One strategy mentioned is bootstrapping, which is used in ensemble methods like Bagging, Random Forest, and Extra Trees. Bootstrapping involves creating subsets of the original data, with replacement, to train different models. This introduces randomness and diversity, leading to improved overall performance.

Another strategy discussed is hyperparameter tuning, which can help optimize model performance and prevent overfitting or underfitting. In this context, hyperparameters like n\_estimators, learning\_rate, max\_features, and random\_state are adjusted to find the best combination for a given problem. The tuning process may involve manual adjustments, Bayesian Optimization, or random grid search methods.

While these strategies do not directly address managing randomness in the deep learning pipeline, they demonstrate general approaches to introducing controlled randomness and optimizing model performance in machine learning algorithms. To specifically address randomness in the deep learning pipeline, common practices include setting a fixed random seed value for reproducibility, using dropout layers to introduce randomness during training, and employing techniques like batch normalization to reduce internal covariate shift caused by random initialization.
