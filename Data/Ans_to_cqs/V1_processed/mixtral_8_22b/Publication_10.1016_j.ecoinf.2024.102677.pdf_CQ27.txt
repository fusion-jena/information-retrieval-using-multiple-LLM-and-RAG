Based on the given context, it appears that the process for deploying the trained deep learning model is not explicitly mentioned. However, some information can be inferred about the steps taken before deployment.

Firstly, the authors used various performance metrics to evaluate the five network models using both the validation and test sets. They continuously monitored the model accuracy using the validation set during training and used the performance of the testing set to guide the final decision. It was observed that the ResNet architecture, particularly ResNet50 and ResNet101, performed better than the other networks.

Secondly, they selected the best performing model among the state-of-the-art CNN architectures such as VGG, Inception, and ResNet. This implies that the chosen model would have been optimized for the specific task of classifying rural landscapes.

However, there is no explicit mention of how the trained deep learning model was deployed or any details regarding model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based solely on the given context.
