Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to determine which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. The given text only mentions that the model was implemented in Python version 3.10 and uses the BirdNET Analyzer framework. It does not provide any details about the deployment environment or cloud service provider. Therefore, it is impossible to definitively state whether platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud were utilized.
