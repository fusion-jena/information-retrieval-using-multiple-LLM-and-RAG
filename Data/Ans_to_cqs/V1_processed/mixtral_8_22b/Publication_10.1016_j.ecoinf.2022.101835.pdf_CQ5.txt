Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to determine which specific datasets were used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the given context that some form of dataset was utilized since the authors mention training and optimizing various machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, Artificial Neural Networks, and Gradient Boosting Decision Trees. These algorithms typically require datasets to train and evaluate their performance.

However, the exact nature of these datasets cannot be determined based solely on this context. They could range from image datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, to other types of datasets such as text, audio, or time series data. Without further details about the problem domain or the type of task being performed, it would be speculative to guess what kind of datasets were employed.
