The paper does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it mentions using a diverse dataset from various habitats and comparing the performance of multiple software programs. This suggests some level of robustness testing. Additionally, the study uses a large target dataset consisting of 32,640 recordings, which could contribute to the model's ability to generalize well. Nevertheless, without clear details regarding techniques such as cross-validation, stratified sampling, or other methods commonly employed to enhance model generalization, it is difficult to definitively state what measures were specifically taken to ensure the model's generalizability.
