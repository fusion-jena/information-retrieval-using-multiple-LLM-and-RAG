The given context does not provide information about specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, there is mention of a dataset called the GREMM dataset, which was used for evaluating discrimination accuracy using Siamese Neural Network (SNN) and Ensemble MIA approaches. Unfortunately, without additional context, further details regarding the nature of the GREMM dataset cannot be determined.
