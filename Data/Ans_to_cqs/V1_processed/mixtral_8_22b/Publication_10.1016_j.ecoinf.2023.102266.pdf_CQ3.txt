The provided context does not directly discuss specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, based on general knowledge about deep learning pipelines, these techniques are commonly employed for tasks like object detection and image segmentation. Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangles around objects within images to identify their location, while instance segmentation requires labeling individual pixels belonging to distinct objects. These methods help train models to recognize and classify various elements present in visual data accurately.

The context primarily focuses on improving a model through modifications to the update criterion, optimizing the scope, applying machine learning tools, and implementing variance-reduction strategies. It also mentions limitations related to computational resources when using Monte Carlo methods for simulation purposes. Nonetheless, without explicit information regarding data annotation techniques used in this particular case, one cannot definitively state which ones were applied during the development process.
