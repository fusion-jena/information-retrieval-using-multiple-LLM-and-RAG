Based on the provided information, there isn't any explicit mention of the specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, we can infer from the results section that the authors measured the performance of their proposed model after each epoch. An epoch refers to one complete pass through the entire dataset, where the model sees every sample once. After each epoch, they likely calculated the accuracy of the model on a validation set to track its progress over time. This allowed them to observe how well the model was learning and whether it was improving or not. Additionally, they may have monitored other metrics such as loss, precision, recall, and F1 score to gain more insights into the model's performance. Without additional details, this is our best guess based on common practices in deep learning research.
