The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the weighted F1 score. The F1 score is a harmonic mean of precision and recall, offering a balanced assessment of both false positives and false negatives in the classification outcomes. To determine the F1 score, the true labels and predicted majority classes for each transect are first derived from the combined data. Subsequently, the Python Scikit-learn library is employed to generate the confusion matrix for the actual and anticipated labels, taking into account the three categories: "p", "w", and "r". Lastly, the weighted F1 score is computed utilizing the f1_score function from Scikit-learn, setting the parameters as the true labels, predicted labels, and average parameter as "weighted".
