The text does not provide information about the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. It only discusses the use of DeepLabv3+ architecture for semantic segmentation tasks, specifically for herbarium specimen segmentation. The authors mention using ResNet-101 as a feature extractor and fine-tuning the model on their dataset but do not specify where the code for this implementation can be found. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
