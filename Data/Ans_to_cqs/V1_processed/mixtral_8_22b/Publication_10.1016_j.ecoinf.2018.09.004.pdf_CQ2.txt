In the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific data formats such as images, audio, video, or CSV files. However, it does provide some information about the type of data used in the study. The researchers use temporal variables, which could potentially come from various sources like time series data, sensor readings, etc. They also mention using static variables, which might be stored in any format depending upon the source. Furthermore, they discuss using NetCDF pixels, indicating that they are working with geospatial data.

NetCDF (Network Common Data Form) is a self-describing, machine-independent data format commonly used in meteorology, oceanography, and other scientific fields dealing with large datasets. It allows for efficient storage and retrieval of multidimensional data, making it ideal for handling geospatial data.

Based on these details, while the exact file formats aren't specified, it appears that the researchers primarily deal with numerical data, possibly including geospatial data in NetCDF format.
