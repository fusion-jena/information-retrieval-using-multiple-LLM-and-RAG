The information provided does not explicitly state the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the data used in the studies mentioned are primarily related to remote sensing imagery, specifically Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) images. These images are derived from satellite or airborne sensors and are typically stored in raster data formats such as GeoTIFF or other similar formats suitable for geospatial data. Additionally, some studies may use ancillary data in various formats like CSV or Excel files for metadata or additional variables. Nonetheless, without explicit mention of the exact data format used in the deep learning pipeline, we cannot definitively confirm the specific file types utilized.
