To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, a diverse dataset was created using synthetic data to train the model. This allowed the model to learn from a wide range of scenarios, improving its ability to handle real-world data. Secondly, the model was validated using a ground truth created from real multi-spectral (MS) point clouds. This validation process helped assess the model's performance when applied to actual data. Lastly, the SoftGroup architecture was trained over 1000 epochs for each type of input data, and metrics like Mean Intersection over Union (MIoU) or Mean Accuracy (MA) were computed after each epoch. This analysis of training performance enabled the selection of the configuration weights that achieved the best classification performance. These weights were then used to establish the reference trained model, which was subsequently used to perform predictions on the real MS point clouds collected earlier.
