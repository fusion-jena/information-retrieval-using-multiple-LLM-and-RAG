Based on the given context, it appears that the study involves image processing and analysis using remote sensing data from Landsat 8 OLI and TIRS bands and Google Earth Engine (GEE). However, there is no specific information about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. Nevertheless, some common preprocessing techniques used in image processing include normalization, scaling, cleaning, augmentation, and feature extraction. Normalization scales pixel values between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1, while scaling adjusts the range of pixel values. Cleaning removes noise and artifacts from images, while augmentation increases the size of the dataset through transformations such as rotation, flipping, and zooming. Feature extraction extracts relevant features from images that can be used as input to machine learning models. In summary, the exact preprocessing steps required depend on the nature of the data and the specific requirements of the deep learning model being trained.
