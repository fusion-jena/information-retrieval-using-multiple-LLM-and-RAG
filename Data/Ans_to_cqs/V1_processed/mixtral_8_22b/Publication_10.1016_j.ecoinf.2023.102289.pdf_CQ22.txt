Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model employed by LaDeco. However, considering that LaDeco utilizes the deeplabv3+resnet269 model, which is primarily designed for semantic segmentation tasks, we can infer that common evaluation metrics for such tasks might have been considered. These could include metrics like Intersection over Union (IoU), also known as the Jaccard index, Pixel Accuracy, Mean Pixel Accuracy, and Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU). IoU measures the overlap between the predicted and ground truth segments, while Pixel Accuracy calculates the proportion of correctly classified pixels. Mean Pixel Accuracy averages the pixel accuracy across all classes, and mIoU computes the average IoU across all classes. Nevertheless, without further details from the original source, these remain speculative suggestions.
