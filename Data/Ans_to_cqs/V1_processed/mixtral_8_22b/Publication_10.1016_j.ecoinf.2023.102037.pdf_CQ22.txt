The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using standard metrics commonly used in object detection datasets such as MS COCO. These include Precision and Recall. Precision measures the fraction of the target insects in the detected objects, while Recall measures the fraction of detected target insects from all the target insects within one image. A Precision-Recall (PR) curve is used to evaluate the overall model performance for insect detection. Average Precision (AP) is the area under the PR curve for a given IoU threshold, and mAP is the mean AP for all insect classes in the dataset. The formulas for these metrics are provided in equations (1), (2), and (3) in the paper.
