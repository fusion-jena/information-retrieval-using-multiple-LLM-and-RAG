The text does not explicitly state what type of data format is used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that researchers face challenges due to a lack of data in cation studies. It also discusses the use of deep learning methods for image classification for individual identification of various species, including snow leopards. Additionally, it refers to recent advances in deep learning that facilitate the growth of convolutional neural network (CNN)-based systems for image processing concerns, particularly for camera trapping image analysis. Therefore, based on this information, it can be inferred that one of the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline is likely images.

However, without explicit confirmation from the authors or additional context, it cannot be definitively stated whether other types of data formats such as audio, video, or CSV files are also utilized in the deep learning pipeline.
