The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, such as using diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it mentions several aspects related to improving the robustness and reliability of the models and analyses performed.

Firstly, the authors emphasize the importance of investigating scale sensitivity, arguing for more frequent and rigorous testing of scale sensitivity. They also mention developing ArcGIS Python scripts to facilitate this type of scale sensitivity tests for other analysts. Additionally, they suggest comparing results with other datasets, including historical land surveys and travel journals, to validate findings and avoid spurious scale-dependent relationships.

Secondly, the authors discuss segmentation and classification strategies in eCognition, highlighting ongoing developments in methodologies and rule sets for automatically selecting segmentation parameters. They express optimism that better classifications will be achievable as these tools continue to advance. Furthermore, they note the integration of machine learning techniques with image segmentation to improve automatic image classification. Despite this progress, they stress the necessity of human supervision and validation using aerial photo interpretation techniques or additional data sources.

Lastly, the authors describe their use of Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) for analyzing their data due to its suitability for dealing with polygons of varying sizes and non-normal response variables. They employed a Markovian Random Field basis for the smoothing function and chose the quasi-binomial family to account for overdispersion.

In summary, while the text does not explicitly detail specific measures like diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, it highlights various efforts aimed at enhancing the robustness and reliability of the models and analyses conducted. These include investigating scale sensitivity, utilizing advanced segmentation and classification strategies, integrating machine learning techniques, and employing suitable statistical models for handling complex datasets.
