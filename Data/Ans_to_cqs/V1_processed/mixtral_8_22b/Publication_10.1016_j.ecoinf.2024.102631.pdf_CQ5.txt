The deep learning pipeline uses several datasets for training and testing purposes. Among them are the UIEB test dataset, UIEB challenge dataset, U45, and UCCS dataset. These datasets were utilized to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model both qualitatively and quantitatively. Additionally, the trained model was validated on a private underwater imaging dataset acquired from an open sea environment under various conditions. However, it should be noted that while the model performed well on most datasets, its performance fell short on the C-60 dataset, primarily due to the challenging nature of the dataset, which includes deep water scenes with low-light visibility.
