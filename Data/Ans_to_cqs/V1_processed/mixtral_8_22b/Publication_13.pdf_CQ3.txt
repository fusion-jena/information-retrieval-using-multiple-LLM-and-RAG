Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation being used in their deep learning pipeline. However, it does state that they used taxon labels from the source images during training, suggesting some form of supervised learning. It also mentions that they used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification tasks, which typically requires labeled data for training. Therefore, while not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that some form of data annotation technique would have been necessary to provide the required labeled data for training their CNN model.
