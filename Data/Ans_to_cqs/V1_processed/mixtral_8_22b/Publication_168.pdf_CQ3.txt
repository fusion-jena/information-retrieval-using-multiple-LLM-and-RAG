The given context does not provide information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for Hyperspectral Image (HSI) classification tasks. However, generally speaking, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and labeling or tagging. These techniques help in creating labeled datasets required for supervised learning algorithms like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). For HSI classification tasks, pixel-wise labeling might be employed due to the high dimensionality and rich spectral information present in each pixel of the hyperspectral images.
