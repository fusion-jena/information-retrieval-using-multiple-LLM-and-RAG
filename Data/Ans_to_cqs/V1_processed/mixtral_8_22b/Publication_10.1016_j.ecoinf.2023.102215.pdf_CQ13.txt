The deep learning model was trained using the Adam optimizer with default hyperparameters. These include beta values set to (0.9, 0.999), an initial learning rate of 1.0 x 10^-3, and a weight decay of 0. The model was implemented using PyTorch version 1.13.0.1. Training images were uniformly resized to 288 x 288 pixels. The model was trained from scratch with a batch size of 12. The training process took approximately 11.5 hours after 65K iterations until the training loss converged.
