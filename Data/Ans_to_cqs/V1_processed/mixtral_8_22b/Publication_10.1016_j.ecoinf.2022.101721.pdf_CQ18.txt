The text does not provide explicit information regarding the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions that the classification accuracy of software incorporating an informative prior in their algorithm should not be determined through training and testing datasets alone. Instead, the performance must also be evaluated through the number of correct classifications using real-world examples. Additionally, implementing Bayesian algorithms allows users to interact with the software, potentially improving its performance. Therefore, while there isn't a clear description of the monitoring strategy, we can infer that evaluating the model's performance involves assessing its ability to correctly classify real-world examples and possibly utilizing user feedback when employing Bayesian algorithms.
