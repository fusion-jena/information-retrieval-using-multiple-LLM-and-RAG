The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, considering the information about the model's performance evaluation based on an independent test set of 2060 images, out of which 950 are true positive red kites images, it can be inferred that the model is likely designed for object detection or classification tasks related to identifying red kites in images. Additionally, the mention of using pre-trained algorithms to reliably identify predefined classes such as the presence of birds in image data suggests that the model might be employed for classifying bird species in images. Nevertheless, without explicit confirmation, one cannot definitively state the exact purpose of the deep learning model.
