The text does not explicitly mention which specific deep learning framework was used to build the model. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer based on the given information.

Based on the context, we only know that Google Earth Engine (GEE) was used for high-performance computing and hosting a vast remote sensing data catalog. The platform supports JavaScript, Python, or R application programming interfaces (APIs) and allows for advanced image processing techniques and machine learning (ML) algorithms. However, there is no explicit reference to any particular deep learning framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
