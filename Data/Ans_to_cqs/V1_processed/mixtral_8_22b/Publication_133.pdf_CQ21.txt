After the model training, several postprocessing steps can be performed to evaluate the model's performance and interpret its predictions. Some examples include:

1. Model evaluation: Comparing the model's predictions with the ground truth using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to accurately detect objects and avoid false detections.

2. Confusion matrix: Constructing a confusion matrix to visualize the model's performance across all classes. It helps identify patterns of misclassification and provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the model.

3. Saliency maps: Generating saliency maps to understand the regions of input images that contribute most significantly to the model's output. They highlight areas where the model focuses its attention during decision making.

In the given context, the authors have followed these postprocessing steps:

1. Model evaluation: The authors compared the model's predictions with the ground truth using metrics like false positives (FP), false negatives (FN), and true positives (TP). They also adopted a commonly used threshold value of 0.5 for intersection over union (IoU) to determine meaningful object detection.

2. Confusion matrix: Although not explicitly mentioned, the authors calculated three elements of a confusion matrix - FP, FN, and TP. However, they did not mention calculating true negatives (TN), which would complete the confusion matrix.

3. Saliency maps: There is no information regarding the generation of saliency maps in the given context. Therefore, it cannot be confirmed whether the authors employed this technique as part of their postprocessing steps.
