Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved to ensure the quality and suitability of the input data. While the specific steps may vary depending on the nature of the data and the requirements of the model, some common preprocessing techniques include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing or correcting any inconsistencies, errors, or missing values in the data. This step ensures that the model is trained on accurate and reliable information.

2. Normalization/Standardization: Deep learning models often perform better when the input features have similar scales. Techniques such as Min-Max Scaling, Z-Score Normalization, or Log Transformation can be applied to rescale the data within a certain range or distribution.

3. Feature Selection/Extraction: Depending on the complexity of the problem, not all input features might contribute equally to the output. Selecting relevant features or extracting new ones through dimensionality reduction techniques (like PCA) can help improve the model's efficiency and performance.

4. Encoding Categorical Variables: Since most deep learning models work with numerical inputs, categorical variables should be converted into numerical representations. Common encoding techniques include One-Hot Encoding, Label Encoding, or Target Encoding.

5. Splitting Dataset: Before training the model, the dataset is usually split into three subsets: training set, validation set, and test set. The training set is used to train the model, while the validation set helps tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Finally, the test set provides an unbiased evaluation of the model's performance.
