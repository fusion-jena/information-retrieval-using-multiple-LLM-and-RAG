The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the study uses imagery data, specifically images of insects and diseases on plants. It also refers to the use of large image datasets to train deep neural networks like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). From this, we can infer that the raw data collection method likely involves capturing images of the target subjects, possibly through digital cameras or other imaging devices. Additionally, the mention of leveraging large image datasets suggests that publicly available datasets might also be used as part of the data collection process. Nevertheless, without more specific details from the context, it cannot be definitively stated what exact methods are employed for gathering raw data in this particular deep learning pipeline.
