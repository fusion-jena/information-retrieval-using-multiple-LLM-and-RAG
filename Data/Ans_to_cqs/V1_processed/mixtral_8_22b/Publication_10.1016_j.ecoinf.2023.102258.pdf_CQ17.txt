The text does not provide explicit information about the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions several techniques employed by various systems, such as using CNN architectures, framewise processing, and attention mechanisms. These techniques could potentially help mitigate overfitting indirectly by improving model generalization. For instance, convolutional layers in CNNs share weights across different spatial locations, reducing the number of parameters and helping prevent overfitting. Framewise processing involves breaking down longer audio sequences into smaller segments, which might also aid in preventing overfitting by simplifying the learning task. Attention mechanisms allow models to focus on relevant parts of the input, possibly leading to better generalization. Nevertheless, without more detailed information about the implementation of these systems, we cannot definitively state whether any standard regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization were explicitly applied.
