Based on the given information, there isn't any explicit mention of specific data formats such as images, audio, or video being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, since the neural networks are designed to handle inputs like Day Of Year (DOY) and Growing Degree Days (GDD), it suggests that the data format used might be numerical data, possibly stored in structured formats like CSV files. This assumption is further supported by the fact that the study focuses on dealing with regression problems, where the goal is often to predict continuous outcomes based on numeric input features. Therefore, it seems likely that the data format used in this deep learning pipeline would involve some form of tabular or numerical data rather than multimedia formats like images or videos.
