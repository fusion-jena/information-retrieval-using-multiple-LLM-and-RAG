Based on the given information, it appears that the specific names of the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline were not explicitly mentioned. However, there are references to two different datasets: one referred to as the 'Canadian' dataset and another unnamed dataset referred to as the 'local' dataset. These datasets seem to be related to the task of single seed classification and retrieval. Unfortunately, without further context or details about these datasets, I cannot provide their exact names or sources.
