The raw data used in the deep learning pipeline for insect ecoinformatics can be collected through various means. These include long-term ecological monitoring, citizen science projects, and museum catalogs. Long-term ecological monitoring involves systematic observation and collection of data over extended periods, often focusing on specific species or habitats. Citizen science projects engage non-professional volunteers in scientific research, contributing valuable data to the field. Museum catalogs provide historical records of specimens, offering insights into past distributions and abundances of different species. Additionally, other sources like remote sensing technologies, drones, and automated traps can also contribute to the pool of raw data.
