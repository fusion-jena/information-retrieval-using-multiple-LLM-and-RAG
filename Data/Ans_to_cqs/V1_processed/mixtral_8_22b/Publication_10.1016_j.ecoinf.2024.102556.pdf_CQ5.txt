The given text does not provide any specific details about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the datasets used in this case.

However, some commonly used datasets in deep learning include MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet. These datasets contain labeled images that can be used for training and testing machine learning models. For example, MNIST is a dataset of handwritten digits, while CIFAR contains tiny natural images. ImageNet is a large-scale image database containing millions of labeled images belonging to thousands of categories.
