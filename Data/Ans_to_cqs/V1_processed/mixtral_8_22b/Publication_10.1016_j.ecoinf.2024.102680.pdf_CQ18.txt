Based on the given context, it appears that the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves preprocessing operations on the initial images. These preprocessing operations include resizing the images to the required size and applying algorithms such as mosaic data augmentation. These steps aim to make the distribution of the input data more uniform and enhance the ability of the model to represent the data, which in turn improves the model performance during training. However, there is no explicit mention of a specific monitoring strategy for tracking the model's performance during training. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, we can only infer that these preprocessing steps contribute to enhancing the model's performance during training.
