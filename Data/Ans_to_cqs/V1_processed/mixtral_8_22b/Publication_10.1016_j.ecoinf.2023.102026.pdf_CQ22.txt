The text does not mention any deep learning models or their evaluation metrics. However, it discusses the use of several metrics to evaluate the performance of generalized linear models (GLMs): Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), Percent Correctly Classified (PCC), sensitivity, specificity, and True Skill Statistic (TSS). These metrics are calculated using the 20% camera traps retained from the training dataset for the non-bootstrapped GLM, and the data retained from the model training (composed of 80% of the presence and absence locations) for the bootstrapped GLM. The results of 100 validation iterations are then averaged to obtain the final metrics. This process is independently implemented for each felid species.
