The text does not explicitly state what data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information given, we can infer that images are likely used in the pipeline since the authors mention using red, green, blue, and depth channels, which are typically associated with image data. Additionally, they reference Mask R-CNN, which is a popular method for object instance segmentation in images. They also discuss distance sampling with camera traps, suggesting that their approach involves analyzing images captured by cameras. Therefore, while not explicitly stated, it appears that the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is images.
