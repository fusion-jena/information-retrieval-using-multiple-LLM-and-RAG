Based on the given information, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data. This is evident from several references such as "input images", "batch of input images", and "lazy image labeling". Additionally, the mention of "random horizontal flipping" and "random Â±7o rotation" further supports the use of image data in the pipeline. Furthermore, the keywords section includes terms like "fish detection" and "highly turbid waters", indicating that the image data pertains to underwater environments. However, there is no explicit mention of other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV being used in the pipeline. Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be concluded that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data.
