The given sources do not provide explicit information about specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, one source mentions the use of deep learning for feature extraction in remote sensing [Petrovska et al., 2020]. This implies that some form of optimization technique is likely being employed within this process, but it does not specify which particular methods were utilized. Therefore, based on the available information, we cannot definitively state what optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline.
