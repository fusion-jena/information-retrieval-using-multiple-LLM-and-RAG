Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of Drupal as a content management system for the Marine Institute's Data Catalogue, but it does not provide a direct link to this or any other external data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, without additional context or information, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query regarding the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline.
