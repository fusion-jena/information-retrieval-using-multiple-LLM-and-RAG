The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in this context is for classification. Specifically, the authors use a Multiple Target Multiple Instance Spectral Mixture Filter (MTMI-SMF) algorithm for detecting invasive plants such as Brazilian pepper tree (Schinus terebinthifolius) in remote sensing imagery. They compare its performance to another popular machine learning method called Random Forest. Both methods aim to accurately classify whether a given area contains the invasive plant based on spectral information gathered by sensors. However, unlike traditional machine learning algorithms that rely on a single pixel to represent a training location, MTMI-SMF allows for grouping pixels surrounding a training location, providing more flexibility when dealing with imperfect data due to locational errors or mismatches between training locations and image pixels.
