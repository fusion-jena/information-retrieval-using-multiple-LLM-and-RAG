Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about how the data was split for training, testing, and validation purposes in the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the parameters used for validation were obtained through calibration with the removal of seasonality from the WAVES' LAI data. It also mentions that the Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated between the FERM output and validation data for 2009. Therefore, it can be assumed that the data was divided into training and validation datasets, but no specific details regarding the splitting criteria have been mentioned.
