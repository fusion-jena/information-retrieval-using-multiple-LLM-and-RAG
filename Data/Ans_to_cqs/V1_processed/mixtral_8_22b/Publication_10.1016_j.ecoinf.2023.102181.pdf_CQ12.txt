The text does not provide explicit information about the use of any specific deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. Instead, it discusses the application of machine learning methods, specifically focusing on the Random Forest algorithm, which is an ensemble learning method based on decision trees. This approach is employed to improve predictive performance through covariance-weighted bagging, potentially reducing bias during model training. However, there is no mention of deep learning models being utilized within the described pipeline.
