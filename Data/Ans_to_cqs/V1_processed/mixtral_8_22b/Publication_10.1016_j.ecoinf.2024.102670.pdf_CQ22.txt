The paper uses several metrics to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. These include average precision, recall, F1-measure, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MMC). Additionally, Lin's Concordance Coefficient (œÅc) is used to measure the strength of agreement between the gold standard method (manual tracing) and the proposed automated method for measuring mycelium length.
