The information provided does not specify which type of deep learning model was used in the pipeline. The only mention of a specific deep learning algorithm is the use of a multilayer perceptron (MLP), but it is not clear if this is the primary or sole deep learning component of the pipeline. Other machine learning models mentioned include logistic regression, na√Øve Bayes, CatBoost, random forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, weighted soft voting, weighted hard voting, blending, and stacking. However, none of these are explicitly identified as deep learning models. Therefore, based on the given information, I cannot determine what type of deep learning model was used in the pipeline.
