Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning models. However, common practices often involve normalizing or scaling the input data, cleaning the dataset by removing irrelevant or redundant features, handling missing values, and sometimes augmenting the dataset through techniques such as rotation, cropping, or flipping images. In this case, since no explicit details about preprocessing steps are mentioned, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the exact methods used for these models.
