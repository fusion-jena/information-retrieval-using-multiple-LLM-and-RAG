The text does not provide explicit information about the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions that the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function was employed in the training process of EPDNet. This suggests that monitoring the MSE loss value might have been part of the strategy to evaluate the model's performance during training. Additionally, the R2 metric was used to assess the model's fit to the observed data after training, indicating that tracking the R2 score could also have been a component of the monitoring strategy.
