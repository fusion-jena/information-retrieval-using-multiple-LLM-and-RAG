The text mentions several preprocessing steps taken before training a deep learning model. These steps include normalizing all input channels (red, green, blue, and depth) by subtracting the respective mean and dividing by the respective standard deviation over the whole dataset. Additionally, a feature fusion module is introduced to combine the extracted features from both backbones using one 3 × 3 convolution per FPN scale and reducing the number of channels from 2 × 256 to 256. This step allows the use of weights pre-trained on the Microsoft COCO dataset for the region proposal network (RPN) classifier and mask head. Another preprocessing step mentioned involves training a standard deep learning classifier (ResNet-50 pre-trained on ImageNet) on cropped bounding box images of detected objects. To augment the training dataset, additional images obtained from internet image search engines were used. However, due to noisy annotated images, filtering different types of label noise was required to improve the recognition performance of the system.
