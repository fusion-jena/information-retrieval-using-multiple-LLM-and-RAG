Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model mentioned in the paper titled "Verification of novel integrations of swarm intelligence algorithms into deep learning neural network for flood susceptibility mapping." Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the exact hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer used in their deep learning model. It would be best to refer directly to the original research article for this information.
