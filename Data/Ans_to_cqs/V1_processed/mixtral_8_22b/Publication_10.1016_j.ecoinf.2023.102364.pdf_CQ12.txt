The article does not explicitly mention the use of any deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. Instead, it discusses using an ensemble of machine learning models, specifically Random Forest, TreeNet, Classification and Regression Trees (CART), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS). These are not considered deep learning models but rather traditional machine learning techniques. Therefore, no specific deep learning model was mentioned in the given context.
