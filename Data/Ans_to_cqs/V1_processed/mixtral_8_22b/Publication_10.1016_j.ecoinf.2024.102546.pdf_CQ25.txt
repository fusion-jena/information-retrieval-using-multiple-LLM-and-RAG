The primary purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, based on the information available, it can be inferred that these models are used for weed detection. Specifically, YOLOX and YOLOv8 are mentioned as detection models with their respective hyperparameters listed. These models likely use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify and locate weeds within images or video frames. Additionally, the table mentions location loss using IoU (Intersection over Union) and CIoU (Complete Intersection over Union), which are commonly used metrics for object detection tasks. Therefore, it can be concluded that the main objective of these deep learning models is to perform weed detection.
