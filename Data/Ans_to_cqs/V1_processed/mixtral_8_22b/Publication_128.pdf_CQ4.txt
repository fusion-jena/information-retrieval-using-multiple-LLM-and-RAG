The given context does not provide specific details about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, I can explain some common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. Data augmentation is a strategy that enables practitioners to significantly increase the diversity of data available for training models without actually collecting new data. Commonly used data augmentation techniques include:

1. Flipping: Images can be horizontally or vertically flipped to create new variations. This technique helps the model generalize better since objects in real life may appear in different orientations.

2. Rotation: Images can be rotated by various angles to generate new samples. This helps the model learn to recognize objects regardless of their orientation.

3. Scaling: Images can be scaled up or down to simulate objects appearing closer or farther away. This helps improve the robustness of the model against changes in object sizes.

4. Translation: Images can be shifted along the x and y axes to mimic small movements of the camera or the object itself. This helps the model become invariant to minor shifts in position.

5. Shearing: Images can be sheared to introduce perspective distortions, making the model more resilient to such transformations.

6. Noise injection: Random noise can be added to the pixels of an image to help the model handle noisy input during inference.

7. Color space transformation: Images can be converted to grayscale or have their color histograms altered to make the model more robust to changes in lighting conditions.
