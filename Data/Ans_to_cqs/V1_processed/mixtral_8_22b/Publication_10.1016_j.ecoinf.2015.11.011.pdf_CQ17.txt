The given context does not provide information about the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, it discusses segmentation and classification strategies in eCognition, which are rapidly evolving, and mentions that machine learning techniques are being combined with segmentation to improve image classification. The text also emphasizes the importance of considering scale sensitivity when analyzing data and suggests comparing results with other datasets to avoid spurious scale-dependent relationships. Additionally, it highlights opportunities of the modeling approach, although no further details are provided regarding its application to deep learning pipelines.
