The deep learning architecture used in this study follows a VGG style network, which was previously used for classifying acoustic scenes. The network is trained using Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 10^-4. The categorical cross entropy is utilized as the loss function. The batch size is set to 64 samples and the network is trained with 200 epochs.
