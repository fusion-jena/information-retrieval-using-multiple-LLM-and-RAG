Based on the given information, it appears that the new method for calculating Wetland Use Intensity (WUI) is deployed using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) processing environment. The text mentions that the method is fully automated in the cloud-based GEE processing environment. However, there is no explicit mention of which specific platform such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) was used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, we cannot definitively determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
