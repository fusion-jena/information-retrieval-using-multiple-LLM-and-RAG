The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss using machine learning methods to determine if an animal is present in an image, suggesting that the input data format could be images. Additionally, the article mentions using bounding boxes, which are often associated with image or video data. Therefore, it can be inferred that the primary data format used in this case might be images. However, without further information, it cannot be confirmed if any additional data formats such as audio, video, or CSV files were utilized in the deep learning pipeline.
