The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) that are commonly used in the deep learning pipeline. However, there are references to Support Vector Machines (SVM) and their parameter optimization. The literature mentions that SVM parameters are set based on the default values of Google Earth Engine's guidelines, specifically choosing Radial Basis Function (RBF) as the kernel type and setting the Gamma (Î³) and cost parameters to 0.5 and 10, respectively. Additionally, the context discusses the use of Random Forest and Decision Tree algorithms, which are part of ensemble learning techniques but do not directly relate to optimization techniques in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot provide a direct answer regarding the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
