The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it is clear from the context that manual validation was performed on various sets of songs (S2 and S3). This suggests that one of the data annotation techniques employed could have been audio labeling or tagging, where experts manually validate and categorize different sounds or songs. Additionally, the use of deep neural networks mentioned in Benkendorf and Hawkins (2020) implies that some form of supervised learning might have been applied, requiring labeled datasets. Therefore, while the exact technique remains unknown, we can infer that manual validation and possibly audio labeling were part of the data annotation process.
