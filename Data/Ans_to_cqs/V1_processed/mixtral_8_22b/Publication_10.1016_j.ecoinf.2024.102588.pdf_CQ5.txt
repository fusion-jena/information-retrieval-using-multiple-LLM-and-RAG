The given context does not provide specific details about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that deep learning algorithms, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), have been successfully applied to estimate variables in aquatic environments, such as water quality, streamflow, and algae. This suggests that the datasets used could potentially include various types of environmental data related to these factors. Unfortunately, without more specific information, it is impossible to definitively state what datasets were used in this particular case.
