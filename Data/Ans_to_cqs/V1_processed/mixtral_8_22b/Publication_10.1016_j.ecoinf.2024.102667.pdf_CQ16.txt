The context does not provide information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, common criteria include a validation loss plateau, where the model stops improving its performance on the validation set, or reaching a predefined number of epochs or iterations. Other criteria may involve monitoring metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score on the validation set. The choice of criteria depends on the specific problem and goals of the machine learning task.

Based on the given context, it appears there was no direct mention of the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, generally speaking, some commonly used criteria include observing a validation loss plateau, which indicates that the model has stopped improving its performance on the validation set. Another criterion could be reaching a predefined number of epochs or iterations during the training process. Additionally, other criteria may involve monitoring various evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score on the validation set. Ultimately, the choice of criteria will depend on the specific problem and objectives of the machine learning task at hand.
