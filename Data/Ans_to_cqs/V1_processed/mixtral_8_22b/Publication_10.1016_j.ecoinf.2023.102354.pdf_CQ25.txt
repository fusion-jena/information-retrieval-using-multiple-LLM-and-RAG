Based on the given context, the purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated. However, considering the overall theme of the text, we can infer that the deep learning model aims to enhance understanding and investigation of groundwater-climate interactions within the sub-basins of the Great Artesian Basin (GAB) region. Given that the GAB is subject to diverse climatic conditions ranging from semi-arid to arid, with varying levels of rainfall across different regions, the deep learning model could potentially be used for tasks such as predicting or classifying climate patterns, identifying areas prone to drought, or analyzing the impact of climate change on groundwater resources. Additionally, the mention of previous studies related to drought risk assessments and groundwater table depth predictions suggests that these might also be relevant applications for the proposed deep learning model. Nonetheless, without further information, it is difficult to determine the exact purpose of the deep learning model with certainty.
