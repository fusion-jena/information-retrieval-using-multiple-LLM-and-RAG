The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves splitting the input training data into two sets; 70% of the samples are used for training and 30% for testing. This approach allows estimating the ability of the Deep Neural Network (DNN) algorithm to map burned areas in the study area. Additionally, an accuracy assessment using validation points was conducted to further evaluate the model's performance.
