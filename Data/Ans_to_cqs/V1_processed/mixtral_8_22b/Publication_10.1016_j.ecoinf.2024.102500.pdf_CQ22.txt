In the given context, the performance of the machine learning models is evaluated using several metrics. For dissolved oxygen (DO) prediction, the statistical markers used include coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), mean bias error (MBE), mean absolute error (MAE), Nashâ€“Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and index of agreement (D). Among these, R2 and RMSE are the primary metrics used to assess the performance of the models.

For instance, Random Forest (RF) outperforms other models with training and testing R2 values of 0.76 and 0.66, respectively, and RMSE values of 0.36 and 0.45, respectively. Additionally, the RF model has lower MBE, MAE, D, and higher NSE values, indicating reduced inaccuracies and substantial input-DO associations.

However, it should be noted that the context does not provide information on the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), Gradient Boosting (GB), Histogram-based Gradient Boosting (HGBM), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) models. Nevertheless, based on the available information, we can infer that similar metrics such as R2, RMSE, MBE, MAE, NSE, and D may have been used to evaluate their performance.
