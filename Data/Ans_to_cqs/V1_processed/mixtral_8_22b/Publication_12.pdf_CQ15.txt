The text does not provide explicit details about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the authors optimized the parameter settings of the batch size, which is a hyperparameter often adjusted during the optimization process. Common optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp), and others. Without more specific information, it cannot be determined which optimization technique was employed in this case.
