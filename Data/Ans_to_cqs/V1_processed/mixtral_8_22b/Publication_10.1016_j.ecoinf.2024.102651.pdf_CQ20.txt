Unfortunately, there isn't any specific mention of the hardware resources used for training the deep learning models in the given context. However, typically, deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Vision Transformers (ViT), and others often require substantial computational power, usually provided by Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). These units are specifically designed to handle parallel operations, making them highly efficient for matrix multiplication tasks common in deep learning algorithms.
