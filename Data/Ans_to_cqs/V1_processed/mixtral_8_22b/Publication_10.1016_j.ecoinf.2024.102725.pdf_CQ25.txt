The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is not explicitly stated; however, it can be inferred that the model is used for improving the reconstruction of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series. This is achieved by applying deep-learning enhanced fusion methods, which likely involve some combination of classification, segmentation, or detection tasks within the broader goal of enhancing NDVI reconstruction. The primary focus appears to be on improving the accuracy of predictions related to vegetation coverage and phenological events, such as crop growth stages or wildfire risk assessment.
