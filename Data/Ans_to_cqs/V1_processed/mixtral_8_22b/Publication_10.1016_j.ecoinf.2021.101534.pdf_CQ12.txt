A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based approach is used in the pipeline. This is evident from the mention of CNN-based approaches in the first line of the given context and the statement about developing an autonomous wildlife sound identifier using a high-performance CNN-based classifier. Additionally, the use of spectrograms as input images for model training further supports this conclusion since CNNs are commonly used for processing grid-like topology data such as images.
