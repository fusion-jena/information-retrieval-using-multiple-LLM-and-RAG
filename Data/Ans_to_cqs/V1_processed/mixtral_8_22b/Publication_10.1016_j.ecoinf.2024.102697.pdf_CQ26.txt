The text does not provide explicit information about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of a repeated nested k-fold cross-validation approach to ensure accuracy and reliability of results. This technique can help mitigate bias related to random sampling. Specifically, an outer 10 k-fold cross-validation provides an initial division of the data into holdout data and data for model development. Then, an inner 5 k-fold cross-validation is used to minimize the bias caused by tuning of hyperparameters on training results. This process is repeated multiple times to further reduce potential bias and variance related to random sampling. While this approach addresses some aspects of bias, it does not directly mention stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection as techniques to handle data bias during preprocessing.
