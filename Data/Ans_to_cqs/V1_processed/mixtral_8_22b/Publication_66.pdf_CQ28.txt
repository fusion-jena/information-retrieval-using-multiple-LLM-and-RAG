Unfortunately, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine which specific cloud platform or service was used to deploy the deep learning model. The text only mentions that the deep learning models were constructed in R using H2O, but does not provide any details about where these models were deployed or run. Therefore, without additional information, we cannot definitively state which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
