The given context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the data used in this case involves remote sensing images, which could be in various formats such as GeoTIFF, JPEG, or PNG. The context also mentions the use of Sentinel-2 data, which provides multispectral high-resolution optical imagery. Additionally, there is a reference to the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) data, which could include images or videos captured by drones. It should be noted that the exact format of these data would depend on how they were processed and prepared for input into the deep learning pipeline.
