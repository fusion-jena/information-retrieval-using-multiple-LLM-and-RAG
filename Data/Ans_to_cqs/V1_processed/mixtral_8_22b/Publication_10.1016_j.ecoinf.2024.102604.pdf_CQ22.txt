The text does not provide information about the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. However, it mentions two indicators used to evaluate the effectiveness of each model in correcting the sampling bias: the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and another metric denoted as 'D'. The AUC is a common metric used in machine learning to measure the performance of binary classifiers, while the meaning of 'D' is not explicitly defined in the given context. It can be inferred that these metrics are used to compare the performance of corrected models against uncorrected ones, rather than evaluating the overall performance of a deep learning model.
