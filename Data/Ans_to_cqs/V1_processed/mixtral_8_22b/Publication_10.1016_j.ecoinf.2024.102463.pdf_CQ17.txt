While the provided context does not explicitly mention specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization, these techniques are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting. Regularization methods help improve generalization by adding constraints to the learning process, thus preventing complex co-adaptations on training data.

Dropout is a popular regularization technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, effectively creating a sparse network. By doing so, dropout helps reduce interdependent learning amongst neurons and encourages them to learn individually useful features.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function based on the squared magnitude of all trainable weights. This discourages large weights and promotes smaller ones, leading to simpler models that generalize well.

Other regularization methods include early stopping, data augmentation, and batch normalization. Early stopping involves monitoring validation accuracy during training and halting the process once performance starts degrading. Data augmentation generates new samples from existing data through transformations like rotation, scaling, or flipping, increasing dataset diversity and reducing overfitting risk. Batch normalization standardizes layer inputs across mini-batches, improving convergence speed and overall performance.
