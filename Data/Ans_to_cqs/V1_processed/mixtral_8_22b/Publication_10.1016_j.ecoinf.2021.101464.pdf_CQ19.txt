Based on the given information, it is not possible to determine which specific frameworks were used to build the deep learning model. The text only mentions that the random forest model was applied using R statistical software and the "RandomForest" package. There is no mention of any other machine learning or deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this query based on the available information.
