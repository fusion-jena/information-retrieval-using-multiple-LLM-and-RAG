The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the models are designed for fish detection in turbid waters. This is evident from the description of the FishInTurbidWater dataset and the mention of developing two novel deep learning networks for enhancing the capability of marine scientists in turbid underwater and coastal environment monitoring. Additionally, the use of EfficientNet-B7, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), further supports the idea that the models are intended for object detection tasks, specifically for detecting fish in turbid waters.
