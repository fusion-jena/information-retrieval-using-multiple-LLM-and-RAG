The text does not provide explicit information on the specific methods or tools used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that some species records were sourced from surveys that recorded both presence and absence, as well as incidental records from the public. This suggests that the data collection process may have involved a combination of structured surveys and crowdsourcing efforts. Additionally, the use of occurrence records implies that sensor data could also have been employed. Therefore, while the exact methods remain unclear, we can infer that the study likely incorporated multiple approaches such as surveys, public contributions, and potentially sensor data to gather its raw dataset.
