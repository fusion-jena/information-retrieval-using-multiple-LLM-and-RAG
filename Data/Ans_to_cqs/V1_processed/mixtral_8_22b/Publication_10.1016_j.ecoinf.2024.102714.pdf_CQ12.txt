The text does not provide information about the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it mentions that a Python implementation of the XGBoostClassifier was used for classification tasks. XGBoost stands for Extreme Gradient Boosting, which is a popular machine learning library designed for supervised learning problems. It uses gradient boosting framework, where new models are created that predict the residuals or errors of prior models and then added together to make the final prediction. Therefore, it is not a deep learning model like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers.
