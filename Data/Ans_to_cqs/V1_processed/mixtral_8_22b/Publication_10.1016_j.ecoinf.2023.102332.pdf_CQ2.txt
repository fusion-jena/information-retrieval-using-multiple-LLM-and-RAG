The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses various techniques and tools related to text mining, natural language processing, and machine learning. Given this focus, it can be inferred that the primary data format used in these pipelines is likely textual data, such as those found in documents, webpages, and social media posts. Techniques like BERT, Word2Vec, and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) are all designed to process and analyze textual data. While other data formats like images, audio, and video may also be relevant in certain applications, they are not directly discussed within the given context.
