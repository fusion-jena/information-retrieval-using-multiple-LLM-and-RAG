In the given context, two main metrics are mentioned for evaluating the performance of the land use and land cover (LULC) classification using deep learning models: Overall Accuracy (OA) and Kappa Index (KI). These metrics are calculated using a confusion matrix derived from validation points. The OA is determined by dividing the total number of correctly classified pixels by the total number of pixels and multiplying by 100. On the other hand, the KI measures the agreement between predicted and observed categories while accounting for chance agreements. It is computed using the formula presented in the context, which involves summing the diagonal elements of the confusion matrix and normalizing it by the total number of pixels squared.
