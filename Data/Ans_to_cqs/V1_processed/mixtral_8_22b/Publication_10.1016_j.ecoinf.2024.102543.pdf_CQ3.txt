In the given context, the data annotation technique used is manual annotation using Make Sense. Specifically, a single "bug" class was created to fully contain the visible outline of the NBSB insects. Although not explicitly mentioned, this method likely involves either bounding box annotation or pixel-level semantic segmentation, both common techniques for object localization and classification tasks. Bounding boxes draw rectangles around objects of interest, while semantic segmentation assigns labels to individual pixels within an image. Given the description of outlining the insects, it seems plausible that semantic segmentation was employed in this case.
