Before training a deep learning model such as Wav2Vec, several preprocessing steps may be involved depending on the nature of the input data. In the case of Wav2Vec, which deals with audio data, some common preprocessing steps include:

1. Normalization: This step involves adjusting the values of the input features so they fall within a specific range, typically between -1 and 1 or 0 and 1. For example, in Wav2Vec, the raw waveform is normalized before being passed through the convolutional layer.

2. Dimensionality reduction: To reduce computational complexity and improve performance, high-dimensional input data can be transformed into lower-dimensional representations. In Wav2Vec, this is achieved using a feature encoder that converts the raw waveform into a sequence of feature vectors.

3. Data augmentation: This technique involves creating new samples by applying various transformations to existing ones, thereby increasing the diversity of the training set. Although not explicitly mentioned in the given context, data augmentation techniques such as noise injection, time stretching, and pitch shifting could potentially be applied to audio data.

4. Cleaning: Depending on the quality of the input data, it might be necessary to remove any irrelevant or redundant information. However, since the given context does not provide details about the input data, it is difficult to determine if any cleaning steps were performed prior to training the Wav2Vec model.
