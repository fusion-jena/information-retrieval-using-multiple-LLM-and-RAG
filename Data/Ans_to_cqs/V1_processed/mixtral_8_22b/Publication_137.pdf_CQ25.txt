The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is to perform semantic segmentation of point clouds. This is achieved through a multi-step process involving geometric partitioning, conversion of partitions into superpoints, superpoint embedding using a PointNet network, and finally segmentation of the point clouds using a graph convolutional network (GCN). The goal is to accurately classify different tree species within the point cloud dataset, which is crucial for various applications in forestry research, monitoring, and management.
