The article does not provide specific information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, it mentions two common methods for hyperparameter optimization: grid search and random search. Grid search involves testing all possible combinations of hyperparameters within a predefined range, while random search randomly selects combinations of hyperparameters to test. Both methods can be used to find the optimal set of hyperparameters for a given model. It should also be noted that there are many other methods for hyperparameter optimization, such as Bayesian optimization and evolutionary algorithms. Without further information, it cannot be determined which method was used in this particular study.
