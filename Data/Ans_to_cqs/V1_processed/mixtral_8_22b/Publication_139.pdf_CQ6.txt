The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning models. However, it can be inferred that some form of preprocessing must have occurred due to the nature of the input data being spectrogram images derived from audio recordings. Typical preprocessing steps for image data include resizing, normalization, and augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, and cropping. For audio data, common preprocessing steps might involve filtering, denoising, and converting raw waveform data into spectrogram representations using methods such as Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT), Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), or Constant Q Transform (CQT). Unfortunately, without explicit information about the preprocessing steps applied in this case, we cannot provide a definitive list of the exact steps taken.
