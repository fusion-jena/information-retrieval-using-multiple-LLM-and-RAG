Data augmentation techniques are widely used in deep learning pipelines to increase the amount of training data available by applying random transformations to existing images. This helps prevent overfitting and improves the generalization performance of the trained models. Some common data augmentation techniques include:

1. Flipping: Images can be flipped horizontally or vertically to create new variations. This technique is often used in image classification tasks.

2. Rotation: Images can be rotated by a certain degree to generate new samples. This technique is useful for object detection and segmentation tasks.

3. Scaling: Images can be scaled up or down to change their size. This technique is helpful for improving the robustness of models against different scales.

4. Cropping: Random cropping can be applied to extract smaller patches from larger images. This technique is commonly used in computer vision tasks like object detection and localization.

5. Shearing: Images can be sheared along one axis to introduce distortions. This technique is beneficial for enhancing the diversity of the dataset.

6. Brightness and contrast adjustment: Image brightness and contrast can be adjusted randomly within a specified range to simulate various lighting conditions.

7. Noise injection: Gaussian noise or other types of noise can be added to images to improve the model's tolerance to noisy inputs.

These data augmentation techniques can be combined and applied simultaneously during training to further enhance the variability of the input data. It is essential to choose appropriate data augmentation strategies based on the specific task requirements and characteristics of the dataset.
