Unfortunately, there isn't enough context provided to accurately describe the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, based on common practices in machine learning projects, after training the model, it would typically be serialized or saved so that it can be loaded later without having to train again. This could involve saving the model weights or creating a complete copy of the model object. As for platform selection, depending on the use case, the model might be deployed on various platforms such as cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure, or on edge devices for real-time predictions. But since no specific details about these aspects are given in the provided context, I cannot provide a more precise answer.
