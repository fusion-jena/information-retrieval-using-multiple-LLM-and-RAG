The text does not provide explicit information about the specific purpose of the deep learning model used in the study. However, it mentions that intelligent models based on extreme learning machines were proposed to predict Water Quality Index (WQI) at the Kinta River basin using seven water quality parameters (WQPs) as inputs. Therefore, we can infer that the purpose of the deep learning model was likely related to making predictions or estimations regarding water quality indices based on various input parameters. This could involve tasks such as regression or forecasting, but without more detailed information, it cannot be definitively stated whether the model was specifically designed for classification, segmentation, or detection purposes.
