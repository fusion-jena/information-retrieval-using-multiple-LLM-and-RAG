The paper titled "Multi-scale context aggregation by dilated convolutions" discusses the use of dilated convolutions for multi-scale context aggregation in deep learning models. However, it does not provide information about data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

On the other hand, several papers mentioned in the given context discuss various data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines for detecting and classifying crop pests. For example, the paper titled "A vision-based counting and recognition system for flying insects in intelligent agriculture" uses bounding box annotations for generating ground truth data. Similarly, the paper titled "Automatic localization and count of agricultural crop pests based on an improved deep learning pipeline" also mentions the use of bounding box annotations for object detection tasks.

Moreover, the paper titled "Field detection of tiny pests from sticky trap images using deep learning in agricultural greenhouse" describes the use of instance segmentation for identifying individual objects within an image. Instance segmentation involves labeling each pixel in an image with its corresponding object category and instance ID. This technique can be useful for accurately detecting small or overlapping objects in complex scenes.

Additionally, the paper titled "Classification and detection of insects from field images using deep learning for smart pest management: A systematic review" provides a comprehensive overview of different data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines for pest detection and classification. These include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. Semantic segmentation involves assigning a single label to every pixel in an image, while instance segmentation distinguishes between multiple instances of the same object category.

Overall, the given context suggests that various data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation are commonly used in deep learning pipelines for detecting and classifying crop pests. Each technique has its own advantages and limitations, and the choice of technique depends on factors such as the complexity of the scene, the size and shape of the target objects, and the desired level of accuracy.
