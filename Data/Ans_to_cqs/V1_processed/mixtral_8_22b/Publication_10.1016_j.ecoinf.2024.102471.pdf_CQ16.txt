Based on the given context, it appears that the criteria used to determine when training is complete involve monitoring the loss and accuracy graphs by varying epochs. In this case, the proposed transfer learning using the wav2vec approach is observed to perform very well with fewer epochs due to the wav2vec model's general understanding of sounds learned during its pre-training phase on a large audio dataset. This suggests that the completion of training might be determined by observing the performance of the model on the validation set and stopping the training once the performance reaches a satisfactory level or starts to plateau. However, the specific threshold values or criteria for determining the completion of training are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
