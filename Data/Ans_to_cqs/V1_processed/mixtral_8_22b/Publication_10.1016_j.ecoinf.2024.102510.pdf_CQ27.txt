The text does not provide information about the specific process used to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, common practices include model serialization, which involves saving the model architecture and weights into a file or database, and platform selection, where the deployment environment is chosen based on factors such as scalability, security, and ease of integration. Other considerations may also apply depending on the use case and requirements.
