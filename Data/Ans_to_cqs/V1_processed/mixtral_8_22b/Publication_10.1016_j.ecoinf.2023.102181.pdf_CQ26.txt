The text does not provide explicit details about specific techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection for addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses methods related to reducing bias in machine learning models, particularly focusing on bagging applications like Random Forest.

In the given context, the authors suggest correcting for the effects of clustering sampling on bagging models using residual spatial autocorrelation information. This approach involves determining weights according to empirical estimates of spatially autocorrelated errors. These weights help reduce bias during model training and enable obtaining unbiased estimates of model performance during validation.

Moreover, the authors mention that non-independent data observations can be seen as partial replications of some information in the modeling dataset. They illustrate this point with an extreme example of two data points having exactly the same environmental measurements at the same location.

Although the discussed methodology primarily focuses on addressing bias in bagging models rather than preprocessing steps for deep learning pipelines, it highlights the importance of considering data characteristics, such as spatial autocorrelation, when dealing with biases in machine learning models.
