Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the exact hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model called EMViT-Net. However, it can be inferred that some form of optimization was performed during the training process since the text mentions that the model performs well with an augmented set of EMDS-6 datasets. Additionally, the use of a kernel of size 3 and strides with size 1 suggests that these parameters were chosen for feature extraction within the convolutional layers of the model. Furthermore, the application of max-pooling and average pooling techniques indicates that the dimensionality of the extracted feature space was reduced. Lastly, the inclusion of a separable convolutional parameter-sharing attention block and batch normalization implies that these methods were employed to improve the stability and speed of the model's training process.
