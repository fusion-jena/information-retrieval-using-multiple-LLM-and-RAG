The pipeline uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as the deep learning model. The architecture of the CNN includes three convolution layers with 32, 64, and 128 output filters respectively. Each convolution layer has a kernel size of 3x3. Additionally, there is a fully connected layer consisting of 512 neurons and a softmax layer for classification. The CNN is implemented using the Keras library in Python.
