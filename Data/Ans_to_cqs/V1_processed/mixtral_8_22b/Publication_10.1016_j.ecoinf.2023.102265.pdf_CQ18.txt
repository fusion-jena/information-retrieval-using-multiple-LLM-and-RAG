The text does not explicitly state the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions that the training and validation of their classifier were done using a basic laptop with a specific CPU configuration. Additionally, they mention using 5-fold cross-validation when training their SVM model. This suggests that they might have been monitoring the model performance during training by evaluating it on different subsets of data through cross-validation.
