The given context does not explicitly mention any specific techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection for addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses some relevant aspects related to improving the quality of training samples and reducing uncertainty in the selected training samples.

In the context of high spatial resolution satellite image data, the authors utilize the pixel quality control metrics of MODIS products to eliminate cloud-contaminated and poor-quality pixels and remove outliers from the training samples. This step ensures that only good-quality pixels are considered for further analysis. Additionally, they perform purity screening by selecting MODIS pixels where the same land-use type accounts for more than 90% of the area and the coefficient of variation (CV) of reflectance is less than 0.3. This process helps maintain consistency among adjacent pixels of the same land cover type and reduces variability within each MODIS pixel.

Furthermore, mixed pixel linear decomposition is applied based on the assumption of linear modeling of hybrid pixel decomposition. This technique allows for expressing LAI and reflectance in MODIS hybrid pixels as a combination of different components, which may help mitigate potential biases introduced by mixed pixels containing multiple land cover types.

Although these steps do not directly correspond to the mentioned techniques for addressing data bias, they contribute to enhancing the overall quality and reliability of the input data for the deep learning pipeline. Incorporating additional measures such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, or collecting diverse datasets might further improve the robustness and generalizability of the developed models.
