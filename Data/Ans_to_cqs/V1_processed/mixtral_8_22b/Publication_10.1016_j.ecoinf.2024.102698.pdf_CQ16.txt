The given context does not provide information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, generally speaking, common criteria include reaching a certain number of epochs, achieving a desired level of accuracy or performance, observing a plateau in the validation loss, or meeting other predefined thresholds. These criteria depend on the nature of the task, the type of model being trained, and the goals of the project. Without more specific details regarding the training process mentioned in the context, I cannot provide a definitive answer.
