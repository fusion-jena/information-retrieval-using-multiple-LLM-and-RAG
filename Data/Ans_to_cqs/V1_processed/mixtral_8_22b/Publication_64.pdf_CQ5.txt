The paper uses three different datasets for training and evaluating their deep learning models. They use the PlantNet dataset for training, which contains around 250k images belonging to over 6k plant species of Western Europe. Each image in this dataset has been labeled by experts and comes with a tag specifying the focus of the image, such as 'habit', 'flower', 'leaf', 'bark', etc.

For evaluation purposes, they use three external datasets: Google Image Search, Portuguese Flora, and iNaturalist. The Google Image Search dataset consists of 3680 labels with more than 12 images in the training dataset. They automatically retrieve the first 10 images returned by the Google Image Search engine for each label. However, since this process is automated, there may be some minor mislabeled or corrupted examples present in the dataset. To minimize this issue, they only choose the most popular labels and retrieve the top results.

The Portuguese Flora dataset is another external dataset used for evaluation. Unfortunately, no further details about this dataset were provided in the given context. Lastly, the iNaturalist dataset is also used for evaluation. Again, no specific information was provided regarding this dataset.

In summary, the paper uses the PlantNet dataset for training and three external datasets - Google Image Search, Portuguese Flora, and iNaturalist - for evaluation purposes.
