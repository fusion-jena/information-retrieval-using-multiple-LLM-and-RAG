The text does not provide specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that there is a limitation in the dataset size due to the small number of labeled images available in each category. To address this issue, existing deep learning techniques are combined with statistical fundamentals. Additionally, the text discusses the use of deep learning in various ecological topics, including the identification of animal species and the estimation of biodiversity in large datasets. Despite these references, no explicit mention of any specific datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet is made in the given context.
