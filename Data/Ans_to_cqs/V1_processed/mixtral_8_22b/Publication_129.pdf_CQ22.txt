The performance of the developed system for insect pest recognition is evaluated using four basic classification metrics for image-based classifiers. These include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Accuracy is calculated by summing true positives (TP) and true negatives (TN) divided by all possible outcomes of the classification process. Precision represents the relationship between the true positive predicted values and all positive predicted values. Recall, also known as sensitivity, presents the ratio between the true predictive positive values and the summation of both predicted true positive and predicted false values. Lastly, the F1-score demonstrates the overall accuracy measure of the developed classifier by combining the double ratio of both the precision and recall metrics.
