After the model training phase, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the project or study. Here are some common postprocessing steps:

1. Model evaluation: The first step is usually evaluating the trained model's performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves, etc. These metrics help assess how well the model has learned to predict the target variable. In this case, the Area Under Curve (AUC) and True Skill Statistic (TSS) have been used to evaluate the model's performance.

2. Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix is often created to visualize the performance of the classification model. It shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions made by the model compared to actual outcomes.

3. Saliency Maps: Saliency maps are heatmaps that highlight important features contributing to the model's decision-making process. They provide insights into which input variables significantly impact the output. However, there is no mention of saliency maps in the given context.

4. Ensemble Prediction: An ensemble approach combines multiple models to improve overall performance. In this case, a weighted averaging method was employed to generate an ensemble prediction, where each model was assigned a weight based on its predictive accuracy on the test data.

5. Data Visualization: Postprocessing may also involve creating plots and charts to better understand the results and communicate them effectively.

In summary, the postprocessing steps mentioned in the given context include model evaluation using AUC and TSS, generating an ensemble prediction through a weighted averaging approach, and possibly other unmentioned techniques like confusion matrices and data visualizations.
