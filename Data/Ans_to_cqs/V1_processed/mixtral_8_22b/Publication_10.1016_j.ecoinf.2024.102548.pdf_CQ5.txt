The context does not provide explicit details about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the models such as MobileNet, EfficientNet, InceptionV3, and InceptionResNetV2 were pre-trained on extensive or large-scale datasets. This suggests that these models might have been initially trained using popular datasets like ImageNet, which contains millions of images belonging to thousands of categories. Additionally, the mention of image classification tasks implies that the dataset could contain labeled images suitable for supervised learning. Unfortunately, without further context, we cannot determine the exact datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
