Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer to your query. However, it can be noted that some datasets mentioned in the context are accessible via certain platforms such as the General Office of Geodesy and Cartography (GUGiK)'s Geoportal for Spatial Information Infrastructure (<https://www.geoportal.gov.pl>) and PlanetScope's satellite imagery. These sources may contain relevant data for developing a deep learning pipeline, but they do not represent a complete deep learning pipeline themselves.
