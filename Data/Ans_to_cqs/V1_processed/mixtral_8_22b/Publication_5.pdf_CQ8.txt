The information regarding the specific code repository for the deep learning pipeline mentioned in this context is not explicitly stated. Therefore, it cannot be determined where the code repository is available, such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. However, it is mentioned that TensorFlow (<https://tensorflow.org>) was used to develop the species richness estimation model. TensorFlow is an open-source platform for deep learning, so it can be assumed that the code might be available somewhere online, possibly even on one of these platforms. But without further information, the exact location of the code repository remains unknown.
