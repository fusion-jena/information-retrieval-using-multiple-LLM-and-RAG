The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, based on general machine learning practices, some common postprocessing steps could include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., creating confusion matrices, and performing error analysis. These steps help evaluate the performance of the trained model and identify any potential issues or biases. It is important to note that the exact postprocessing steps may vary depending on the specific requirements and goals of the project.
