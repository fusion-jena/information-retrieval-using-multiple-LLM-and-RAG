Unfortunately, there is no information available regarding which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. The given context focuses primarily on the programming languages, frameworks, and datasets used for building and training the networks but does not provide any details about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine whether AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or another service was utilized for deploying the deep learning model.
