The provided context does not directly address the query about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide some general information on this topic.

Randomness in deep learning pipelines often comes from various sources, including weight initialization, data shuffling, dropout regularization, and others. To handle this randomness, several strategies are commonly used:

1. Fixed Random Seeds: One common approach is to set a fixed random seed value before running any code involving random operations. This ensures reproducibility across different runs or machines.

2. Multiple Runs: Another strategy is to run the model multiple times with different initializations and aggregate the results. This helps reduce the impact of individual random seeds and provides a better estimate of the overall performance.

3. Cross-Validation: Using cross-validation techniques, such as K-fold cross-validation, can help mitigate the effects of randomness by training and testing the model on different subsets of the dataset.

4. Ensemble Methods: Combining multiple models trained with different random seeds into an ensemble can also help reduce the variance caused by randomness.

5. Bayesian Optimization: Instead of using a single random seed, one could use Bayesian optimization methods to search over a range of possible hyperparameters, including random seeds, to find the best combination.
