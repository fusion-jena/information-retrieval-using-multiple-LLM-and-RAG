The text does not provide explicit information on the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that the developed three-layer feedforward back-propagation neural network has an architecture of 30-20-10, with activation functions being tansig, tansig, and purelin, respectively. Additionally, the input factors are population size and GDP, while the predicted output is GHGdwts. It is also stated that 70% of the data were used for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for model testing. Furthermore, the GHGdwts predictions showed the ANN model was accurate with R2 = 1. Therefore, based on this information, one can infer that the metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model is R2 or coefficient of determination, which measures how well the observed outcomes are replicated by the model. Other common evaluation metrics for deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, etc., but these are not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
