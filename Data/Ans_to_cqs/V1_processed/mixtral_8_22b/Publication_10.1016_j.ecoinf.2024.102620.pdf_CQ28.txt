Based on the given information, it appears that the deep learning model was not deployed using any specific cloud service provider such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. Instead, the authors utilized Google Earth Engine (GEE), which is a web-based platform for planetary-scale geospatial analysis. The GEE provides access to petabytes of satellite imagery and other datasets, along with tools for processing and analyzing this data. Therefore, it can be assumed that the deep learning model was developed and executed within the GEE environment itself. However, if there were additional details about the deployment of the model, they would need to be explicitly mentioned in order to provide a definitive answer.
