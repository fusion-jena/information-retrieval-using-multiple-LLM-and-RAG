The paper by S. Ghosh et al. discusses a methodology for optimizing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) hyperparameters using a combination of Big Bang-Big Crunch (BBBC) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms. In this study, several hyperparameters are considered, including convolution layers, filters, filter sizes, numbers of neurons, batch sizes, epochs, and model optimizers. The range of values for these parameters is defined within specific lower and upper limits.

Regarding optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, the authors mention various model optimizers such as ADAM, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp), Adadelta, Adagrad, and Adamax. These optimizers help improve the training process of the CNN models by adjusting the weights and biases based on the calculated gradients during backpropagation.

For instance, ADAM combines the advantages of both adaptive learning rate methods like RMSProp and momentum-based methods like SGD. It calculates individual learning rates for different parameters from estimates of first and second moments of the gradients. This allows it to converge faster and perform well even with noisy data or sparse gradients.

Similarly, other mentioned optimizers have their unique features and benefits. For example, SGD uses only one sample per update, making it computationally efficient; however, it may suffer from slow convergence due to noise in the updates. On the other hand, RMSProp addresses this issue by dividing the learning rate by an exponentially decaying average of squared gradients, which helps stabilize the learning process.

Overall, the choice of optimization technique depends on factors such as computational resources, dataset characteristics, and desired trade-offs between speed and accuracy. By integrating BBBC and PSO algorithms, the authors aim to find optimal hyperparameter configurations for CNN models more efficiently while maintaining high prediction accuracy.
