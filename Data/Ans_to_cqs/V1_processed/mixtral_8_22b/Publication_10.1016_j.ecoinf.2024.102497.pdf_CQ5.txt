Based on the given context, it appears there is no direct mention of any specific dataset used in a deep learning pipeline like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the context discusses the use of GF-6 (WFV) data obtained from the China Centre for Resources Satellite Data and Application for predicting wetland areas and depths using different models.

In this study, researchers primarily focused on utilizing remote sensing data from the GF-6 satellite and applying various models, including linear or nonlinear regression, logarithmic ratio transformation, and machine learning techniques such as CART, RFR, and SVM. They also mentioned advancements in bathymetry retrieval methods leading to the development of multiple models.

However, if you need information about datasets commonly used in deep learning pipelines, here's some general knowledge:

1. MNIST: A database of handwritten digits widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning. It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

2. CIFAR: Consists of two datasets - CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Both contain 60,000 color images scaled down to 32x32 pixels. CIFAR-10 consists of 10 classes, while CIFAR-100 has 100 classes.

3. ImageNet: A large visual database designed for use in visual object recognition software research. It currently holds more than 14 million images, which are organized into roughly 21,000 categories.
