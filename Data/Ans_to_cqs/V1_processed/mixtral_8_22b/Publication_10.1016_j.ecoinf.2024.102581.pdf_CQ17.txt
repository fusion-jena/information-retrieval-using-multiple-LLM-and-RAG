Regularization methods are techniques used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models, including deep learning pipelines. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well and performs poorly on unseen or validation data. Regularization helps improve the model's ability to generalize to new data. Two common regularization methods mentioned in the given context are dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent complex co-adaptations on training data. This method forces the network to distribute the learned information across all neurons rather than relying heavily on specific ones. By doing so, it reduces the gap between training and validation results and improves the model's generalizability.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function based on the sum of squared weights. This encourages smaller weights, making the model simpler and less likely to overfit. In other words, L2 regularization discourages large weights, promoting a more balanced distribution of weights among the features.

Other regularization methods not explicitly mentioned in the provided context include L1 regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation. L1 regularization, like L2, adds a penalty term but uses the absolute value of the weights instead of their square. Early stopping involves monitoring the model's performance on a separate validation set during training and halting the process once the validation error starts increasing. Data augmentation generates additional training samples by applying transformations such as rotation, scaling, or flipping to existing images, helping the model become more robust and less prone to overfitting.
