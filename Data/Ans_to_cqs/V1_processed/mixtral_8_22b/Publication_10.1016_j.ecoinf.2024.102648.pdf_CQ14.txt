The text does not provide specific information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, it mentions that Shang and Zhu (2021) proposed a prediction model that combines the genetic algorithm and machine learning algorithms, including ANN, to forecast the occurrence of insect pests. The use of a genetic algorithm suggests that they may have employed some form of optimization strategy to tune the hyperparameters of their model. Grid search and random search are common methods for hyperparameter tuning, but without more detailed information, it is impossible to determine which method was used in this case.
