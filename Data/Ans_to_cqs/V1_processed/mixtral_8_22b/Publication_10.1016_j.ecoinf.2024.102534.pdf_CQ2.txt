The given context does not provide information about the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it lists various roles and contributions made by different individuals towards a project or study. These roles include writing - review & editing, writing - original draft, supervision, resources, investigation, data curation, validation, visualization, software, methodology, formal analysis, conceptualization, and project administration. Based on these roles, we can infer that the team worked with some form of data, but the exact format (image, audio, video, CSV, etc.) is not mentioned. Therefore, without additional context, it is impossible to determine what data formats were used in their deep learning pipeline.
