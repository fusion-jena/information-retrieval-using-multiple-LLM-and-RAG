The text does not explicitly mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it does provide some clues about the possible types of models being employed. For instance, the use of convolutional kernels suggests that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) might be involved in the pipeline. Additionally, the reference to feature pyramids and networks like PANet and BiFPN indicates that object detection or segmentation tasks could be part of the pipeline, which typically involve CNN architectures. Nevertheless, without explicit confirmation, it cannot be definitively stated what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline.
