Early stopping was used to prevent overfitting and determine when training should cease. Typically, the model trained between 10 and 15 epochs before training ceased. Each epoch took roughly 1 minute on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU. Both the conventional accuracy metric and the area under the curve, as computed by a Riemann sum, were used for training.
