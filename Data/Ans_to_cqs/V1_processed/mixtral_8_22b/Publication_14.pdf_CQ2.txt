Based on the given context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily uses video data format. This is evident from several references such as "For training the fine-tuned neural network, I collected images for each class" and "Model evaluation on the 70 test videos". Additionally, there is mention of extracting feature vectors from the frozen layers which suggests that the input data is likely in image format. However, without explicit confirmation, we cannot rule out the possibility of other data formats being used in the pipeline.
