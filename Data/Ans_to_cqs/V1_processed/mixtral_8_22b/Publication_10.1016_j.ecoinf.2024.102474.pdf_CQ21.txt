Unfortunately, there is no information available regarding any specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices. However, it can be inferred that some form of evaluation was performed using the validation set during the training process, as mentioned in section 3.1. Model Training Efficiency. This evaluation likely included calculating scores based on the performance of the models, which were then used to determine the best performing model. Additionally, it appears that the optimization was stopped once the validation score repeatedly failed to improve compared to previous epochs, suggesting that some sort of metric was being tracked throughout the training process.
