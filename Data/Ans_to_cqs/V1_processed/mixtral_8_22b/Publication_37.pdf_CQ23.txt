To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the dataset used was diverse, consisting of 5428 flight calls from 43 different species. This diversity helps prevent overfitting and improves the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. Secondly, the models were evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation. Cross-validation is a technique used to assess how well a statistical model will generalize to an independent dataset. It involves reserving a portion of the available data for testing the model and using the rest of the data for training. This process is repeated multiple times, each time with a different portion of the data being used for testing. The results are then averaged across the runs. Lastly, stratified splitting was not explicitly mentioned but can be assumed given the nature of the task. Stratified sampling ensures that each fold in the cross-validation contains approximately the same percentage of samples of each target class as the complete set. This is particularly important when dealing with imbalanced datasets, which is often the case in real-world scenarios.
