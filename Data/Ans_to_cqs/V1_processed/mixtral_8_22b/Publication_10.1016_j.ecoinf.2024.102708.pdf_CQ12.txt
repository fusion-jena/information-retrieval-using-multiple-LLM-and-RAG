The article discusses the use of two main object detection models, YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN (FR-CNN), for detecting Pacific oysters using drones and remote sensing techniques. Both models are based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Specifically, YOLOv5 is a lightweight approach that identifies objects directly through a single pass, while FR-CNN is a multi-stage network approach that first identifies potential regions before categorizing and discarding inappropriate ones. For the YOLOv5 model, three variants were tested: YOLOv5 small, YOLOv5 medium, and TPH-YOLOv5. TPH-YOLOv5 is a modified variant of YOLO with a Transformer Prediction Head (TPH). Therefore, the pipeline uses both traditional CNN-based models like YOLOv5 and FR-CNN, as well as a hybrid model combining CNN and Transformers, namely TPH-YOLOv5.
