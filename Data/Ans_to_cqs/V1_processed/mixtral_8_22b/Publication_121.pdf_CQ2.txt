Based on the given context, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images. This is evident from several references made throughout the text. For instance, the dataset is mentioned to consist of 5789 images for training and 1930 images for testing. Furthermore, the context discusses the use of pre-trained models like MobileNetV2, MobileNetV3-Large, and MobileNetV3-Small, which are known to work primarily with image data. Additionally, the mention of using OpenCV-python3 library further supports this inference, as OpenCV is typically used for working with images and videos. However, there is no explicit mention of any other data formats like audio, video, or CSV being used in the deep learning pipeline.
