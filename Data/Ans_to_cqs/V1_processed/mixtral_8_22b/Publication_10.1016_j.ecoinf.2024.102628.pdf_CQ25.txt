The purpose of the deep learning model is to classify 2D point cloud images into three categories: "Plateau", "White-sand", and "Riparian". This is achieved by employing the fast.ai platform and utilizing a Leave-One-Group-Out (LOGO) cross-validation method. The pretrained ResNet-34 architecture, a variant of the Residual Network family, is used within the fast.ai framework to leverage existing knowledge due to the small size of the dataset. The model is retrained for each fold in the cross-validation process to prevent information transfer from previous folds.
