Unfortunately, none of the provided context directly addresses the specific strategies used to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it does provide insight into how deep learning techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are applied to plant biodiversity and plant cover studies.

Randomness in deep learning pipelines often comes from various sources, including weight initialization, batch selection during training, dropout regularization, and even hardware-level noise. To manage this randomness, several strategies are commonly employed:

1. Seed setting: Setting a fixed seed value ensures reproducibility by initializing all random processes with the same starting point. This helps in reproducing results across different runs and platforms.

2. Model ensembling: Training multiple instances of the same model with different seeds and combining their outputs can help reduce variance due to randomness. This technique, known as model ensembling, often leads to improved performance and robustness.

3. Hyperparameter tuning: Random search or grid search methods can be used to find optimal hyperparameters, which may include parameters related to handling randomness, such as dropout rates or learning rate schedules.

4. Data augmentation: Applying random transformations to input data during training can increase the dataset size and improve generalization. By introducing controlled randomness via data augmentation, models become more resistant to variations in the input space.
