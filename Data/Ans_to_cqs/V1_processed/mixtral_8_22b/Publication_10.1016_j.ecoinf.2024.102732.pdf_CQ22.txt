Based on the given context, there isn't any specific information about the use of deep learning models or their evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall. However, the text does mention several performance evaluation metrics for other types of machine learning models like Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Regression (SVR).

For instance, the paper discusses using R-squared values to demonstrate how well the RF model fits the data. Additionally, they also provide Root Mean Absolute Error (RMAE) and Root Relative Mean Square Error (RRMSE) as indicators of the model's error reduction performance. These metrics can be considered analogous to accuracy, precision, and recall in evaluating classification tasks but are more suitable for regression problems.

Moreover, when discussing the optimization of hyperparameters for the RF model, the authors mention parameters like max\_depth, eta, and n\_estimators. Similarly, for SVR tuning, they talk about selecting appropriate kernel functions and optimizing the 'C' parameter. While these aren't directly related to the requested evaluation metrics, they do highlight important aspects of improving model performance.

Therefore, based on the available context, we cannot provide direct information regarding the evaluation metrics used for deep learning models. Instead, we have discussed the relevant performance evaluation metrics mentioned for other machine learning algorithms within this study.
