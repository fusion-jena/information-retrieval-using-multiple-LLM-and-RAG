The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using mean cross-validation (CV) accuracy and final training accuracy. This can be seen in Table 5, where various classifiers such as SVM:Lineard, SVM:Linear, SVM:RBFd, SVM:RBF, and CNN were tested with different hyperparameters. The mean CV accuracy and final training accuracy are reported for each set of images and classifier combination. Additionally, the table includes information about the illumination patterns, which may also impact the model performance. However, the specifics of how these metrics are calculated or used to adjust the models during training are not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
