Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models discussed in the paper. Typically, deep learning models can be trained using various types of hardware resources such as CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs. However, without further information about the specific implementation details of the proposed Intuitionistic Fuzzy Transfer Learning (IFTL) method, it is not possible to determine exactly what type of hardware was used for training the deep learning models in this case.
