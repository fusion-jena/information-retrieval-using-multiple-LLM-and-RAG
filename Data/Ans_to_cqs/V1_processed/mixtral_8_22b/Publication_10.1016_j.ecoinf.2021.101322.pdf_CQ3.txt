Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, considering that the study uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image analysis, it can be assumed that some form of image annotation technique has been employed. Common image annotation techniques include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. Without further details, it cannot be determined which specific method(s) were utilized in this case.
