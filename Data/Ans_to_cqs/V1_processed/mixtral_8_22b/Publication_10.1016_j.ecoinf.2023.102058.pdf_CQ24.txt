The context does not provide specific information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or setting random seed values. However, some common strategies to manage randomness include fixing the random seed value before training models, which ensures reproducibility by generating the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers each time the code is run. Another strategy involves performing multiple runs with different initializations and averaging the results to reduce variability caused by random initialization. Additionally, techniques such as cross-validation and bootstrapping can help assess the robustness of models against variations due to random sampling.
