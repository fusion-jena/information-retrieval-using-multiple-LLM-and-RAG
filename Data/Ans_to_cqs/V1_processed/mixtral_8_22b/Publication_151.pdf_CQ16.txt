The training process is stopped when the value of the loss function fails to decrease in two consecutive checks. These checks are performed every 50 epochs. This means that if the loss function does not improve over two consecutive checks (which occur every 50 epochs), the training process is halted. The model with the optimal objective function value is then selected. It should be noted that the choices of hyperparameters and training parameters were based on preselected values that were not fine-tuned on any dataset. Instead, they were chosen due to computational reasons during extensive simulations. When applying this methodology in practice on real data, it is possible to fine-tune all the hyperparameters using a validation set.
