The purpose of the deep learning model used in this study is primarily for classification tasks. Specifically, the researchers employed three types of classifiers - Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) - to categorize various input datasets into either seven classes (7C) or thirteen classes (13C). This resulted in a total of sixty models being generated from the classifications. The primary goal of these classifications appears to be improving environmental modeling through enhanced identification and understanding of plant populations within specific ecosystems.
