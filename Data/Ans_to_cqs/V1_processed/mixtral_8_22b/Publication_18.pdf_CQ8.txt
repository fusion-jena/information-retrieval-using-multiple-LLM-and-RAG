The given context does not explicitly mention where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer to the query. However, considering the nature of scientific research publications, it is common practice to share code repositories along with the publication or upon request from the authors. The best course of action would be to contact the corresponding author(s) of the paper to ask about the availability of the code repository.

If the article was published recently, there might also be a chance that the code repository has been made publicly available on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. To find out if this is the case, one could look up the title of the article or the names of the authors on those platforms. But without more information, I can only suggest these possibilities rather than providing a definitive answer.
