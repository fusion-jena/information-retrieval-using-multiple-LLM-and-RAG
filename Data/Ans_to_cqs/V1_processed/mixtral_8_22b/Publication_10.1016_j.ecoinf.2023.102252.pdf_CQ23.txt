Unfortunately, based on the given context, there isn't enough information to determine what specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context does not provide details about any deep learning models or their development process. Therefore, it cannot be determined if diverse datasets, cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other methods were employed to improve the model's generalizability.
