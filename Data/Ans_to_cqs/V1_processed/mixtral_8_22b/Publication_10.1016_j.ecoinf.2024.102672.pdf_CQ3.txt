Unfortunately, the provided context does not contain any information regarding data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide some general insights into common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. These include:

1. Bounding Box Annotation: This technique involves drawing boxes around objects within images to identify their location. It is commonly used for object detection tasks.

2. Semantic Segmentation: This technique involves labeling every pixel in an image according to the class of the object to which it belongs. It is often used for scene understanding tasks.

3. Instance Segmentation: Similar to semantic segmentation, but instead of grouping pixels belonging to the same class, it groups pixels belonging to specific instances of classes. For example, if there are multiple cars in an image, instance segmentation would distinguish between individual cars rather than treating all cars as a single entity.

4. Landmark Annotation: This technique involves identifying key points on objects within images. It is often used for facial recognition tasks.

5. Polygon Annotation: This technique involves drawing polygonal shapes around objects within images. It is useful when dealing with irregularly shaped objects.
