The paper does not explicitly discuss any specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some common practices used in deep learning models include setting fixed seeds for reproducible results or averaging multiple runs with different initializations to mitigate the effects of randomness. These techniques help ensure consistent performance across various stages of the deep learning process.

Based on the information given, there is no direct mention of how the authors handled randomness in their proposed model, SeedNet. Therefore, one cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the strategies employed to manage randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
