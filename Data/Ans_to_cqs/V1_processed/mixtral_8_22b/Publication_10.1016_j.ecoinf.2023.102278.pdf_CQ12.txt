In this study, the authors use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as their primary deep learning model. Specifically, they employ two types of CNN architectures - ResNet50 and EfficientNetB3. These models have been modified for multitask learning (MTL) and utilize transfer learning with pre-trained weights from ImageNet. Additionally, the authors mention modifying the ResNet50 architecture and training it with transfer learning using pre-trained weights from ImageNet. Therefore, the main deep learning models used in this pipeline are CNNs, specifically ResNet50 and EfficientNetB3.
