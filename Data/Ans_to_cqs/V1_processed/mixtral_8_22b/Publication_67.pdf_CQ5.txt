The study uses five custom datasets created specifically for this research. These datasets contain examples of images with different levels of tree cover, both continuous and discrete approximations, and include an auxiliary class called "Non-Forest." The datasets were designed for training convolutional neural network (CNN)-based models, particularly Inception v.3. Data augmentation was employed to improve the performance of these models. However, no specific mention is made of commonly known datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
