The deep learning models developed in this study use segmented images as their primary data format. These images are created by dividing larger images into smaller segments or grids, each containing 9 pixels. The segmentation process involves iteratively moving a window pixel-by-pixel across the original image. The resulting segmented images serve as inputs to the deep learning models, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The CNN model uses these segmented images to extract features and perform tasks such as image recognition, while the LSTM model processes sequential data, including time series signals from the segmented images. Therefore, the main data format utilized in this deep learning pipeline is segmented images.
