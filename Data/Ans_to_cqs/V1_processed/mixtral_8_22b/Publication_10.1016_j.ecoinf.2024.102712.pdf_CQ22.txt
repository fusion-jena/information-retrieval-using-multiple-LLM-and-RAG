Based on the given context, it appears that the evaluation of the model performance does not explicitly mention any specific metric such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., which are commonly used in evaluating deep learning models. Instead, the text mentions that they utilized the Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) approach to evaluate the model performance. This approach involves removing one observation from the dataset, training the model on the remaining observations, and then testing the model on the removed observation. This process is repeated until each observation has been left out once. While this approach can provide insights into the model's ability to generalize to new data, it does not directly measure traditional classification metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, etc. Therefore, without additional information, it cannot be definitively stated what metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model.
