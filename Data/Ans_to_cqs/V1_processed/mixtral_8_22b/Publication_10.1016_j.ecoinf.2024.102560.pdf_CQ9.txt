Unfortunately, there is no information about the availability or location of the deep learning pipeline data repository in the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to where it might be located.

Based on the provided context, we only have information regarding the use of different satellite-based datasets such as MODIS, CMAP, and Landsat for drought monitoring and land cover variation assessment in a specific basin. Additionally, the context mentions the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform for extracting MODIS datasets and NOAA repository for obtaining CMAP datasets. However, there is no mention of any deep learning pipeline or its corresponding data repository.
