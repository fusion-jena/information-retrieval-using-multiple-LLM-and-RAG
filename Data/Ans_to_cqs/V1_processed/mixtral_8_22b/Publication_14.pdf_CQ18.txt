To monitor the model performance during training, the author extracted feature vectors for the frozen layers in parallel using Google Cloud DataFlow. This was done to reduce training time. These features were then used as the basis for retraining the new fine-tuned layers. Additionally, the author mentions collecting images for each class and training with a batch size of 100 for 20,000 steps. However, it should be noted that the text does not explicitly state any specific strategies for monitoring the model performance during training beyond these details.
