To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, a diverse dataset was used, consisting of various plant traits such as leaf area, growth height, specific leaf area, leaf nitrogen concentration, seed mass, and stem specific density. Secondly, a random sample of 10% of the dataset of each trait was extracted before model training, serving as a 'test dataset'. This test dataset was not involved in the training process and was exclusively used for the independent evaluation of the trained models. Thirdly, the remaining data was split into 'training dataset' and 'validation dataset' by a ratio of 4:1. The training dataset was employed to train the weights of the CNN model, whereas the validation dataset indicated the training progress after each full training cycle ('epoch'). Fourthly, a contextual constraint was applied by feeding bioclimatic data into the CNN with the same model and data configuration. Lastly, a 3-fold cross-validation was performed, with three different training, validation, and test splits. This enabled a comparison of model performance across traits, and the resulting mean absolute error (MAE) was normalized by division over the range of the target values of the respective test dataset.
