To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the study utilized a diverse dataset consisting of two independent validation datasets - ABMI plots and CCMEO. These datasets likely contained various types of wetlands and uplands, which helped improve the robustness of the model. Secondly, the study employed two different machine learning approaches - convolutional neural networks (CNN) and XGBoost (XGB) - to predict wetland classes and upland habitats across a large region. Comparing these two approaches allowed for a more comprehensive evaluation of their performance and generalizability. Lastly, the study performed model validation using multiple statistical metrics, including overall accuracy, Kappa statistic, and mean F1-score. By evaluating the model based on these metrics, the researchers could assess its performance and reliability across different scenarios. However, the specific details regarding cross-validation or stratified splitting techniques used in this study are not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
