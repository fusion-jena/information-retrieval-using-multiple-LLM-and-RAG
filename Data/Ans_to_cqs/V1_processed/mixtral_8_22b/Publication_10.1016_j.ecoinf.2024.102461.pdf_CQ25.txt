The purpose of the deep learning model in the context provided is not explicitly stated. However, based on the information given, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is likely being used for classification purposes. This is because the text mentions the use of various machine learning algorithms, including deep learning, to refine fire risk maps. These maps are then classified into four categories - low, medium, high, and extreme - using Jenks' natural breaks classification method. Therefore, it can be assumed that the deep learning model is being utilized to aid in the classification process of creating accurate fire risk maps.
