The text does not provide information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate response based solely on the given context. However, common practices often involve splitting the dataset into three subsets: training set, validation set, and testing set. The training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set helps tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Lastly, the testing set evaluates the final performance of the trained model. The proportion of these sets varies depending on the size of the dataset and the problem complexity. Typically, researchers use 80% of the data for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing.
