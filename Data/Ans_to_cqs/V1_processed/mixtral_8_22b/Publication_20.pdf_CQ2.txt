Based on the provided context, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images. Specifically, the study uses a GoogLeNet architecture, which is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed for image classification tasks. The authors mention using a raw training dataset of 20 fish species, where each individual fish has corresponding thumbnail images. These images were then manipulated to create additional training data by flipping them along the vertical axis. Therefore, the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is images.
