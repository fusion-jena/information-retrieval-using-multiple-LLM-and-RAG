To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken during the training process. Firstly, the dataset was divided into two parts - 70% for training and the remaining 30% for validation. This approach helps prevent overfitting and allows the model to learn from diverse data points. Secondly, the training set was enhanced using various techniques such as flipping the images and labels along the X or Y axis, exchanging between multiple image channels, randomly rotating the images and labels by 90 degrees, and randomly adding noise to the images while keeping the labels unchanged. These methods help increase the diversity of the training data and improve the robustness of the model. Lastly, the ReduceLROnPlateau method was employed to adjust the learning rate based on the performance of the validation loss. This technique ensures that the model continues to learn effectively even when the initial learning rate might be too high or low. Overall, these measures contribute to improving the generalization ability of the deep learning model.
