The deep learning pipeline utilizes various methods for collecting raw data. These include monitoring networks, satellite images, weather data, and environmental elements. Monitoring networks provide weekly data with a granularity of monitoring tasks over 100 km^2 granules. Satellite images offer data every 2-3 days with a granularity of 25 km^2 cells. Weather data is collected daily, focusing on specific environmental elements. Lastly, environmental elements are monitored yearly. The providers for these data sources are CASE, ESA, ARPAE, and CER respectively. The raw data is stored in the Raw tier using the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), Apache HBase, and PostgreSQL RDBMS.
