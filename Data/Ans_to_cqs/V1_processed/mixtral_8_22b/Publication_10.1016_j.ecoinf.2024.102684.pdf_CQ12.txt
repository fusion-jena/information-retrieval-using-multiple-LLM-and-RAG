The text does not explicitly mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it does refer to "pre-trained networks" and "convolutional layers," suggesting that a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) might have been employed. Additionally, the phrase "fully connected network architecture" indicates the use of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) after the convolutional layers. Therefore, based on this context, it appears that a combination of CNN and MLP was utilized in the pipeline.
