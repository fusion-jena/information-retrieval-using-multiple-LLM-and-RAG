The document does not provide explicit information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. However, it mentions that a convolutional neural network (CNN) was employed for image classification tasks and that transfer learning was applied using pre-trained models such as VGG16 and ResNet50. These details suggest that common hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and optimizers were likely considered during training. Unfortunately, without more specific information, we cannot determine the exact values or types of these hyperparameters.
