To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed. One common approach is to use fixed random seeds for reproducibility. By setting a specific seed value, the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers will be generated, ensuring consistent results across different runs or experiments. This technique is particularly useful when comparing model performance under identical conditions.

Another strategy involves averaging multiple runs with different initializations. Since neural networks often converge to local minima during optimization, running the model multiple times with varying starting points can help explore the solution space more thoroughly. Taking the average of these runs may lead to better overall performance by mitigating the impact of any single initialization.

Additionally, techniques such as dropout regularization and batch normalization can also aid in managing randomness. Dropout randomly drops out neurons during training, which helps prevent overfitting and encourages the network to learn more robust features. Batch normalization standardizes inputs within mini-batches, reducing internal covariate shift and improving convergence rates. Both methods introduce controlled randomness into the learning process, ultimately contributing to improved generalization capabilities.
