To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, a large dataset was prepared using a partial training method where the model was initially trained on existing data and then used to annotate new data before further training. This resulted in a large dataset containing 540 training images and 141 validation images. Secondly, the dataset was manually checked and edited by a human to maintain its quality. Thirdly, due to the poor image quality of the Kenyan data, a separate smaller dataset consisting solely of Kenyan images was created to fine-tune the model specifically for this data. These steps helped improve the robustness and adaptability of the model across different datasets.
