The authors do not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps taken after model training. However, based on the information given, it can be inferred that some form of visualization was performed, as indicated by the involvement of Frederick Kistner and Larissa Slaney in 'Visualization'. Additionally, the authors discuss comparing 185 model outputs in the first experiment and analyzing 37 FIT runs per species, which suggests they may have calculated metrics or evaluated their models using confusion matrices. Nevertheless, without explicit confirmation, these assumptions remain speculative.
