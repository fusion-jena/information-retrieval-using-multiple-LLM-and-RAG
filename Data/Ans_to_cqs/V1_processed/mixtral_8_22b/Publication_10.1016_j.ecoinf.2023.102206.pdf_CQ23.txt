To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures have been taken. Firstly, well-known benchmark datasets are utilized for evaluating the performance of machine learning algorithms. These datasets are then partitioned into test data (target domain) and training data (source domain) using methods such as KFold or StratifiedKFold. This ensures that both domains are drawn from the same domain distribution, making them equal in their distribution.

However, to evaluate the performance of IFTL (Instance-based Feature Transfer Learning), it is hypothesized for transfer learning, and the source domain (target domain) must be highly diverse but related. Therefore, Ds ≠ Dt or Ts ≠ Tt or both. To achieve this diversity, multiple layers are generated that learn with their pluralism, simultaneously. This allows the model to learn the corresponding distributions on different layers.

Additionally, a small sample of the target domain is used as a seed to transform the source domain dataset. Data augmentation techniques are also employed for wildfire detection to overcome data limitations. These measures help to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model by allowing it to handle diverse datasets and learn from them effectively.
