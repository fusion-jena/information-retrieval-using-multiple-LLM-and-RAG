The study utilizes various sources for collecting raw data in its deep learning pipeline. For tsetse density data, it employs innovative solutions from Decision Agriculture (Hengl et al., 2021), which likely involves using advanced technologies such as remote sensing or satellite imagery. Additionally, the study uses WorldPop data (<https://www.worldpop.org/>), which provides population estimates based on census data and other geospatial information. The TerraClimate dataset (Abatzoglou et al., 2018) is also used, providing climate variables derived from weather stations and remotely sensed data. Furthermore, the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station Data (Funk et al., 2015) is employed, offering precipitation estimates based on satellite observations and ground measurements. Lastly, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data is incorporated into the analysis, which captures land surface temperature and vegetation indices through satellite imagery. Overall, these diverse data sources enable the study to gather comprehensive and accurate information for its deep learning models.
