The information provided does not explicitly mention where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, since the study utilizes Google Earth Engine (GEE) for retrieving atmospherically corrected United States Geological Survey Landsat Surface reflectance products, it can be assumed that the data used in the study might be accessible through the GEE platform itself. Nevertheless, without explicit information about the availability of the deep learning pipeline's data repository, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding its location on platforms like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
