Based on the provided context, there isn't any explicit mention of how the hyperparameters of the ResNet50V2 model were optimized, such as through methods like grid search or random search. However, we do know that the validation set was used for monitoring the performance of the network during training and for comparing the performance of different networks with varying hyperparameters or network structures. This suggests that some form of hyperparameter tuning was likely employed, but without further details, we cannot definitively state which specific method was used.
