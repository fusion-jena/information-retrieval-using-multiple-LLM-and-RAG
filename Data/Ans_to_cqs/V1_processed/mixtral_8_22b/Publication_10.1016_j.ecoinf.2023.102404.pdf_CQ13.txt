Based on the given information, it appears that the study does not involve a deep learning model but rather focuses on a Random Forest (RF) regression algorithm for creating a 10m Canopy Height Model (CHM) and Aboveground Biomass (AGB) map of New York for 2019. Therefore, there is no mention of hyperparameters specific to deep learning models such as learning rates or optimizers. However, the study discusses the optimization of hyperparameters for the RF model, which includes 'numberOfTrees','minLeafPopulation', 'bagFraction', and'seed'. These hyperparameters are crucial for achieving the desired balance between model complexity and predictive performance. The 'numberOfTrees' represents the number of decision trees in the ensemble, while'minLeafPopulation' determines the minimum number of samples required to form a leaf node in each tree. The 'bagFraction' indicates the proportion of the training dataset used to train each individual tree, and the'seed' is a random number seed used to ensure reproducibility. Through a grid search approach, the researchers exhaustively tested various combinations of these hyperparameters and selected those that yielded the most stable and reliable results, aiming to minimize the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for enhanced accuracy in their regression task.
