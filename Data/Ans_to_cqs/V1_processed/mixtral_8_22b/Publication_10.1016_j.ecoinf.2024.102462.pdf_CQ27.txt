The text does not explicitly mention the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. However, based on common practices in deep learning projects, after training the model, it would typically be saved or serialized so that it can be loaded and used for predictions. The deployment platform could vary depending on the project requirements, but popular choices include cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure, or local servers. Additionally, the model might need further optimizations for production use, such as quantization or pruning, which are not mentioned in the given context.
