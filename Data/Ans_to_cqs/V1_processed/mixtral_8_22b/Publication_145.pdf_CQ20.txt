The deep learning model was trained using the GPU of an Nvidia RTX2080 graphics card with 8 GB of dedicated memory. This information can be found in section 3.7 Algorithm of the given context. It states that the model was coded in the programming language R with RStudio interface to Keras and TensorFlow backend. Furthermore, it mentions that the training of the models took ~2--20 hours using the mentioned GPU. Therefore, we can conclude that the hardware resource used for training the deep learning model is the GPU of an Nvidia RTX2080 graphics card with 8 GB of dedicated memory.
