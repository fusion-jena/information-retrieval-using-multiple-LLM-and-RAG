The sources provided do not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipelines. However, they do provide some clues about possible data types. For instance, one source mentions the application of deep learning in image-based species identification [1]. This suggests that images could be one type of input data format used in such pipelines. Another study discusses applications of deep learning in ecology, which might involve various data types like text, numerical data, or even geospatial data [2]. Yet another paper focuses on predicting climate change effects on truffle cultivation potential, implying that time series or other forms of temporal data may also play a role in these analyses [3]. While it isn't specified what exact data formats were employed across all studies, we can infer from their respective topics that images, text, numerical data, and possibly spatial or temporal datasets could have been utilized within the deep learning pipelines.
