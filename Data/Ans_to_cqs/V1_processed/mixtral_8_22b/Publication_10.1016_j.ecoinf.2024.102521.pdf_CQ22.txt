The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics such as bounding box precision and recall. Bounding box precision refers to the fraction of insect-containing bounding boxes among all bounding boxes returned by the algorithm. Recall, on the other hand, represents the proportion of all insects that were identified by the algorithm. In this case, each point in Figure 4 represents an average precision of a 0.04 recall range. The precision for objects detected with a high (>0.98) confidence score is high, and it drops for objects detected with lower confidence (<0.90). However, at the highest recall values, the confidence score is almost 0. This failure to reach higher recall is attributed to the identification of very close insects as a single entity.
