Unfortunately, there is no information provided about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. In the given context, only the process of generating a tabulated dataset, including on-field AGB and independent features, is mentioned. However, it does not specify any details regarding the availability of this dataset in public repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this query.
