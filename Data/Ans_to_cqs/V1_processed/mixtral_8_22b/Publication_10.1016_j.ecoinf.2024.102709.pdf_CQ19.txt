Based on the given information, it is not explicitly stated which deep learning frameworks were used to build the models. However, there is mention of functions from the Python library scikit-learn being used to split the data and investigate the results of each trained model. Additionally, the YOLO loss function is mentioned, suggesting that the You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection algorithm may have been employed. Nevertheless, without explicit mention of deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, it cannot be definitively determined which frameworks were utilized.
