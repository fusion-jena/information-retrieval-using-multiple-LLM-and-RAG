In the given context, the dataset was divided in a ratio of 75:25 into a training set and a test set. Specifically, there were 5789 images used for training and 1930 images used for testing. This division of data is a common practice in machine learning and deep learning projects. Typically, the larger portion of the data is allocated for training purposes, while a smaller subset is reserved for testing or validating the model's performance. In some cases, another small portion of the data may also be separated out for validation during the training process. However, in this particular scenario, only two sets of data were mentioned - one for training and one for testing.
