Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that hyperparameter optimization was performed using both the random grid search and Bayesian optimization methods, which were implemented using GridSearchCV from Scikit-learn and the Hyperopt library (version 0.2.7). This could potentially contribute to improving the model's generalization capabilities. Additionally, the fact that all algorithms were evaluated using the same dataset suggests that some form of standardized evaluation or validation might have been used to assess the model's performance across different datasets. Nevertheless, without more detailed information about the exact steps taken to evaluate and validate the deep learning model, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer regarding the specific measures used to ensure its generalizability.
