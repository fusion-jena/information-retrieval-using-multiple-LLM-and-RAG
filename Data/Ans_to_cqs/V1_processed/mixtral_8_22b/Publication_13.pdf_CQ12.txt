A convolutional neural network (CNN) is used in the pipeline for this study. This can be seen in several places throughout the given text. For example, when discussing the between-dataset classification, it mentions that "the CNN model was trained with a source dataset." Additionally, when describing the effects of datasets and the number of images, it states that "the CNN model was trained with N images randomly selected from the dataset." Furthermore, Figure 2 also refers to a CNN architecture. Therefore, based on these references, we can conclude that a CNN is being utilized in this research.
