The text does not explicitly mention which datasets were used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the performance of the networks was influenced by the similarity between the datasets used to fine-tune them and evaluate them. It also states that ImageNet, which contains over 1.2 million annotated images across 1000 object classes, was used as a benchmark for evaluating new algorithms. Therefore, it can be inferred that ImageNet might have been used in their deep learning pipeline.
