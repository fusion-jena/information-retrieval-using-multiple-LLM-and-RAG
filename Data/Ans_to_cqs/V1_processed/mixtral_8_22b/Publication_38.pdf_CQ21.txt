Unfortunately, based on the given context, there isn't enough information to provide a detailed explanation about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, generally speaking, common postprocessing steps include generating saliency maps to understand what parts of the input data the model focuses on, calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score to evaluate the performance of the model, and creating confusion matrices to visualize the performance of the model across different classes. These steps may vary depending on the specific requirements and goals of the project.
