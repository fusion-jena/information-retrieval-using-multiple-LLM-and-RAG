Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide a detailed answer about the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the authors used a combination of ResNet-50 and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a cubic polynomial kernel for classification. They also mentioned using a 10-fold cross-validation to define the score-to-posterior-probability transformation function. Based on this information, we can assume that they might have serialized the trained model and deployed it on a suitable platform for further analysis or real-time predictions. But without explicit details regarding the deployment process, it remains speculative.
