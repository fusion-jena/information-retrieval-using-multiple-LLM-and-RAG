The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a combination of grid search and random search methods. Grid search involves specifying a set of values for each hyperparameter and then training the model with every possible combination of these values. Random search, on the other hand, randomly selects combinations of hyperparameter values within specified ranges and trains the model with those combinations. Both methods aim to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters that results in the best performance of the model. In this study, both grid search and random search were used to optimize the hyperparameters of the deep learning models. However, it is not explicitly stated which specific hyperparameters were optimized or what their final values were.
