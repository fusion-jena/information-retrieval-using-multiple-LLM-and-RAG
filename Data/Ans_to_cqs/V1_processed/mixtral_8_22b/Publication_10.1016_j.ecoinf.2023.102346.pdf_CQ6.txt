Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be applied to improve its performance. These may include data cleaning, where missing or irrelevant data is removed or replaced. Normalization and scaling techniques such as min-max scaling or z-score standardization can also be employed to ensure all input features have similar scales, preventing any single feature from dominating the others during training. Additionally, encoding categorical variables into numerical form might be necessary if they cannot be directly fed into the model. Lastly, splitting the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets allows for better evaluation of the model's generalization capabilities. However, it should be noted that these specific preprocessing steps are not explicitly mentioned within the given context.
