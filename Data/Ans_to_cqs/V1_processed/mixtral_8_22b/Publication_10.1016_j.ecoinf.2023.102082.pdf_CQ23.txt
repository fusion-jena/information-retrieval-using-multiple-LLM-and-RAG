To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the model was trained on a diverse dataset consisting of Sentinel-2 optical images from different locations, specifically 30 forest plots in the northern Italian Alps and 100 plots in the forested area of Traunstein, Germany. This helped to expose the model to various environmental conditions and landscapes, improving its ability to generalize well to unseen data. Secondly, a cross-validation analysis was performed using all 130 plots. Cross-validation is a technique used to evaluate machine learning models by partitioning the original sample into a training set and a validation set. By repeating this process multiple times, it provides a robust assessment of how well the model will perform on new, unseen data. Lastly, forest density information was incorporated as an influencing factor in a multiple regression analysis. Including relevant features like forest density helps improve the model's performance and ensures that it can accurately predict outcomes across varying forest densities. These combined efforts aimed to create a reliable and accurate deep learning model capable of estimating tree species diversity based on high-resolution CHMs derived from Sentinel-2 imagery.
