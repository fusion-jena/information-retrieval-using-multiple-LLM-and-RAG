The data was split into three exclusive groups for deep learning model training: 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing. This division allows the model to learn patterns from the majority of the data during training while also providing separate sets for tuning hyperparameters (validation) and evaluating the final model performance (testing). The specific method used to divide the data was stratified sampling, which ensures that each subset maintains the same distribution of classes as the original dataset.
