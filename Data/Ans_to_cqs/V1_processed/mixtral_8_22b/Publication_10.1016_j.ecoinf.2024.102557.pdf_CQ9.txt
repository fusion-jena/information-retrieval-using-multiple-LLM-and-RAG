The information provided does not explicitly mention where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it can be assumed that the data used in the research might have been sourced from various databases mentioned in the references, including Mediterranean forest ecosystems, which is stated to be the most extensive database of macrofungal productivity in the world. Additionally, there are mentions of other studies related to applications of deep learning in ecology, individual-scale variation, species-scale differences, and predicted climate change impacts on truffle cultivation potential in Central Europe. It is recommended to refer to these sources or contact the authors directly for further clarification regarding the availability of the data repository.
