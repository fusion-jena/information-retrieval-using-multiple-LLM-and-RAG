The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is mentioned in the first paragraph of the given context, where it states that CNNs are commonly used for extracting image features and describes how they work. Additionally, the mention of transfer learning using pre-trained weights from the ImageNet dataset further supports this, as ImageNet is often used for pre-training CNN models.
