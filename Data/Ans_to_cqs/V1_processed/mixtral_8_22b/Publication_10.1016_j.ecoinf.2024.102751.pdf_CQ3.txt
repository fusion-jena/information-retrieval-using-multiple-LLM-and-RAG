Unfortunately, there is no information available regarding the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline within the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based solely on the provided references and text snippets. However, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines can include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, line annotation, and keypoint annotation. These techniques help train models to recognize objects, classify pixels, identify instances, draw shapes around objects, label lines, and locate important points respectively.
