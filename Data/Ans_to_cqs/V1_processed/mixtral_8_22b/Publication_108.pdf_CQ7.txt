Based on the given context, there is no explicit information about how the data was split for deep learning model training (train, test, validation). However, it can be inferred from the statement "These experiments were monitored using TensorBoard and validated on the validation portion of the dataset" that the dataset was indeed divided into at least two portions - one for training and another for validation. Typically, datasets are also further divided into a testing set to evaluate the final performance of the trained model. Common methods for splitting the data include random sampling or stratified sampling based on the distribution of classes in the dataset. Without additional context, it cannot be determined which method was used in this case.
