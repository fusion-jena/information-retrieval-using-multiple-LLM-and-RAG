The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics such as model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Model accuracy is calculated as the number of correct predictions divided by the total number of images. Precision is calculated as the ratio of true positive predictions to the sum of true positive and false positive predictions. Recall is calculated as the ratio of true positive predictions to the sum of true positive and false negative predictions. The F1 score is calculated as the harmonic mean of precision and recall. These metrics are used to assess the performance of the model on both the validation dataset and the out-of-sample test dataset.
