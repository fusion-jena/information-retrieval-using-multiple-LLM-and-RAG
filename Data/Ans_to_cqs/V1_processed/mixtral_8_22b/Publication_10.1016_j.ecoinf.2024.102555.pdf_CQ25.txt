The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, based on the title of one of the cited papers ("Verification of novel integrations of swarm intelligence algorithms into deep learning neural network for flood susceptibility mapping"), it can be inferred that the deep learning model was used for flood susceptibility mapping. This suggests that the model might have been designed for a classification task, where it classifies different areas based on their susceptibility to flooding. Nevertheless, without more specific information about the architecture or training process of the model, we cannot definitively determine whether it was used solely for classification purposes or if it also incorporated other tasks such as object detection or semantic segmentation.
