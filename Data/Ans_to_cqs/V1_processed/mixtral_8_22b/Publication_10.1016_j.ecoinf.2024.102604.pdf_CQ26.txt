The text does not provide explicit information on specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it discusses several methods for addressing sampling biases in ecological datasets, which can also apply to general machine learning pipelines. These include the aggregation background method, geographic filtering, the similarity background method, and others mentioned in Section 4.3. The aggregation background method appears to perform well for both OS and RD biases with smaller sample sizes, while geographic filtering and the similarity background method show good performance for larger sample sizes. It should be noted that these methods focus on correcting biases related to environmental variables rather than class imbalance or diversity issues typically addressed using techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.
