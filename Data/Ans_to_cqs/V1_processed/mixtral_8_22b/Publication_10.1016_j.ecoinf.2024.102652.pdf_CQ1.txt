In this study, the authors utilize two main sources of raw data collection for their deep learning pipeline: in-situ Electrical Conductivity (EC) measurements and remote sensing data.

For in-situ EC measurements, they employ a Veris 3100 Soil EC mapping system, which uses electromagnetic induction technology to measure soil conductivity. This device collects real-time EC readings while being towed across the field by a tractor or other vehicle. These measurements provide valuable information about soil salinity levels, which can be used to create detailed maps of affected areas.

On the other hand, remote sensing data is obtained from satellite imagery. Specifically, the researchers use multispectral images captured by the WorldView-2 satellite. Multispectral images contain multiple bands of light, including visible and near-infrared wavelengths, which can reveal important characteristics of the land surface such as vegetation health and moisture content. By analyzing these images alongside the in-situ EC measurements, the team can develop more accurate models of soil salinity distribution.

Overall, both in-situ EC measurements and remote sensing data play crucial roles in providing comprehensive input data for the deep learning pipeline. While the former offers direct observations of soil properties, the latter provides broader spatial coverage and additional contextual information that enhances model performance.
