The text does not explicitly state the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions data validation being performed on the captive Amur tiger dataset to determine the optimal number of footprint trails required for the algorithm training set and test sets that could provide an accurate population estimate. This suggests that the completeness of training might be determined by achieving an acceptable level of accuracy in predicting the population estimate based on the test set. Additionally, the use of holdback trials and iterative analysis for each combination of test/training size implies that stability or consistency in prediction outcomes may also play a role in determining when training is considered complete.
