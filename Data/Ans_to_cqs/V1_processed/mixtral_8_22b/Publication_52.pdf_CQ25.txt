The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the provided context is not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred from the description that the model is designed for clustering or classification tasks. The model is a multi-layered neural network that uses the unsupervised GRELMA algorithm as a building block, where the outputs of each level serve as inputs to the next one. Additionally, the model incorporates an autoencoder, which is a type of artificial neural network used for unsupervised learning of efficient coding. The goal of an autoencoder is to learn a representation for a set of data, with the output layer having the same number of nodes as the input layer, and with the purpose of reconstructing its own inputs rather than predicting a target value given inputs. Furthermore, the model aims to optimize the choice of input layer weights and biases to achieve a higher level of generalization. These characteristics suggest that the model is likely intended for classification or clustering tasks, although the specific application is not mentioned in the provided context.
