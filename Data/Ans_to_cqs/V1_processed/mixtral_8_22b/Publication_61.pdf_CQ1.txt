In the given context, the authors discuss building their own dataset due to the lack of previous information. They focus on the case study of the Tehuacán-Cuicatlán Valley in Mexico, which is an arid region surrounded by natural walls. However, they do not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.

Generally speaking, there are various methods for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines. These include:

1. Surveys: Data collection through surveys involves gathering information directly from individuals using structured questionnaires. This method is often employed when human input is required, such as labeling images or providing subjective opinions.

2. Sensors: Sensor data collection involves capturing real-world signals using devices like cameras, microphones, temperature sensors, etc. This type of data is commonly used in applications such as object detection, speech recognition, and weather forecasting.

3. Public datasets: Utilizing existing datasets available publicly is another common method for obtaining raw data. These datasets may contain labeled or unlabeled samples depending on the application. Examples of popular public datasets include ImageNet, CIFAR-10, MNIST, and COCO.

Based on the provided context, it appears that the authors might have collected their raw data using sensor data collection methods, specifically aerial images. However, without explicit confirmation, it remains uncertain what exact methods were used for collecting raw data in their deep learning pipeline.
