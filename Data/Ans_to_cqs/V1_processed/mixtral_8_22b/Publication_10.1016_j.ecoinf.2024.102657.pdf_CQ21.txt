The given context does not provide explicit information about any specific postprocessing steps taken after the model training. However, it can be inferred from the text that some form of metrics calculation is performed to evaluate the performance of the models. For instance, the accuracy of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was calculated after training it on both filtered and unfiltered data. Additionally, the mention of a confusion matrix isn't directly present in the context, but its use could be implied since it is a common method used to assess the performance of classification models like CNN and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN). Nevertheless, without further details, we cannot confirm if saliency maps or other postprocessing techniques were employed.
