The given context does not provide specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, based on the general knowledge of deep learning pipelines, these are common data annotation techniques used for various tasks.

Bounding Box Annotation involves drawing a rectangle around an object in an image to identify its location. This technique is commonly used in object detection tasks where the goal is to locate and classify objects within an image.

Instance Segmentation involves labeling each pixel in an image with a unique identifier to distinguish individual instances of objects. This technique is often used in applications such as autonomous driving, medical imaging, and satellite imagery analysis.

Other data annotation techniques include Semantic Segmentation, Polygon Annotation, Landmark Annotation, and Keypoint Annotation. These techniques are used depending on the specific requirements of the task and the type of data being analyzed.
