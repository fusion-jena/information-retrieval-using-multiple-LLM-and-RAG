Unfortunately, based on the given context, there isn't enough information to provide a detailed answer about the specific process used to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that the study employs feature optimization tools to refine the subsequent classification process. It also highlights the importance of having representative and adequate training samples for accurate classification models. But, it doesn't discuss any details regarding the deployment of the trained model such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this query with the available information.
