The given text does not provide any specific details about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotation, scaling, etc. However, it does mention several classical and deep learning-based methods for image enhancement.

In terms of classical image enhancement techniques, Qi et al. proposed SGUIENet which uses semantic information as input for region-wise feature learning in the enhancement process. This allows for better extraction of local features for enhancement, resulting in a consistent and superior enhancement. Huang et al. proposed a novel adaptive group attention (AGA) used to select complementary channels based on dependencies, reducing the number of parameters in attention. Furthermore, the proposed AGA is integrated with Swin Transformer for an end-to-end underwater image enhancement network. Cai et al. proposed a CURE-Net that systematically enhances image quality stepwise. The proposed model comprises three subnetworks, where the initial two subnetworks employ attention mechanisms and gate fusion to acquire comprehensive contextual features across multiple structures with an increasing number of output channels, encouraging the network to learn complex representations.

Regarding deep learning techniques, Li et al. developed WaterGAN deep learning-based generative adversarial network model that performs network training for reducing the color deviation in underwater images. Fabbri et al. developed UGAN by taking the idea of CycleGAN (Zhu et al.) that performs domain transformation to reconstruct degraded images. Guo et al. developed a novel multi-scale dense GAN by adding a residual multi-scale dense block to the generator, improving enhancement performance. Islam et al. presented FUnIE-GAN by introducing a multi-modal objective function in the generator.

However, none of these studies specifically mention the use of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, or scaling in their respective pipelines. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to your query based on the given context.
