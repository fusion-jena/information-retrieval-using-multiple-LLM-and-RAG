The text mentions that the most commonly used software implementing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is the open source library of Tensorflow by Google. This indicates that Tensorflow was used as the framework to build the deep learning model in this specific context. However, it should be noted that there are other popular frameworks like PyTorch, Keras, and Caffe that can also be used to build deep learning models.
