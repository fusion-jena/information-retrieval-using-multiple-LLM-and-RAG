The text does not provide explicit information on how the data was split for deep learning model training (train, test, validation sets). However, it mentions that seventy training sites in the form of points were selected for each of the five classes, making up a total of 350 points per image. These points were selected using a stratified (by class) random sampling approach and were distributed across the entire study area. This suggests that the data might have been randomly divided into training and testing datasets. Additionally, the use of a cluster classification map as a further guide for class selection implies that some form of cross-validation may have been employed during the training process. Nevertheless, without specific details regarding the splitting method, we cannot definitively state the exact criteria used to divide the data for deep learning model training.
