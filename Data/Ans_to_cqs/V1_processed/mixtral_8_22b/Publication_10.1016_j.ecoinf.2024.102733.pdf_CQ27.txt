Unfortunately, based on the given information, there isn't any specific detail about how the trained deep learning model was deployed. Deployment could involve processes such as model serialization, where the model is saved in a format that can be loaded later for use, or platform selection, where a suitable environment is chosen to run the model, among others. However, without explicit details regarding these steps, I cannot provide a precise answer.
