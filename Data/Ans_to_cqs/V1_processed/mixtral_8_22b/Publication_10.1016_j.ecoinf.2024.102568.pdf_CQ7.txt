Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about the exact criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into sets like train, test, or validation. However, there are some clues that suggest how the data was handled.

Firstly, the text mentions a training set and a test set. This implies that the data was divided into at least two parts - one for training the model and another for testing its performance. It also states that the number of observations in the training set is reported in the column "train size," which further supports the idea of having separate datasets for different purposes.

Secondly, the context discusses the use of a dropout layer as a regularization method to avoid overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns too much from the training data and performs poorly on unseen data. By adding a dropout layer, some inputs are excluded during training, preventing the model from relying too heavily on any single input. This suggests that the authors were aware of the importance of generalizing the model beyond the training data.

Lastly, the context refers to the performance of the LSTM model being evaluated against other methods, such as VR+SVR. Comparisons between these models indicate that they were likely tested on similar datasets to ensure fair evaluations.

While the context doesn't explicitly state the criteria used to split the data, it does imply that the data was separated into distinct subsets for training and testing purposes. Additionally, measures were taken to prevent overfitting and ensure the validity of comparisons between different models.
