The table provides information about various training parameters used in DeepLabV3+, but it does not explicitly mention any specific optimization technique such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, etc. However, we can infer that some form of optimization technique must have been employed during the training process since there are parameters like 'Learning Policy', 'Base Learning Rate', 'Learning Rate Decay Factor', 'Learning Power', 'Momentum', etc. These parameters are typically associated with optimization algorithms used in deep learning models. For instance, 'Learning Policy' might refer to the type of optimizer being used (like SGD, Adam, RMSprop, etc.), while 'Base Learning Rate' sets the initial learning rate for the optimizer. Similarly, 'Learning Rate Decay Factor' and 'Learning Rate Decay Step' control how the learning rate changes during training, and 'Momentum' is often used with SGD to help accelerate convergence by taking into account past gradients. Therefore, although the exact optimization algorithm isn't specified, based on these parameter names, it seems likely that some variant of stochastic gradient descent was utilized.
