Based on the given context, there isn't explicit mention of any specific preprocessing steps for training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, generally speaking, common preprocessing techniques used before training a deep learning model include:

1. Normalization: Scaling numerical values to a standard range like [0, 1] or [-1, 1]. This helps prevent certain features from dominating others due to their scale differences.

2. Standardization: Transforming data to have zero mean and unit variance. This technique is often applied when working with Gaussian distributions.

3. Cleaning: Removing missing or inconsistent data points, outliers, or duplicates to improve the overall quality of the dataset.

4. Encoding categorical variables: Converting non-numerical labels into numerical form so they can be processed by machine learning algorithms. Techniques include label encoding, one-hot encoding, and ordinal encoding.

5. Feature extraction/selection: Identifying relevant features that contribute most to the target variable and removing irrelevant ones to reduce dimensionality and computational complexity.
