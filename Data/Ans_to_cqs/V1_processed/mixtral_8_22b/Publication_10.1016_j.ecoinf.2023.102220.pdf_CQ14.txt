The text does not explicitly mention the specific optimization technique used for selecting the optimal hyperparameters for the model. However, it does indicate that the authors employed a process of optimization to improve their results significantly, even under stochastic conditions. This suggests that some form of hyperparameter tuning was performed, but without further information, it cannot be definitively stated whether techniques like grid search or random search were utilized.
