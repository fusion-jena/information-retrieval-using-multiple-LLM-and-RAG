Training completion is determined by several criteria, including the validation loss plateau. In this case, the three main Deep Neural Network (DNN) models were trained for 200 epochs. Epochs refer to one iteration where the entire dataset is passed both forward and backward through the neural network only once. After training these models, the one with the best accuracy was retained. This suggests that the training was considered complete when the desired level of accuracy was achieved or when no further improvement could be made within the specified number of epochs. Additionally, learning and loss curves were used to diagnose the learning performance of the models over time. These curves provide insights into how well the models are learning and generalizing, which can help determine whether more training is needed or not. Specifically, the validation accuracy and validation loss curves give information about the model's performance on new unseen data, indicating its ability to generalize. Therefore, a combination of factors such as achieving a certain level of accuracy, observing a plateau in validation loss, and evaluating learning and loss curves can be used to determine when training is complete.
