The given text does not provide direct information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it discusses various estimators like NN1, NN2, NN3, and NN4, which are used to reduce bias and improve accuracy in forest inventory analysis. These estimators consider different factors, including the weights of sample trees and their neighbors, to balance the weights and minimize bias.

For instance, the NN4 estimator, which takes into account the weights of both sample trees and their neighbors, has been found to perform better than the NN3 estimator in most cases. Similarly, the inventory estimator is recommended for certain indices like M and M'. In general, the choice of estimator depends on the specific application and desired outcome.

While the given text does not specifically mention techniques related to addressing data bias in deep learning pipelines, it highlights the importance of using appropriate estimators to mitigate bias and improve accuracy in data analysis.
