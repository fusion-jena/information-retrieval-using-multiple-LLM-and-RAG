Regularization is a technique used in machine learning and deep learning models to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. This helps to reduce the complexity of the model and improve its generalization performance. There are several regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline, including:

1. Dropout: Dropout is a regularization method where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training. This prevents complex co-adaptations between neurons and reduces overfitting. During each iteration of the training process, some neurons are temporarily removed or "dropped out" along with all their incoming and outgoing connections.

2. L2 Regularization: Also known as weight decay, this method adds a penalty term to the loss function equal to the sum of squares of all the weights in the model. This encourages smaller weights and simpler models, reducing overfitting.

3. Early Stopping: In early stopping, the training process is stopped when the validation error starts increasing instead of decreasing. This helps to avoid overfitting by preventing the model from memorizing the training data.

4. Data Augmentation: Data augmentation involves creating new training examples by applying transformations such as rotation, scaling, and flipping to existing images. This increases the diversity of the training dataset and improves the model's ability to generalize.

5. Ensemble Methods: Ensemble methods combine multiple models to produce better results than any single model alone. By combining different models trained on different subsets of the data, ensemble methods can reduce overfitting and improve generalization performance.

In summary, there are several regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline to prevent overfitting, including dropout, L2 regularization, early stopping, data augmentation, and ensemble methods. Each method has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of which method to use depends on the specific problem being solved and the available resources.
