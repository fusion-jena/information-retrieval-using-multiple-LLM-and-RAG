Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. However, it mentions that stochastic gradient descent is commonly used as the learning algorithm. This could imply that the learning rate might be one of the hyperparameters used in this case. Other common hyperparameters include batch size, number of epochs, weight decay, momentum, etc. But without further details, I cannot confirm which specific hyperparameters were used in their deep learning model.
