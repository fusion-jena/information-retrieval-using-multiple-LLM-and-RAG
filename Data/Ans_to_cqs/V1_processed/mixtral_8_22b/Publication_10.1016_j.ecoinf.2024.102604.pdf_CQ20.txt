The paper does not provide information on the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. It only mentions that the models were trained using TensorFlow, which can be run on various types of hardware such as CPUs, GPUs, or TPUs. However, without explicit mention of the hardware used, it cannot be determined what type was utilized in this particular case.
