The given context does not provide information about the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, some common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, shearing, and adding noise. These techniques help increase the size and diversity of training datasets, which can improve model performance and prevent overfitting. The choice of data augmentation technique depends on the nature of the problem and the dataset being used.
