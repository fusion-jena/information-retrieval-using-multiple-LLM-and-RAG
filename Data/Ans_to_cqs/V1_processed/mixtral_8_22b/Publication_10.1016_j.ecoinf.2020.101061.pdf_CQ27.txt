Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available in the given context to provide a detailed explanation about how the trained deep learning model was deployed. However, it can be assumed that after training the model with the hand-annotated data for 40 epochs, the final model would have been saved or serialized for later use. This could involve saving the model architecture along with its learned parameters into a file format such as.h5 (HDF5), which is commonly used for storing TensorFlow/Keras models. As for platform selection, it depends on where the model needs to be deployed - it could be a cloud service like AWS Sagemaker, Google Cloud AI Platform, Azure Machine Learning Studio, etc., or even on edge devices if real-time predictions are required. But without specific details regarding deployment, I cannot provide more precise information.
