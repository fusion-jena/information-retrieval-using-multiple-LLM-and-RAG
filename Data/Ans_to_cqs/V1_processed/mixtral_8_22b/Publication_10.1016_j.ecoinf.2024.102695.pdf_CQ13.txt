The deep learning model uses a learning rate of 0.0001 throughout the training process. An early stopping strategy is also employed, causing the training process to converge before the last epoch and preventing potential overfitting issues. Additionally, a dropout rate of 0.05 is applied during training. The model was trained for 300 epochs with 24 data instances processed per batch. However, the context does not provide information about the specific optimizer used in this case.
