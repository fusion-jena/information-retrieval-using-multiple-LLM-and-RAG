Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention what specific data format is being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer from the context that the data source might be related to geographical coordinates or spatial data since there are mentions of latitude and longitude values such as '21′N', '39 26′E', etc. Additionally, the context discusses the application of the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model which is commonly used for sequential data like time series data. Therefore, it could be possible that the data format used in this deep learning pipeline is either spatial data or time series data. But without more explicit information about the data format, I cannot definitively state what data format is being used.
