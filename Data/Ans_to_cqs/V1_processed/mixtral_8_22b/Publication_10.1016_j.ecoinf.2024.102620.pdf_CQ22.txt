The validation metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this context are the Pearson correlation coefficient (R), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). These metrics help assess the credibility of the predicted values.

The Pearson correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of association between the predicted and actual values. Its value ranges from 0 to 1, with a higher value indicating a stronger correlation.

RMSE is used to quantify the difference between the predicted and actual values. Lower RMSE values indicate better model performance. Specifically, an RMSE of less than 0.1 indicates high accuracy, while values between 0.1 and 0.2, between 0.2 and 0.3, and greater than 0.3 indicate good, acceptable, and low accuracy, respectively.

MAPE is another metric used to evaluate the accuracy of predictions by comparing predicted and actual values. It expresses the accuracy as a percentage. MAPE values below 0.1 indicate excellent prediction accuracy, values between 0.1 and 0.2 indicate good accuracy, and values between 0.2 and 0.5 indicate acceptable accuracy. Values above 0.5 indicate incorrect predictions.
