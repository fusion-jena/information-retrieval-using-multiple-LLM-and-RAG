The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is not explicitly stated but can be inferred from the context. The study aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of cetacean vocalization detection using deep learning models. This suggests that the primary goal of the deep learning model is to detect or identify cetacean vocalizations within audio recordings. Additionally, the study mentions leveraging multi-annotation campaigns involving both expert and novice annotators to address the challenges associated with the scarcity of ground truth data in underwater Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) studies. This implies that the deep learning model may also classify or categorize these detected vocalizations based on their characteristics or features. However, without explicit confirmation, it should be noted that the main objective of the deep learning model appears to be focused on improving cetacean vocalization detection rather than other tasks such as segmentation or generation.
