Unfortunately, based on the provided context, there isn't any explicit mention or discussion about specific evaluation metrics for assessing the performance of the deep learning models such as accuracy, precision, recall, etc. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding what metrics are being used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, typically, depending upon the problem statement and requirements, different evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves, confusion matrix, etc., could be employed to measure the effectiveness of a deep learning model.
