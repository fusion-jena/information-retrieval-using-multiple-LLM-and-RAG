The text does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model. However, it does mention some architectural parameters of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):

- Number of filters per convolution layer: 32 for the first layer, 64 for the second layer, and 128 for the third/final layer.
- Kernel size (height and width of the convolution window): 3x3 for all convolution layers.
- Fully Connected Layer (FC): Consists of 512 neurons.
- Softmax layer: Has the number of units equal to the types of sounds being classified.

These details describe the architecture of the CNN but do not include any information regarding the optimization algorithm, learning rate, batch size, epochs, or other hyperparameters typically associated with training a deep learning model.
