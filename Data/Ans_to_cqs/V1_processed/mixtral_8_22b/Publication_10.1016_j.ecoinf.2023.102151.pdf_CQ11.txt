Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the utilization of existing remote sensing data and web-based APIs, including resources like Crop-CASMA for US soil moisture data. However, it does not provide any direct links to repositories containing deep learning pipelines. Therefore, without additional context or information, it is impossible to determine the exact data repository link for the mentioned deep learning pipeline.
