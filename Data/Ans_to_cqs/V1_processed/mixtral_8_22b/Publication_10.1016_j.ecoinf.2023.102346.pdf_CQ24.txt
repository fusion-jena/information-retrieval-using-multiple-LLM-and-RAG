The provided context does not directly address the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to use techniques like setting fixed seeds or using deterministic algorithms to manage randomness and improve reproducibility. In some cases, researchers may also employ methods like cross-validation or bootstrapping to account for variability due to random initialization or data sampling. Unfortunately, without more information on the specific deep learning pipeline being discussed, it is difficult to provide a detailed response regarding the strategies used to handle randomness.
