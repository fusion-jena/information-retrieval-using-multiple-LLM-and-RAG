Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide a detailed response about the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, based on common practices, some general steps could have been taken. These might include model serialization, where the trained model is saved into a file or database for later use. Another step could involve platform selection, choosing a suitable environment such as cloud services or local servers to host the deployed model. Other considerations may also apply depending on the specific requirements of the project.
