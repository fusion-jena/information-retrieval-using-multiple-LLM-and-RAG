After a model has been trained, it needs to be validated and tested to confirm that it has achieved the desired performance. The performance might be measured using different metrics, such as classification accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc. These metrics help evaluate how well the model performs on unseen data. A confusion matrix can also be generated to visualize the performance of the model. It provides information about actual and predicted classifications done by a classification system. Additionally, saliency maps can be used to understand what parts of the input data were most important for the model's predictions. This can provide insights into the decision-making process of the model.
