The authors used diverse datasets to train their deep learning model, including wildfires from different regions and with varying sizes. They also validated their model using independent wildfires, which helped ensure its generalizability. Additionally, they employed recursive validation of the burned area classification algorithm to determine the optimal number of trees in the random forest hyperparameter setting, further improving the model's performance and applicability across various scenarios. However, it appears that the study did not explicitly mention the use of techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting for model evaluation.
