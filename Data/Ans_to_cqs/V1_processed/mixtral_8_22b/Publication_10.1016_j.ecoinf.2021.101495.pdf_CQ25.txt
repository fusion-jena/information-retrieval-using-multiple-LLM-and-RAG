The purpose of the deep learning model is twofold: segmentation and classification. For segmentation, the authors use a neural network trained using TensorFlow Object Detection API to separate individual fish from the background in images containing multiple fish. This process is demonstrated in Figure 3, which shows examples of individual fish after segmentation has been performed. For classification, another neural network is employed to identify the species of the fish. In this case, the authors chose a residual neural network (ResNet50V2), which allows the model to skip certain layers during processing. This model is implemented in TensorFlow and pre-trained with the ImageNet dataset. The goal of this classification model is to accurately determine the species of each fish present in the image data.
