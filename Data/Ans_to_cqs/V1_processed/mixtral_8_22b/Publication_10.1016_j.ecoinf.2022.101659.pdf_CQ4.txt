The given context does not provide information about any specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. Data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, scaling, etc., are commonly used in image processing tasks within deep learning pipelines to increase the amount of training data available and reduce overfitting. However, without further details or context regarding the use of deep learning methods, it cannot be determined if these techniques were employed in this case.
