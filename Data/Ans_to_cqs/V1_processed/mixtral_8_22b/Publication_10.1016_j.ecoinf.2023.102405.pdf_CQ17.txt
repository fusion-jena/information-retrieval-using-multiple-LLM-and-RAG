Regularization methods are techniques used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines by adding a penalty term to the loss function or modifying the network architecture. Two common regularization methods are dropout and L2 regularization. Dropout randomly sets a fraction of input units to 0 during training, effectively preventing complex co-adaptations on training data. This helps improve generalization performance on unseen data. On the other hand, L2 regularization adds a squared magnitude of weights as a penalty term to the loss function, discouraging large weights and promoting simpler models. Other regularization methods include early stopping, data augmentation, and batch normalization. Early stopping stops training when validation error starts increasing, while data augmentation generates additional training samples through transformations like rotation, zooming, etc. Batch normalization standardizes inputs within a layer, reducing internal covariance shift and improving convergence speed. These methods can be combined to achieve better results.

Based on the provided context, it appears that the paper does not explicitly mention any specific regularization method used in their proposed AODEGRU model. However, considering the prevalence of these techniques in deep learning research, it would be reasonable to assume that some form of regularization was employed to prevent overfitting. Without further information, one cannot definitively state which regularization methods were utilized in this particular case.
