The paper does not explicitly mention the use of standard datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it uses a custom dataset derived from satellite imagery. This dataset is created by performing semantic segmentation on the satellite images to extract four classes: urban, bare soil, vegetation, and road. Each image containing a specific class is then divided into non-overlapping blocks of 256 x 256 pixels and saved into separate folders named according to their respective classes.

The dataset is further divided into three sets: a training set consisting of 22,666 images, a validation set comprising 7,554 images, and a testing set also containing 7,554 images. However, the source of these satellite images is not mentioned in the provided context.
