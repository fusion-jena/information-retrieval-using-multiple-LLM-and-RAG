After training the deep learning models, specifically the YOLOv5 family models (i.e., YOLOv5n, YOLOv5s, YOLOv5m, YOLOv5l, and YOLOv5x), the best performing model was selected for deployment. To deploy this application to the web, a containerization system was utilized. Specifically, Docker, an open platform used for building, distributing, and running containerized applications, was employed to create the container. Once the container was built using Docker, it was then hosted with Google Cloud Run, another service used to build and deploy containerized applications. Therefore, the process involved selecting the best trained model, creating a container using Docker, and hosting the container with Google Cloud Run.
