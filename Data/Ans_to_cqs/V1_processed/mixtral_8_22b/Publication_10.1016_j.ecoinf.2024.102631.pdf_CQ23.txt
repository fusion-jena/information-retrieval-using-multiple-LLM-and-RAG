To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken during its development and evaluation process. Firstly, the model was tested on three diverse datasets - C-60, U45, and UCCS - each containing different types of underwater images captured under various conditions. This allowed the model to learn from a wide range of data, improving its ability to handle real-world scenarios. Secondly, the experiment settings ensured consistency and fairness in evaluating the model against state-of-the-art methods. All methods underwent identical testing and training processes throughout the experiments. Furthermore, the evaluation environment was standardized using an NVIDIA RTX 6000 48GB GPU and Intel Xeon(R) Gold 6230 CPU @ 2.10GHz Ã— 80. Lastly, the model was trained for 300 epochs using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate set to 0.0001, ensuring thorough optimization and convergence. These measures collectively contributed to the robustness and generalizability of the developed deep learning model.
