To deploy the trained deep learning model, a specific process was followed. This process consisted of three main phases: i) training the model with a large dataset, ii) validating the model to avoid overfitting, and iii) letting field experts evaluate the model with a completely new dataset independent from the first and second datasets. The model could only be deployed if it passed all three phases successfully. These phases were outlined in Figure 3 of the paper. However, the exact details of how the model was serialized or what platform was selected for deployment were not explicitly mentioned in the given references.
