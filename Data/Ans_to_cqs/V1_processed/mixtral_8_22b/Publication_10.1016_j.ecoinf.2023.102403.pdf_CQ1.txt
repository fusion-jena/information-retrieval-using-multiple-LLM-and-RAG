The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the study utilizes data from two major sources: Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS), which are both publicly available databases. These databases contain various types of biological data collected using diverse methods such as field observations, museum collections, citizen science projects, and scientific literature. The authors apply a series of filters to enhance the quality and reliability of the information obtained from these databases. They retain all taxonomic information down to the species level and remove records with missing values or duplicates based on identical latitude and longitude coordinates. Additionally, they analyze the potential effects of certain attributes like body size, habitat depth, and commercial use on the number of records in global databases. Therefore, while the exact methodology for initial data collection is not specified, this study primarily relies on existing data from reputable sources and employs rigorous filtering techniques to ensure high-quality input for their analyses.
