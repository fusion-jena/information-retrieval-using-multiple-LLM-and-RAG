Unfortunately, there isn't any information about specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline within the given context. However, generally speaking, some common data annotation techniques used in deep learning include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. These techniques involve labeling or marking objects within images or videos to provide ground truth data for training deep learning models.

Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest within an image or video frame. Semantic segmentation involves assigning each pixel in an image with a class label, while instance segmentation involves identifying individual instances of objects within an image. Other types of annotations may also be used depending on the specific application and requirements of the deep learning project.
