After the model training, several postprocessing steps can be taken depending on the specific application and goals of the analysis. Some common postprocessing steps include:

1. Model evaluation: This involves calculating various metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), bias, and correlation coefficient to evaluate the performance of the model. These metrics help assess how well the model predicts the target variable and identify any potential biases or errors in the predictions.
2. Visualization: Visualizing the output of the model can provide insights into the patterns and relationships learned by the model. For example, saliency maps can highlight the most important input features contributing to the predicted output. Similarly, confusion matrices can show the distribution of correct and incorrect classifications made by the model.
3. Hyperparameter optimization: Tuning the hyperparameters of the model can improve its performance further. Grid search or other optimization techniques can be employed to find the optimal set of hyperparameters.
4. Ensemble modeling: Combining multiple models can often lead to improved performance compared to individual models. Techniques such as bagging, boosting, or stacking can be applied to create ensembles of models.

In this study, the authors evaluated their deep learning model against a random forest regression model as a baseline. They calculated MAE, RMSE, bias, and correlation coefficients to compare the two models. Additionally, they optimized the hyperparameters of both models using grid search. However, no visualizations or ensemble modeling techniques were mentioned in the paper.
