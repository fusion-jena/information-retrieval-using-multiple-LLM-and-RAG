The text mentions several metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. One of them is the Mean Average Precision (mAP) metric, which is used to evaluate the PASCAL VOC challenge dataset. This metric calculates the mean over all considered species of their respective, species-specific average precision. The subscript 50 refers to the requirement that the area of the intersection of the ground truth bounding box and the predicted bounding box needs to be at least 50% of the area of the union of both for an otherwise true species identification to be considered correct.

Additionally, the text introduces another measure called Eα, which is described as the weighted harmonic mean between specificity and recall with α ∈ [0, 1] and S, R ∈ (0, 1]. Eα reduces to R for α = 0 and to S for α = 1 while E0.5 considers specificity and recall with equal weight. It is mentioned that this measure is new and representative of the ecology use cases in the application.

Furthermore, the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) is also discussed as a measure for classification. However, it is noted that although the informedness aspect captures some of the objectives, MCC is a single number that does not allow mediating between the two use cases.
