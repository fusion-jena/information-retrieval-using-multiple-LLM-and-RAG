The provided context does not contain information about the hyperparameters used in any deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer based solely on this context. However, common hyperparameters used in deep learning models include learning rate, optimizer, batch size, number of epochs, and regularization parameters like L1 and L2 penalties.
