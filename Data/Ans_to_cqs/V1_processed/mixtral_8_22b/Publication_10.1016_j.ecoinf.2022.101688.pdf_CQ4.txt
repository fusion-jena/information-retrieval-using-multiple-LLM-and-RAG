Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general practices in deep learning, some commonly used data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, zooming, shifting, shearing, and brightness adjustment. These techniques help improve the robustness and generalization ability of models by increasing the diversity of training data without collecting new samples. In the context of image classification tasks using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), such as those mentioned in the provided text, data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotation, and scaling are often employed to enhance the performance of the models.
