The text does not provide explicit information on the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions that the training set is used for fitting the models, and the validation set is used to estimate prediction error for model selection and hyperparameter tuning. These statements suggest that the training process might continue until the model achieves satisfactory performance on the validation set or reaches a predefined number of iterations. Commonly used criteria to determine when training is complete include reaching a minimum validation loss, achieving a stable validation accuracy, or observing no significant improvement in validation performance after several epochs.
