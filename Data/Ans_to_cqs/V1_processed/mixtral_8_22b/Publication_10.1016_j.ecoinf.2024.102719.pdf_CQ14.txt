The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) algorithm. This algorithm is specifically designed for efficient searching in high-dimensional spaces. It works by estimating the probability distribution of the hyperparameters using a probabilistic model. Then, it iteratively constructs a tree of Gaussian distributions to approximate the objective function. Based on this probabilistic model, new hyperparameters are selected for subsequent rounds of Machine Learning (ML) evaluation. In this study, the TPE algorithm was implemented in various packages such as CatBoost, LightGBM, XGBoost, and Hyperopt.
