The given context does not provide specific details about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, it mentions that the study uses machine learning models and discusses the importance of selecting appropriate training data subsets for improving predictive outputs. Based on this information, we can infer that the deployment process likely involves saving or serializing the trained model and then integrating it into a suitable platform for making predictions. This could involve using popular libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch for model serialization and platforms like Flask or Django for web application integration. Nevertheless, without explicit details regarding the deployment process, we cannot provide a definitive answer.
