The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it can be inferred that the authors likely followed common practices in machine learning and deep learning when splitting their dataset. Typically, the dataset is divided into three subsets: training set, validation set, and testing set. The training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set is employed during the training process to fine-tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Lastly, the testing set is utilized to evaluate the final performance of the trained model. Common ratios for dividing the dataset include 60-20-20%, 70-15-15%, or 80-10-10% for the training, validation, and testing sets, respectively. It should also be noted that the context mentions the use of machine learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks, suggesting that these methods could have been applied to create advanced classifiers for reducing sound misclassification.
