The given context does not provide information on specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) used within the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses various aspects of a deep learning process involving transformer models, attention mechanisms, and multivariate marine chemical data predictions.

Transformers use the self-attention mechanism, allowing them to weigh the importance of different parts of the input data differently. This mechanism is represented by Formula 5 in the context. Additionally, the text mentions using neural networks and extracting explicit formulas for calculating dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations.

While these details contribute to understanding the overall deep learning process, they do not directly address the optimization techniques employed during training. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, we cannot determine which optimization techniques like SGD or Adam are being utilized in the deep learning pipeline.
