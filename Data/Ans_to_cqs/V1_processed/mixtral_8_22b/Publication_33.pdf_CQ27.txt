The text does not provide explicit details regarding the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, based on common practices in machine learning projects, after completing the training and validation phases, the next step would typically involve saving or serializing the trained model into a format suitable for use in production environments. This could include formats such as ONNX, TensorFlow SavedModel, PyTorch TorchScript, or others depending on the chosen deep learning library. Once serialized, the model can be deployed onto various platforms like cloud services (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure), edge devices, mobile apps, etc., again depending on the project requirements. Unfortunately, without more specific information, I cannot provide a detailed description of the exact process followed in this particular case.
