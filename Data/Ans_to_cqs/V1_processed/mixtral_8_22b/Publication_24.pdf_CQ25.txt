The purpose of the deep learning model used in this study is for classification. Specifically, it is used to classify different classes in datasets without being specified a priori. The deep learning model employed here is Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), also known as Deep Learning. The parameters of the CNN are learned from training data, allowing it to automatically select features that best distinguish between different classes in the dataset. This approach takes advantage of large quantities of training data and improves classification performance.
