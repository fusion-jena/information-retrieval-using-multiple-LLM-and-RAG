The text does not provide explicit information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that large and diverse datasets from international organizations such as Copernicus, EMODnet, and UNEP were utilized. These datasets likely contain environmental data related to water temperature, salinity, nutrients, transparency, bathymetry, bottom substrate, and distances to cities, ports, and river outflows. The goal was to explore the nonlinear dynamics between environment, ecosystem, and human influence on seagrass presence and distribution in the Mediterranean Sea. Therefore, these datasets might include various types of geospatial and ecological data relevant to marine environments.
