The given context does not provide information about specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, or scaling used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions bootstrapping, a type of resampling technique where the training data is randomly sampled with replacement. This method helps improve model precision by reducing stochastic errors in estimation. Additionally, the text emphasizes the importance of considering both the algorithm and the structure of the training data when building accurate Species Distribution Models (SDMs), noting that the environmental manifold's spatial pattern and shape affect the performance of Generalized Linear Model (GLM) and Random Forest (RF) models.
