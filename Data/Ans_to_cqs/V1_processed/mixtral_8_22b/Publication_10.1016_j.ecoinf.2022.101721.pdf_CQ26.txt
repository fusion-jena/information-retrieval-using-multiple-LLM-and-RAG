The text does not provide explicit information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions using published means of fmaxe to determine the species most likely to have produced echolocation calls. This suggests that researchers use statistical methods to analyze and interpret the observed data. Additionally, the R-code mentioned in the text allows users to adopt different means and standard deviations (SDs) depending on local features of the study area. This could potentially help reduce data bias by taking into account variations in the environment and behavior of the studied organisms. While the text does not explicitly mention stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, these techniques can still be applied to address data bias in the preprocessing stage of the deep learning pipeline. For instance, stratified splitting ensures that each class has equal representation in both training and testing datasets. Oversampling increases the number of instances in minority classes, while undersampling reduces the number of instances in majority classes. Lastly, collecting diverse data helps ensure that the model generalizes well across various scenarios.
