The text does not provide any explicit information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It only mentions that an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 GPU was used for training the model. However, it doesn't specify whether this GPU was part of a cloud service like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform, or if it was a local machine setup. Therefore, without additional context, we cannot determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
