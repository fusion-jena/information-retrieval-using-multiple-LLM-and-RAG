The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the information given about the use of Poisson distribution and the prediction of counts of species, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is likely being used for regression or density estimation tasks related to species distribution modelling. Specifically, the goal appears to be to estimate the expected count of a specific species given some input features using a neural network architecture.
