The text does not explicitly state which specific type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline. However, it mentions that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used to learn flexible deep features. Therefore, it can be inferred that a form of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is employed in their methodology.
