From the given context, it appears that there isn't explicit information about the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, based on common practices in machine learning, several strategies could have been employed. These might include tracking metrics such as loss or accuracy over each epoch, visualizing the learning curves, or evaluating the model on validation sets periodically throughout the training process. In this case, the model was trained for 100 epochs with a batch size of 32 and an input image dimension of 640 x 640. Default data augmentation techniques like scaling, color space adjustments, and Mosaic augmentation were also applied during the training process. It would be reasonable to assume that some form of monitoring was conducted to ensure optimal performance and prevent issues like underfitting or overfitting. Nevertheless, without more detailed information, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the exact strategy used to monitor the model performance during training.
