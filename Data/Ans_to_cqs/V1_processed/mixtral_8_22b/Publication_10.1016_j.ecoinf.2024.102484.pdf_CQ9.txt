The given context does not provide information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that the amount of data publicly provided by the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD) was small and suggests using data from the Basic Soil Property Dataset of High-resolution China Soil Information Grids along with HWSD to improve temporal and spatial accuracy in future research on soil degradation. However, there is no mention of any specific data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based on the given context.
