Three evaluation metrics are used to assess the performance of the deep learning models: Mean Loss, Test Loss, and Test RMSE. These metrics are calculated for each species and for two subsets of sites - a train set and a test set. The train set is used for fitting all models while the test set is used to test the models' generalization capabilities. The average values of these metrics over the 50 species are considered. Additionally, another metric called Test A10%DQ is mentioned, although not explicitly defined within the given context.
