The purpose of the deep learning model used in this study is for plant classification. The authors chose to use the ResNet50 model, which consists of a stack of similar (residual) blocks, each block being a stack of convolutional layers. The innovation of this architecture is that the output of a block is also connected with its own input through an identity mapping path, which helps to improve the gradient backward flow in the network and allows for the training of much deeper networks. The goal of this model is to accurately classify plants based on their visual features, as determined by the ImageNet dataset.
