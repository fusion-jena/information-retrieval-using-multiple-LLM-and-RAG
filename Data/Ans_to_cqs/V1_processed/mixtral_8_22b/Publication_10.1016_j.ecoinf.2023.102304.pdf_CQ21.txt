The given context does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, based on general machine learning practices, some common postprocessing steps include calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., creating confusion matrices to visualize the performance of the classifier, generating saliency maps or heatmaps to understand which parts of the input data were most important for the model's predictions, and performing cross-validation to ensure the robustness of the model. Please note that these are general steps and may vary depending on the specific requirements and nature of the problem being solved.
