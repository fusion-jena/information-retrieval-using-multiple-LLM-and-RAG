The hyperparameters of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model are optimized using a combination of grid search and cross-validation techniques. Specifically, the regularization parameter 'C' and the kernel type (which is linear in this case) are calibrated through this approach. This method aims to strike a balance between model complexity and its ability to generalize well. Furthermore, when dealing with non-linear SVM models, the kernel coefficient 'gamma' also undergoes optimization via grid search to ensure the model fits the data distribution appropriately.
