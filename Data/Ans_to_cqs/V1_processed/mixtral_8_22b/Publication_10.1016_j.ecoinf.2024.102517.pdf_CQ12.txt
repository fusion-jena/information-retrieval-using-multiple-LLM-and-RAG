The paper uses a deep learning model based on TensorFlow and CUDA for the task of reducing noise in bird sounds. Although the specific architecture of the model is not explicitly mentioned, it is referred to as a 'bird sound noise reduction network based on deep feature loss.' Given this information, it cannot be definitively stated which type of deep learning model is being used (i.e., CNN, RNN, or Transformer). However, considering that the authors mention using a GPU for training and referencing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in their abbreviation list, it could be inferred that they are employing some form of a CNN-based architecture for their deep learning model.
