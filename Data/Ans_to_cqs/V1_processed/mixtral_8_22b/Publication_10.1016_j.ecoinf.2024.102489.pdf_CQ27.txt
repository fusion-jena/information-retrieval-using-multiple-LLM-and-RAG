The given context does not provide information on the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. The text discusses issues related to the use of Random Forest (RF) models for predicting low-value Leaf Area Index (LAI), the impact of training sample quality on prediction results, and the application of deep neural networks for improving parameter predictions. However, it does not mention any specifics about the deployment of a trained deep learning model, including processes like model serialization or platform selection.
