The text does not provide explicit information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, considering common practices in scientific research, it would be reasonable to expect that the authors have made their data publicly accessible through one of the mentioned platforms or another relevant platform like GitHub. To find out exactly where the data are stored, I recommend checking the original publication or contacting the corresponding author directly.
