Unfortunately, based on the given information, it is not possible to determine how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. There is no mention of any specific optimization techniques such as grid search or random search being used for tuning the hyperparameters of the MaxEnt model. Therefore, without additional context or information, it cannot be determined how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized.
