The deep learning model, referred to as the SSA-TPRF model, was deployed on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The GEE is a nonprofit cloud-computing platform designed specifically for geospatial analysis. It provides extensive Earth observation data, various classification algorithms, and robust cloud-computing capabilities, making it an ideal choice for processing remote sensing data. In this case, the GEE platform was utilized for tasks like LULC mapping, wetland mapping, crop mapping, grassland mapping, forest monitoring, and aboveground biomass estimation.
