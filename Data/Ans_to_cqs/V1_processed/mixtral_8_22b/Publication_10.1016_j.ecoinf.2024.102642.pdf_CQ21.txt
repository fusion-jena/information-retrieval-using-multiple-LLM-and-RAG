After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the project. In the given context, two main postprocessing steps are mentioned: calculating evaluation metrics and visualizing saliency maps.

Evaluation metrics are crucial for assessing the performance of the trained models. In this study, Area Under Curve (AUC) and Mean Average Precision (mAP) are used as evaluation metrics. These metrics provide insights into how well the models perform in detecting and classifying audio events within underwater acoustic recordings. To calculate these metrics, the predicted outputs of the models are compared against the pseudo ground truth annotations provided by both experts and novices. This allows for a quantitative assessment of the models' performance.

Additionally, saliency maps can be generated to gain further insight into the models' predictions. Saliency maps highlight the regions of input data that contribute most significantly to the output prediction. By visualizing these maps, researchers can better understand which features of the input data are being utilized by the models during classification tasks. This information can then be used to improve the models' performance or develop new models with enhanced feature extraction capabilities.

Overall, postprocessing steps like evaluating metrics and generating saliency maps play a critical role in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of trained models. They enable researchers to optimize their models and ultimately improve the accuracy of audio event detection and classification in underwater environments.
