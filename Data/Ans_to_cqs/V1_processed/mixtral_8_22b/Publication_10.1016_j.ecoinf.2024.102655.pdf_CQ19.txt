The given context does not explicitly mention which specific frameworks were used to build the deep learning models. However, it mentions three types of machine learning models used in this study: Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). These models can be implemented using various deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, etc. But without further information, we cannot determine which exact framework was utilized in building these models.
