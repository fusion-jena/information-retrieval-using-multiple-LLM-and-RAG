The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, based on the available information, we can infer that the model is likely used for classification purposes. Specifically, it classifies fishing activity cells into different categories such as stocks or non-stocks. This classification is performed using a machine learning model applied to vessel data aggregated at 0.01 resolutions. Additionally, the model seems to be integrated into a larger workflow that aims to estimate fishing pressure on various marine species and their habitats.
