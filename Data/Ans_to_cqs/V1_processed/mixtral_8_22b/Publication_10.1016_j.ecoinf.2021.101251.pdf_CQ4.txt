I apologize, but based on the given context, there isn't any information about data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. Data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, scaling, etc., are commonly used in computer vision tasks to increase the size of training sets by creating modified versions of images in the dataset. However, without more context related to deep learning pipelines, I cannot provide a helpful response regarding the specific data augmentation techniques applied.
