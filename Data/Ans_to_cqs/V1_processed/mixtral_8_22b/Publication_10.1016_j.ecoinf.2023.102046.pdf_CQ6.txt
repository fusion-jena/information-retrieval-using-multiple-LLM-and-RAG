Before training a deep learning model such as ResNet-50 or Inception-V3, several preprocessing steps may be required depending on the specific dataset and task. These steps can include data cleaning, where any irrelevant or incorrect data points are removed or corrected. Normalization and scaling are common techniques used to ensure that input features have similar scales, preventing certain features from dominating others during training. This can involve standardizing inputs to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, or scaling them between a fixed range like [0, 1] or [-1, 1]. Data augmentation is another important technique used to increase the diversity of the training data and improve generalization. This can involve applying random transformations to the input images, such as rotations, translations, flips, or color changes. Additionally, dealing with dataset imbalances might require assigning class weights to the cross-entropy loss function, ensuring that minority classes receive more attention during training.
