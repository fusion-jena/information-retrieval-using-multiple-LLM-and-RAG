The given context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of high spatial resolution satellite image data, which suggests that the data format used might be related to imagery or remote sensing data. In particular, the study uses MODIS products and Landsat data, both of which provide satellite imagery data. Additionally, the study discusses using machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Random Forest (RF) models, which typically work with structured data formats like CSV files containing numerical features. Nevertheless, without explicit information about the exact data format used in the deep learning pipeline, we cannot definitively state whether the input data consists solely of image data or if other formats like CSV files are also utilized.
