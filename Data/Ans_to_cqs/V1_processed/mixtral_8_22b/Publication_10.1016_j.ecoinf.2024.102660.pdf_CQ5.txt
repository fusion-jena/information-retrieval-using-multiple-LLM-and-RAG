The paper does not explicitly mention any well-known datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it mentions the use of a custom dataset called the Water Sun Glint Detection (WSGD) dataset. This dataset consists of 1764 image pairs, which have been preprocessed and divided into three subsets: one for training, another for validation, and the last for testing the model after training. Specifically, there are 1232 image pairs for training, 176 image pairs for validation, and 356 image pairs for testing. The dataset has been created specifically for detecting water sun glint in UAV water images.
