The text does not provide explicit information regarding the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the context that the authors use satellite imagery for their research. Therefore, the most likely data format used in this case is image data. Specifically, they mention using Google Earth Engine (GEE), a cloud processing platform with a vast collection of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets. Furthermore, they discuss classifying these images using an unsupervised clustering algorithm (ee.Clusterer.wekaKMeans) and segmenting them into different classes based on various bands such as RGB, near infrared, and shortwave infrared. All these details suggest that the researchers primarily work with image data in their deep learning pipeline.
