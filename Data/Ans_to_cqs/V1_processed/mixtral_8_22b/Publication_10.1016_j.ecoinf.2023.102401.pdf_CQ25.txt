The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, based on the available information, it can be inferred that the model is designed for object detection tasks, specifically for detecting underwater targets or organisms. This is evident from the use of the YWnet network, which is likely a customized version of a popular neural network architecture tailored for underwater image analysis. Additionally, the inclusion of the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) further supports this assumption, as it enhances the feature extraction capabilities of the model, making it more suitable for object detection tasks.
