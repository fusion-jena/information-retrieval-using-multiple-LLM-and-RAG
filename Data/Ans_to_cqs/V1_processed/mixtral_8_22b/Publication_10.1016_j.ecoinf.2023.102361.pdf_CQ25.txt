The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the given context is for image classification. This is evident from the statement in section 2.3 where it mentions that the models were selected based on their suitability for image classification tasks. Additionally, in section 2.7, it states that the models were initialized with pre-trained weights trained on the ImageNet dataset, which is a popular benchmark for image classification tasks. Furthermore, the statement about replacing the classification layer of the models for fine-tuning them on the crop-weed dataset also indicates that the models are being used for image classification purposes. Therefore, the purpose of the deep learning models in this study is to perform image classification tasks.
