The paper compares the performance of various feature representations using several evaluation metrics. These include bcubed precision, bcubed recall, bcubed Fscore, and purity. Bcubed precision measures how many events within each cluster belong to the same class, while bcubed recall calculates the proportion of correctly classified events per class. The bcubed Fscore combines both precision and recall into one metric. Purity evaluates the homogeneity of each cluster, measuring the percentage of elements belonging to the most common class in the cluster.
