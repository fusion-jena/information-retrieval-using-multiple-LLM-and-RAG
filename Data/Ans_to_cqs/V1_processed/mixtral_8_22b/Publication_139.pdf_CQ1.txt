The text does not provide explicit details regarding the method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the given context, we can infer that the authors might have used some sort of recording devices such as microphones or audio recorders to collect the audio data. This is evident from the fact that the authors mention working with audio data and converting them into spectrograms for further processing. Additionally, the authors also discuss selecting specific days for annotation, indicating that they had access to a large pool of recorded audio data. Therefore, although the exact method of data collection is not mentioned, it can be assumed that the authors used recording devices to gather the necessary audio data for their study.
