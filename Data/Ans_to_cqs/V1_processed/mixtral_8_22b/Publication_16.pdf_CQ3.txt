The text does not explicitly mention any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does state that CNN approaches require a large corpus of high-quality annotated data. This suggests that some form of annotation was applied to the data used in the study. Without further information, it cannot be determined whether techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation were employed.
