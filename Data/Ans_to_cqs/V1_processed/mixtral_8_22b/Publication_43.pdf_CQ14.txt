According to the given context, it appears that the optimization of the hyperparameters of the model is done manually by the user. Specifically, the user needs to manually optimize and initialize a set of non-dimensional parameters, including the scale parameter, the shape versus color parameter, and the compactness versus smoothness parameter. However, there is no mention of specific methods used for this optimization process, such as grid search or random search. Therefore, based solely on the information provided, it cannot be determined how exactly the hyperparameters of the model are optimized beyond manual adjustments made by the user.
