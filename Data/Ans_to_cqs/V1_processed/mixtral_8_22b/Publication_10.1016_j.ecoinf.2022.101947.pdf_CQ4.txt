The given context does not provide information about the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, translation, and color space transformations. These techniques help increase the size and diversity of training datasets, which can improve model performance and generalization. Without more specific details from the context, it is impossible to determine exactly which techniques were employed in this case.
