The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that supervised-based methods rely on data augmentation to create image pairs for building training tasks. Data augmentation techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, and color space transformations. These techniques help increase the size and diversity of the training set, improving the model's ability to generalize and reducing overfitting. In the absence of explicit details regarding the employed data augmentation techniques, one could infer that standard techniques such as those mentioned above may have been utilized.
