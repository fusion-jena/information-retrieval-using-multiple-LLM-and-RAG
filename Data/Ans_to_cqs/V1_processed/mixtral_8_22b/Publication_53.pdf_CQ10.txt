The text does not provide a direct link to the code repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. However, it mentions that the Python-based open-source library "fastai" version 1 was used for training the deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN). Therefore, it can be assumed that the code repository might be related to or based on the FastAI library. Unfortunately, without further information, I cannot provide a specific link to the exact code repository used in this research.
