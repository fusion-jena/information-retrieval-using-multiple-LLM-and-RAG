Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. However, based on common practices in developing deep learning models, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), popular frameworks like TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch might have been employed. These frameworks provide essential tools and functionalities required to design, train, and test complex neural network architectures efficiently. Nonetheless, without explicit information regarding the frameworks used in this particular case, we cannot definitively state which ones were implemented.
