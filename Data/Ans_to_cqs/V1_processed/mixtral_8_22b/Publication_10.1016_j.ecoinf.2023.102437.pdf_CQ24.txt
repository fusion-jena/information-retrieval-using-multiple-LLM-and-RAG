In the field of deep learning, including machine learning applications in environmental science, managing randomness is crucial for ensuring reproducibility and reliability of results. Randomness can arise from various sources within the deep learning pipeline, such as weight initialization, batch selection, dropout regularization, and shuffling of training examples. One common strategy to manage randomness is setting a fixed random seed value, which ensures consistent results across different runs of the same experiment. This approach is widely adopted due to its simplicity and effectiveness. Another strategy involves using deterministic algorithms instead of stochastic ones wherever possible. For instance, choosing a specific method for weight initialization, like Xavier or He initialization, can help reduce variability caused by random weight assignments. Additionally, employing techniques like cyclic learning rates or warm restarts can also mitigate the impact of randomness on model convergence and generalization. Lastly, conducting multiple runs with different seeds and averaging the results can provide a more robust estimate of model performance, accounting for the inherent uncertainty introduced by random processes in the deep learning pipeline.
