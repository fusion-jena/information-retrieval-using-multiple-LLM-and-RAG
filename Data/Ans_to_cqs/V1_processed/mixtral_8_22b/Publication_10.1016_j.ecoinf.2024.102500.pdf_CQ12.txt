The text does not provide information about the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It only mentions that XGB, RF, and ET were chosen to build a stacking-based ANN meta ML model. However, these are not types of deep learning models but rather ensemble methods (XGB - eXtreme Gradient Boosting, RF - Random Forest, ET - Extra Trees). Therefore, it cannot be determined from the provided context what type of deep learning model was used in the pipeline.
