After training the deep learning model using the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer with a momentum value of Î¼ = 0.9, the authors tested the model performance on the test set. They conducted their computations on a Dell PowerEdge C4130 rack server equipped with two Tesla K80 GPUs and 256 GB of memory. Their deep learning environment was based on the PyTorch 1.7.1 platform. However, the paper does not explicitly mention the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, further information would be required to provide a more detailed response regarding the deployment process.
