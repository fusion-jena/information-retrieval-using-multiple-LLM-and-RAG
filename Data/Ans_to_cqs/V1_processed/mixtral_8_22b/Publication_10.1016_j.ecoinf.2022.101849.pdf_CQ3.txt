The given context does not provide information about specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it discusses various forms of weakly supervised learning tasks, which can involve different types of labeling processes and data sources. These tasks might use some form of data annotation, although the exact methods are not mentioned. For instance, weak labels or partial labels are considered in the context of binary labels, while distribution learning involves outputs that must sum to unity. Additionally, the text mentions that labels are often scarce and/or noisy in real-world predictive tasks, indicating that data annotation could play a role in addressing these challenges. Nonetheless, without further details regarding the specific deep learning pipeline discussed in the context, it is impossible to determine the precise data annotation techniques employed.
