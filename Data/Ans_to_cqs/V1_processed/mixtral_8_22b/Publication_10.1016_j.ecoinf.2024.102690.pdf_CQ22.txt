Based on the given information, there is no direct mention of any specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model such as accuracy, precision, or recall. However, it does mention that the ideal number of bundles was established by calculating the Davis-Boldin Index (DBI). Additionally, hotspot analysis (Getis-Ord G*) was used to analyze the spatial clustering of ESV and consider hotspot areas with a significance level of 90% or more as optional ecological sources. Therefore, these indices could be considered as evaluation metrics for the deep learning model used in this study.
