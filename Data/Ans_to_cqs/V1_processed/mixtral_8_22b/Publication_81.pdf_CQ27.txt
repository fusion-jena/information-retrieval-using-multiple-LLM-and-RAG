The text does not provide specific details about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, common practices for deploying such models include model serialization, platform selection, and integration into existing systems or applications. Model serialization involves saving the trained model parameters and architecture in a file format that can be loaded later for use. Platform selection refers to choosing a suitable environment for running the deployed model, such as cloud services, edge devices, or local servers. Integrating the model into existing systems may involve creating APIs or wrappers around the model to facilitate communication between the model and other components of the system.
