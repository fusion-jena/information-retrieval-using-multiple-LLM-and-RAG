The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, based on the information available, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is likely being used for either image classification or semantic segmentation. This is because the text mentions the use of Random Forest classifiers and GLCM texture metrics for labeling segmented objects as 'woody' or 'non-woody'. Additionally, the context discusses the creation of training and validation points from sampling plots within different vegetation types, suggesting that the goal is to classify or segment these areas based on their land cover characteristics. Without more specific details, it cannot be definitively determined whether the deep learning model is intended for classification or segmentation tasks.
