In the given context, the method utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is a mobile application designed for post-dive interviews. The app focuses on gathering information about the frequency and abundance of specific marine taxa, which were preselected by local experts based on various factors such as conservation status, commercial interest, ecological function, and non-indigenous origins. The app collects metadata including location, number of dives, and number of divers, enabling normalization based on sampling effort. However, it should be noted that the app does not require submission of photographic evidence, which could potentially impact data accuracy due to misidentification of species. To mitigate this issue, the app relies on experienced dive guides to validate the species sightings during the post-dive interviews.
