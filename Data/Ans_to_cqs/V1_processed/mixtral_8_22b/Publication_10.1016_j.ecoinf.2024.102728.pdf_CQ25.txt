The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific purpose or type of deep learning model used in the research. However, based on the references cited, it can be inferred that the study involves some form of image processing using deep learning techniques. For instance, Mohedano et al. (2017) discuss object retrieval with deep convolutional neural networks, while Petrovska et al. (2020) focus on deep learning for feature extraction in remote sensing, specifically for aerial scene classification. Therefore, without further details, we cannot definitively state whether the deep learning model was designed for classification, segmentation, detection, or another task.
