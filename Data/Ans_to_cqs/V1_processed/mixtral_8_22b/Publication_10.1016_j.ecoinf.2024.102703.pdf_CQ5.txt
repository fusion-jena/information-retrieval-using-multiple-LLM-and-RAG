In this case, the dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that the dataset consists of water samples with features such as aCDOM(254), Fn(355), pH, water temperature, NH4-N, NO3-N, TN, TP, Chl-a, DOC, and TSI. These features are used to build a three-layer backpropagation artificial neural network using MATLAB R2014b. The aim is to predict the TSI based on the other features. A total of 64 water samples were used for model calibration, while the remaining samples were used for validation. The performance of the model was evaluated using metrics such as the coefficient of determination (R2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) between the measured and predicted TSI. Therefore, although the name of the dataset is not specified, we can infer that it is a custom dataset consisting of water sample measurements.
