In the given context, the deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly mentioned. However, there are clues that suggest the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Specifically, the text mentions the use of the deeplabv3+resnet269 model, where 'deeplabv3' refers to DeepLabv3, a semantic segmentation algorithm developed by Google, and'resnet269' refers to a 269-layer Residual Network (ResNet), both of which are types of CNN architectures. Therefore, it can be inferred that the pipeline primarily utilizes CNNs.
