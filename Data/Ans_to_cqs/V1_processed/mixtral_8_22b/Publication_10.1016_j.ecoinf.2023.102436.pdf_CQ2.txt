Based on the given context, it appears that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images. Specifically, the research papers mentioned use landscape photographs and convolutional neural networks for automatic recognition of woody regrowth vegetation in repeat landscape photographs. However, there is no explicit mention of other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV files being used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, we can only infer that images are the main data format used in this particular case.
