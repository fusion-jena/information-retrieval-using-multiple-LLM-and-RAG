Based on the given context, it can be inferred that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images. This is evident from several mentions of using images throughout the process, such as resizing and normalizing them for input into various CNN architectures like VGG16, ResNet50, ResNet101, Inception-v3, DenseNet201, and EfficientNetB0. Additionally, the context discusses applications of deep learning in processing online digital images for ecological purposes, such as recognizing plant diseases, classifying land cover, and detecting animals in camera traps. However, there is no explicit mention of any other data formats being utilized in this specific deep learning pipeline.
