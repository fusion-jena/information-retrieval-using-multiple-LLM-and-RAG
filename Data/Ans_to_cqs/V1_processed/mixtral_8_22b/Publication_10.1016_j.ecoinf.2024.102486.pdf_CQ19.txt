The text mentions several tools and libraries used for building deep learning models, including the Deep Learning Toolbox by MathWorks, cuDNN, and Darknet. However, it does not explicitly mention TensorFlow or PyTorch. It is important to note that these tools may serve different purposes within the context of deep learning development. For example, cuDNN is a library developed by NVIDIA for optimizing neural network computations, while Darknet is an open-source neural network framework written in C and CUDA. To determine whether TensorFlow or PyTorch were used specifically, more context would be needed.
