Based on the given context, it appears that the study does not use a deep learning model but rather employs traditional machine learning models. Specifically, the study utilizes an artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF) algorithms for modeling complex phenomena and nonlinear regression.

Artificial neural networks (ANNs) consist of three different layers: input, hidden, and output. They use calibration parameters like learning rate and weight to improve results. However, they do not fall under the category of deep learning models, as they typically have fewer layers compared to deep learning architectures like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), or transformers.

Random forests (RFs) are another popular machine learning technique used in this study. RFs are ensemble learning methods that combine multiple decision trees to produce more accurate predictions. Unlike ANNs, RFs do not involve any form of gradient descent optimization or backpropagation, making them fundamentally different from deep learning models.

Therefore, based on the provided context, no specific type of deep learning model, such as CNN, RNN, or transformer, is mentioned or utilized in the pipeline. Instead, traditional machine learning techniques like ANNs and RFs are employed for modeling purposes.
