Unfortunately, there is no information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model in the provided context. The context only includes data related to marine fish species and their attributes, such as body size, habitat depth, and cultural value, along with some calculations regarding species richness index (SRI) for different regions. There is no mention of any machine learning or deep learning models being used, let alone the specific hyperparameters employed in those models. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to your query based on the available information.
