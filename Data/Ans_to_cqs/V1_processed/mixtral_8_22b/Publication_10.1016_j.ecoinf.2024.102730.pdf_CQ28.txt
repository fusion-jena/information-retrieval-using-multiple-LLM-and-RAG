After reviewing the given sources, there isn't any information regarding which specific cloud platform or deployment environment was used for the deep learning models mentioned in these papers. The articles focus on various aspects such as monitoring vegetation dynamics, identifying plant species, analyzing Antarctic ecosystems, and understanding convolutional networks but do not provide details about the platforms used for deploying their respective deep learning models. Therefore, based on the available information, we cannot determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning models.
