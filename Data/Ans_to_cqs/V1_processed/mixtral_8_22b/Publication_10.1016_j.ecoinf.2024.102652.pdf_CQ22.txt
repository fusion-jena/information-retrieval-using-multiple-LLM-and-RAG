According to the given context, the performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using two main metrics: Pixel Accuracy (ACC) and Point of Intersection (POI). These evaluation metrics are mentioned in section 2.4 titled "Evaluation Metrics". However, it should be noted that the context does not provide specific details about how these metrics are calculated or what they represent.

Pixel Accuracy (ACC) could refer to a common metric used in image segmentation tasks where the number of correctly classified pixels is divided by the total number of pixels. This gives an overall measure of the model's ability to accurately classify individual pixels.

Point of Intersection (POI) might refer to a metric used in binary classification problems, which is also known as the Threshold or Operating Point. It represents the value at which the False Positive Rate (FPR) equals the True Positive Rate (TPR). In other words, POI can help determine the optimal threshold for converting probabilities into class labels while balancing sensitivity and specificity.

It is important to note that the context does not explicitly mention any other commonly used evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score. Therefore, based solely on the provided information, we can only conclude that the deep learning model's performance is evaluated using Pixel Accuracy (ACC) and Point of Intersection (POI).
