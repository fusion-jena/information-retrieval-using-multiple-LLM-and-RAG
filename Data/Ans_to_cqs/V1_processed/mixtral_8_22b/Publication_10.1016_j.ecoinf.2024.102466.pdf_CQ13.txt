The article does not provide specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning models, such as learning rates or optimizers. It focuses primarily on comparing the mean average precision (mAP) scores of various models like Cascade RCNN, FCOS, Sparse CNN, Faster RCNN, ATSS, and RepPoint when applied to bird recognition tasks using camera traps. The study reveals that Cascade RCNN performed best among them, reaching peak performance at around 10 epochs, while some models like ATSS and RepPoint required longer training schedules. However, details regarding the exact hyperparameter settings employed during the training process remain undisclosed within the available context.
