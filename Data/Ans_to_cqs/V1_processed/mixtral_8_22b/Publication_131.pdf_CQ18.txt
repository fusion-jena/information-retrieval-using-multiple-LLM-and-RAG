The text does not provide explicit information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, we can infer some details regarding the training process. The training was conducted using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), with different numbers of epochs for each network - three epochs for the first network and six epochs for the second network. Both networks had a batch size of 32. The initial learning rate was set to 0.001, and the 'adam' optimizer was utilized. These settings suggest that the model performance might have been monitored through metrics such as loss and accuracy, which are typically evaluated after each epoch during the training process. Additionally, early stopping could be employed to prevent overfitting by monitoring the validation loss and stopping the training when the performance stops improving. Nevertheless, without specific information about the monitoring strategy, these assumptions remain speculative.
