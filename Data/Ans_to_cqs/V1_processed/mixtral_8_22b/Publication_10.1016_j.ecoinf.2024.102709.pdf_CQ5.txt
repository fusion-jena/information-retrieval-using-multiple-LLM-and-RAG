Two datasets were used in the deep learning pipeline. The first dataset is the authors' own data, referred to as 'our data', which consists of clusters of extracted numbers. This dataset was used to train Models 4, 5, and 6. The second dataset is the modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset of handwritten digits. This dataset was used to train Models 1, 2, and 3. The MNIST dataset was also altered in size and placement to resemble the authors' own data.
