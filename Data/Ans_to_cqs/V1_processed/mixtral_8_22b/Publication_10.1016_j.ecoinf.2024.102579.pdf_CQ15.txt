The provided text does not contain any explicit mention of specific optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, there is a reference to optimizing estimators for reducing bias and root relative mean squared error (rRMSE) values while balancing the weights of sample trees with those of their neighbors. This suggests that some form of optimization technique may be employed in the process, but without further details, it cannot be confirmed if it involves traditional deep learning optimization methods like SGD or Adam.
