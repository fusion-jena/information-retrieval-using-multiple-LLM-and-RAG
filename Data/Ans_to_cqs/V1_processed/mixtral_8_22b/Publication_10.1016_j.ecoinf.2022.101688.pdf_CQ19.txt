The deep learning models in this case are built using TensorFlow 2. This is mentioned in the second paragraph where it states, "the CNNs were implemented in TensorFlow 2." TensorFlow is a popular open-source platform for machine learning and artificial intelligence developed by Google Brain Team. It provides a comprehensive ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML powered applications.
