Based on the given context, it is not possible to provide a direct answer to the query about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, some general information can be inferred from the text regarding the collection and processing of data related to Amur tiger trails.

In this study, trails were collected from free-ranging Amur tigers, which likely involved tracking and identifying individual animals based on their footprints or other physical evidence. Sub-trails were then created when more than ten footprints existed within a single trail. This process suggests that some form of manual annotation was performed to identify and classify these features.

Additionally, the context mentions the extraction of various variables from footprint images, including lengths, angles, and areas. These measurements could have been obtained through different types of annotations such as point annotation, line annotation, or polygon annotation depending on the specific feature being measured.

However, without explicit mention of the use of bounding boxes, instance segmentation, or other common deep learning annotation techniques, it cannot be confirmed whether these methods were employed in this particular study. Therefore, further details would be required to accurately address the query regarding the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
