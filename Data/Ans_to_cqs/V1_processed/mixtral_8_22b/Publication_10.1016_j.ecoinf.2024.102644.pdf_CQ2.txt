The text does not provide explicit information about the specific format of the data used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions using data from a public authoritative repository of big data (GBIF), which is likely to contain various types of data such as images or CSV files. Additionally, the mention of obtaining 17 datasets suggests that structured data formats like CSV might be used. The text also refers to'species observation data,' implying that visual data like images could potentially be part of the dataset. Nevertheless, without more specific details, it cannot be definitively stated what exact data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline.
