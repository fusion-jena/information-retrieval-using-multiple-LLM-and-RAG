The text provides insight into the use of non-invasive survey methods for collecting data on rare species occurring across large areas. These methods include FIT, camera traps, acoustic recorders, non-invasive genetic sampling (scat, hair, urine, feathers), and track collection. The authors emphasize the importance of expanding non-invasive survey data beyond just species presence/absence to sex identification, which is crucial for conservation efforts. They also mention the challenges associated with identifying sex using non-invasive genetic samples due to factors like cost, laboratory access, and DNA quantity and quality. However, they do not explicitly discuss the application of these methods within a deep learning pipeline. Nonetheless, it can be inferred that these non-invasive survey methods could serve as sources of raw data for deep learning models aimed at species and sex discrimination, among other tasks related to wildlife conservation.
