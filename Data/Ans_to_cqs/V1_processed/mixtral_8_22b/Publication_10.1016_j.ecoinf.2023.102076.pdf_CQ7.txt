The data was split based on several criteria depending on the classification task. For the initial dataset, the relevant texts from the predictions made by the best performing classifier were used as data from which training, development, and testing sets were selected for the next classification task. In another case, a balanced stratified sample was used where data were grouped according to their initial exploitation-related query term (stemmed), resulting in 19 groups. From each group, 110 texts for labeling were randomly selected, ensuring each query group was equally represented in the data. This approach effectively undersampled certain texts, allowing the classifier to be trained with the full breadth of topics within the dataset. Additionally, for each classification task, after experiments had been conducted, the best performing classifier was used to classify the entire dataset.
