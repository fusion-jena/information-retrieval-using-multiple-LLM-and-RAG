The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, common practices often involve data normalization or scaling, where features are rescaled to a standard range, typically between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. This helps prevent certain features with larger scales from dominating the learning process. Data cleaning is another crucial step, involving handling missing values, removing outliers, and correcting inconsistent entries. Additionally, encoding categorical variables into numerical form may be necessary if the model requires numeric input. Lastly, splitting the dataset into training, validation, and testing subsets is important for evaluating model performance accurately.
