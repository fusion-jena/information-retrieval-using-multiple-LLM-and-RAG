Based on the given context, there is no information about the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, and shifting. These techniques help increase the amount of training data and improve the generalization capabilities of the model. It should also be noted that the choice of data augmentation technique depends on the nature of the problem and the dataset being used.
