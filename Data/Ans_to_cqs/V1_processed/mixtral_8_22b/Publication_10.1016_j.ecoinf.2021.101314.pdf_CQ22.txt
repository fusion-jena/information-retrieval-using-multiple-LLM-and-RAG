The text does not provide information on the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. However, it mentions that the accuracy of the redescriptions was used as a criterion for selecting them for further analysis. Accuracy is a commonly used metric in machine learning and deep learning models, which measures the proportion of correct predictions out of the total number of predictions made. Additionally, the Jaccard coefficient is mentioned as a measure of accuracy gain when extending a candidate query. The Jaccard coefficient is a similarity measure between two sets, often used in natural language processing and information retrieval tasks. It calculates the ratio of the size of the intersection of two sets divided by the size of their union.
