The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, there is a reference to Castillo, O., 2020, which discusses early diagnosis of Covid-19 affected patients based on X-ray and computed tomography images using deep learning algorithms. Therefore, it can be inferred that the deep learning pipeline might involve image data formats such as X-rays or CT scans. Additionally, the mention of 'Big Data' suggests that the dataset may include various types of structured and unstructured data, potentially including formats like CSV, JSON, XML, etc. Nevertheless, without more detailed information, it cannot be definitively stated what exact data formats are utilized in the deep learning pipeline.
