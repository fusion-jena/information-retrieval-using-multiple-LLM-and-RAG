The data repository of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, the authors mention using data from two major biodiversity databases - the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS). They also note that they followed the data curation process outlined by Zizka et al. (2020). Unfortunately, the context does not provide any specific details about where the final cleaned dataset or the deep learning pipeline itself is stored or shared. Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot determine the exact location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline.
