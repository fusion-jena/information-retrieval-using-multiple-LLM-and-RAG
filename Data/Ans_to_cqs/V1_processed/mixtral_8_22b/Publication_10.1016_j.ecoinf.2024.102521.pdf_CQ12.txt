Based on the given information, it appears that the pipeline uses a ResNet152 model, which is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This can be seen from the description of the STARdbi\_train module, where it states that the output is a binary pickle file containing a ResNet152 model. Therefore, we can conclude that the pipeline employs a CNN architecture, specifically the ResNet152 variant.
