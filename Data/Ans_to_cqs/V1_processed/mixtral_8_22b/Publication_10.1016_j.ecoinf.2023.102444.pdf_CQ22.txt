To evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, several metrics can be used. In this case, the authors use the maximum information coefficient (MIC) to measure the amount of information shared by each pair of features. This metric has the advantage of considering a diverse array of relationships, not only linear ones. Additionally, they estimate another set of indices using the package PresenceAbsence to evaluate the performance of UMAP as a binary classifier. These include the area under the curve (AUC), receiver operating characteristics (ROC), kappa index K, and the point-biserial correlation (COR) index. The AUC ranges from 0 to 1, where values close to 1 indicate a better model. Similarly, the kappa index ranges from -1 to 1, with values close to 1 indicating a better model. The COR index is like the correlation coefficient but applied to a binary response. These indices are commonly used to assess species distribution models.
