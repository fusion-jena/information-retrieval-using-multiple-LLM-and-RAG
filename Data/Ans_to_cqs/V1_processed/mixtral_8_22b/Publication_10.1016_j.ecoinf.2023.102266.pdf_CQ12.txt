The information provided does not explicitly mention the use of any specific deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. However, there is a reference to applying machine learning techniques to modify the update criterion and turning the model into an intelligent cellular automaton. It also mentions investigating and developing new and more sophisticated estimators using variance reduction strategies like importance sampling, stratified sampling, and Quasi-Monte Carlo methods. Therefore, based on this context, it cannot be determined what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline.
