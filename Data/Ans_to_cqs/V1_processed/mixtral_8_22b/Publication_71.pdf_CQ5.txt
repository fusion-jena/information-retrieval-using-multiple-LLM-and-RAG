The paper does not provide explicit information about the specific dataset(s) used in their deep learning pipeline. The authors mention using the default DeepLabV3+ architecture, which was initially developed for semantic segmentation tasks on various benchmark datasets like PASCAL VOC, Cityscapes, and ADE20K. However, they do not explicitly state whether these datasets were utilized in their study. Furthermore, the table containing the training parameters used in DeepLabV3+ does not specify any particular dataset either. Therefore, based on the given context, it is unclear what datasets were employed in their deep learning pipeline.
