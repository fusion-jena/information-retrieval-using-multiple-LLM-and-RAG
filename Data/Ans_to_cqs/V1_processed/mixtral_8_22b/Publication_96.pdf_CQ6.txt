Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be applied to improve its performance. These may include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing or correcting any errors, inconsistencies, or missing values in the dataset. For example, if some pixels in the Landsat 8 imagery have no data due to sensor malfunction or atmospheric interference, these should be removed or filled in appropriately.

2. Feature Selection: Not all features (or variables) in a dataset may contribute equally to the task at hand. Therefore, selecting relevant features is crucial. In this case, the authors chose to use only certain spectral bands (red, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared) and indices (NDVI, NBR, and delta NBR) known to be sensitive to fire events.

3. Data Transformation: This refers to converting raw data into a more suitable format for the model. Common transformations include normalization and standardization. However, the paper does not explicitly mention whether these were performed.

4. Data Augmentation: To increase the amount of training data and prevent overfitting, synthetic examples can be generated through various means like rotation, flipping, zooming, etc. Again, the paper does not indicate whether this technique was employed.
