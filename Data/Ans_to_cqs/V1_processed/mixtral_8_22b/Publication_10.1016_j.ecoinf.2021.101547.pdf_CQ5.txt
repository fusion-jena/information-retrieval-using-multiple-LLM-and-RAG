The dataset used in this deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned among the commonly known datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it is stated that the freely available residual network ResNet-50 was used, which had been pre-trained on more than one million images from the ImageNet database. This suggests that the ImageNet dataset was utilized in the initial training phase of the model. Additionally, the authors mention using a significantly imbalanced training image set containing both a large variety of background images and a minimum number of polar bear images. Therefore, it can be inferred that the custom dataset used for further training and fine-tuning the model consisted primarily of polar bear and background images.
