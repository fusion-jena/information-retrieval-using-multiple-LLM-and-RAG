Based on the given context, there isn't explicit mention of specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training such as train, test, and validation sets. However, it can be inferred that due to the limited geographical area and the resulting limitation in the number of potential tweets, the authors did not make significant efforts to train an image recognition model using deep learning techniques. This suggests that they might not have had enough data to effectively use a separate validation set during the training process. Nonetheless, without more detailed information regarding the data splitting methods employed in this study, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer.
