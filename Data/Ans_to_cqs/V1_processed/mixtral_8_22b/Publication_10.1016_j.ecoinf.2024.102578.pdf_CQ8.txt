The article does not provide information on where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The authors do not mention any specific platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. To find this information, one would need to contact the corresponding author or search online resources related to their work.

Based on the given context, it appears that the paper focuses on using a deep learning pipeline with ResNet-50 and MegaDetector models for Arctic wildlife monitoring using time-lapse cameras. However, there is no explicit mention of where the code repository for this pipeline can be found. Therefore, without additional information, it is impossible to determine the exact location of the code repository.
