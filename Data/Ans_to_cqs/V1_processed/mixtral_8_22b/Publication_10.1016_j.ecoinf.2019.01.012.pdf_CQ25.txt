The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in this context is image classification. Specifically, it aims to automatically classify digital images based on their content. This is achieved through the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is well-suited for image analysis due to its ability to extract spatial features. The model is trained to distinguish between different classes of objects or elements within the images, such as woody vegetation versus other types of land cover like grass, soil, buildings, humans, animals, sky, water, stones, and asphalt. The ultimate goal is to apply this trained classifier to whole images, where it will predict the output for each individual tile and then reassemble them back into the original image size.
