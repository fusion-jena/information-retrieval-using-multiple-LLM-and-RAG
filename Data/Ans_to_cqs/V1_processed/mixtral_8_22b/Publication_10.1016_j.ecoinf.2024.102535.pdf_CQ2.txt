The given context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the context that the primary focus is on image data, specifically deep-sea images. This is evident from phrases like "substratum classification," "seabed mineral image segmentation," and references to various papers related to image processing and computer vision. Therefore, it can be concluded that the data format primarily used in the deep learning pipeline is likely image data.
