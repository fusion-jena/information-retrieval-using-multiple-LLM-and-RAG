The pipeline uses a specific type of deep learning model known as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This can be deduced from various parts of the given context. For instance, it mentions that the chosen CNN architectures have an encoder stage, often referred to as a feature extractor, which employs convolution and pooling operations to reduce the spatial resolution of the input images. Furthermore, the text discusses the VGG network, which is a well-known CNN architecture designed for image classification tasks. Lastly, Appendix A explicitly states that the evaluated models in the experiments are based on different architectures, including VGG, ResNet, and Xception, all of which are types of CNNs. Therefore, it can be concluded that the pipeline utilizes CNNs as its primary deep learning model.
