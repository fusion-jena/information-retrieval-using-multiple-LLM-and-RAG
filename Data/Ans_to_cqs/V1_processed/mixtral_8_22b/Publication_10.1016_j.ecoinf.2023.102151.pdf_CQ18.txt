The provided sources do not directly address the specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. The given references primarily focus on topics such as principles of irrigation scheduling, understanding soil water thresholds, visualizing water quality models, designing gardens without irrigation, modeling olive trees, evaluating landscapes, imaging root growth processes, exchanging soil and terrain data, estimating solar radiation and evapotranspiration, automatic metro map layout, and linking landscape and soil profile evolution. To provide an accurate response regarding monitoring model performance during training, additional resources or context would be required.
