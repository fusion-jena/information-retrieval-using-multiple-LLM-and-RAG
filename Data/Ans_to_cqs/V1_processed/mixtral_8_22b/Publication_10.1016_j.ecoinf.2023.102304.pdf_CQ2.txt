The given context primarily discusses remote sensing techniques and spectral indices such as BFAST, EVI, NDVI, NBR, Tasseled Cap Index, etc., used for analyzing different types of forests like conifer, deciduous, mixed, Mediterranean, boreal, tropical, savanna, etc. It also mentions Google Earth Engine, a platform for processing satellite imagery, and several research papers related to this topic. However, there is no explicit mention of specific data formats used in a deep learning pipeline within the provided context. Therefore, based solely on the information available, we cannot determine what data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline.
