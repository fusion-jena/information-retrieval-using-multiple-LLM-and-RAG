The text does not provide explicit information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. It mentions the use of Python and fastai for developing the deep learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), but it does not specify whether techniques such as grid search or random search were employed for hyperparameter optimization. Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot determine the method used for hyperparameter optimization.
