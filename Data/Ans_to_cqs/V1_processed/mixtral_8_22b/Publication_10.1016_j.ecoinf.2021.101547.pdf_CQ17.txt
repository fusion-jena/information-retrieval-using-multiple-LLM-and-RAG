Regularization methods are techniques used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting, where the model becomes too complex and starts fitting the noise in the training data instead of the underlying pattern. Two common regularization methods mentioned in the given context are dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent overfitting by making the layer look-like and train many independent networks within itself. This forces the network to spread out the learned weights among multiple neurons, reducing the dependence on any single neuron and thus preventing overfitting.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. By adding this penalty term, the optimization algorithm tries to minimize both the original loss function and the sum of squared weights, effectively shrinking the weights towards zero. This results in simpler models with smaller weights, which are less likely to overfit the training data.

In summary, dropout and L2 regularization are two popular regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting. Dropout achieves this by ignoring random neurons during training, while L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function to shrink the weights towards zero.
