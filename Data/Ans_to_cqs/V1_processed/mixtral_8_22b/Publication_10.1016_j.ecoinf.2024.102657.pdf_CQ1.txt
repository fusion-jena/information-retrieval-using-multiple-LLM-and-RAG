The paper does not provide explicit details about the method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the bird song data is stored in folders labeled with the dialect type and the year it was collected. This suggests that the data might have been gathered through field recordings over multiple years. Additionally, the authors state that they created a metadata.csv file listing all the necessary classification information for training the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN). This implies that the raw data collection process involved gathering relevant metadata along with the audio files. Unfortunately, without more specific information, I cannot definitively determine the exact method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
