The text does not provide specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that researchers face challenges due to a lack of data in cation studies. It also states that the compiled data contributes to the largest fully labeled snow leopard dataset for deep learning research. Additionally, the authors anticipate that their novel deep learning methods will encourage other academics to contribute more datasets to Whiskerbook.org. This suggests that the data collection process likely involves gathering labeled images of snow leopards from various sources, possibly including surveys, sensors, or public datasets, but the exact methods are not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
