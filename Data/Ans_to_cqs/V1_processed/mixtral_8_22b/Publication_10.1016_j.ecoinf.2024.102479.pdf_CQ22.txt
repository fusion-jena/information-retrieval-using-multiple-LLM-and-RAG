Based on the given context, it does not provide specific information about the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model such as accuracy, precision, or recall. However, it mentions that Grid Search Cross Validation (GSCV) is used to identify the most effective set of hyperparameters that enhance the model's performance during training. Additionally, k-fold cross-validation is employed to assess the performance of the models, which is a widely used evaluation method in machine learning. Therefore, based on the context provided, we can infer that the performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using techniques like grid search cross validation and k-fold cross-validation, but the specific metrics used to measure the performance are not mentioned.
