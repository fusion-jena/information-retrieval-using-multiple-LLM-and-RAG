In the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization being used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, the authors do discuss their approach to preventing overfitting through various means. They employ data augmentation techniques like shearing, translating, and mirroring images during training, ensuring that the network does not see the exact same image twice. This helps improve generalization and reduce overfitting. Additionally, they use transfer learning by initializing the weights of their model with pretrained weights from the ImageNet dataset, which can also help mitigate overfitting. While these strategies may not be traditional regularization methods, they still contribute to reducing overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
