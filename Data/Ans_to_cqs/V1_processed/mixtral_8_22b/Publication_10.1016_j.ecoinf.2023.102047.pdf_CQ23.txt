Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model such as using diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, some clues can be found regarding the use of various techniques for improving the model's performance and stability.

For instance, the text mentions that EfficientDet uses EfficientNet as its backbone, which integrates a compound scaling technique that uniformly scales resolution, depth, and width of the network. This helps achieve maximum accuracy and efficiency under limited computing resources. Additionally, the EfficientDet family includes several networks of varying dimensions, allowing for different levels of accuracy and efficiency. These aspects suggest that the model has been designed to handle diverse scenarios and resource constraints effectively.

Moreover, the context discusses different methods for feature fusion, including unbounded fusion, softmax-based fusion, and fast normalized fusion. Each method aims to improve the overall performance of the model by combining features from multiple sources efficiently. Weight normalization is employed to bound the value range of each weight and prevent training instability. Similarly, the softmax activation function is utilized to normalize all weights to be a probability within a range of 0 to 1. Although not directly related to ensuring generalizability, these techniques contribute to enhancing the robustness and adaptability of the deep learning model.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly detail specific measures for ensuring the generalizability of the deep learning model, it provides insights into various strategies adopted to enhance the model's performance, stability, and adaptability across diverse conditions.
