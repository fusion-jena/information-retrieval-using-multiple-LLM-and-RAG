The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the provided context is not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred from the information given that the deep learning model was used for classification purposes. Halgamuge et al. (2020) focused on utilizing deep learning to estimate the best optimizer selection methods for wildfire event predictions in Australia. They developed an algorithm to collect the data automatically and analyzed six different optimizer models using deep learning technology. Their conclusion suggests that this approach could predict natural disasters, including wildfire events, by investigating historical environmental conditions before and after wildfires occurred using the deep learning methodology. Therefore, it can be assumed that the deep learning model was employed for classifying or predicting wildfire events based on historical environmental data.
