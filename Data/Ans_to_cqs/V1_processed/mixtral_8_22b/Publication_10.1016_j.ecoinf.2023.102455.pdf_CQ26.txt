Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it does discuss the use of data pre-processing methods combined with ML models to supply more comprehensive information for the prediction/forecasting matrix, increasing the modeling capability of a standalone prediction model used for Qflow modeling. It also mentions the importance of setting hyperparameters and their structural architecture when executing ML-based predictive models. Additionally, the context highlights the use of metaheuristic optimization algorithms and cross-validation schemes for parameter tuning. Nevertheless, without further context, it cannot be determined if these techniques were specifically applied to address data bias.
