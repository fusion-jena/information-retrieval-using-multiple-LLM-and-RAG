The article does not provide information on where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that Google Earth Engine (GEE) was used for handling massive amounts of data due to its powerful data storage and high computational capacity. However, there is no mention of any specific data repository or platform where the data used in the study has been made publicly available. Therefore, without additional information, it cannot be determined where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
