The context does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it can be inferred that the study uses some form of splitting methodology due to its use of deep learning models. Common practices include random sampling, stratified sampling, or time-based splits depending on the specific requirements and characteristics of the dataset. Without further details, it would be speculative to determine the exact criteria used in this particular case.
