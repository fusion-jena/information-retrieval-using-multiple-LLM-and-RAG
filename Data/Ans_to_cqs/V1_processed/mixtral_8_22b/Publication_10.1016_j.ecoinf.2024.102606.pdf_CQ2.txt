The text does not explicitly mention the exact data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, we can infer that the primary data format used is images. This is evident from phrases such as "image regions," "object classification," "Yolov5 input dimensions," and references to the ImageNet dataset, which consists primarily of images. Additionally, there are mentions of tasks involving "species identification" and "identifying the most frequent and common species of Collembola," which typically involve analyzing visual data, i.e., images. Therefore, while not explicitly stated, it appears that the main data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images.
