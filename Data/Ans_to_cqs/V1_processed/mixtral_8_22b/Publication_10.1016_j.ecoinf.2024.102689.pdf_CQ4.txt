The given context does not provide specific information about the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipelines mentioned. However, common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, translation, and noise injection. These techniques help increase the amount of training data available and improve the generalizability of models by introducing variations into the dataset. It is likely that some or all of these techniques were used in the deep learning pipelines discussed in the context, but without explicit mention, it cannot be confirmed which ones were specifically utilized.
