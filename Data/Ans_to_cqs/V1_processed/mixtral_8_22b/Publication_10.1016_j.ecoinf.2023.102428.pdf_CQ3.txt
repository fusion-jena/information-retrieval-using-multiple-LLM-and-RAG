Based on the given context, there is no information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for this particular study. However, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and landmark annotation. These techniques help label the dataset with relevant information required for training deep learning models. In the case of this study, since it involves LULC simulation using MLPnn-MC modeling, it can be assumed that some form of image annotation technique might have been used to prepare the dataset for training the MLP neural network. But without explicit mention in the context, we cannot confirm the exact data annotation techniques used in this study.
