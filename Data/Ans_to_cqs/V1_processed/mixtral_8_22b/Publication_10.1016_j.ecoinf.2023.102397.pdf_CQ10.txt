Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to provide a direct link to the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be noted that the paper mentions using the R package'monitoR', developed by Hafner and Katz. This might suggest that the authors have utilized this package in their workflow. To find more details about the specific implementation of the deep learning pipeline, I would recommend checking the references mentioned in the paper, such as Benkendorf and Hawkins (2020) and Breiman (2001), as well as looking into the documentation and source code of the'monitoR' package itself.
