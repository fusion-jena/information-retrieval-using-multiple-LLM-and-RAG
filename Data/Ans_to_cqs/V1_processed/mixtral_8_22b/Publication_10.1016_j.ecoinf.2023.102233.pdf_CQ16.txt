Iterative model training stopped when the stopping criterion was reached, which was when successive model iterations did not reduce the F1 score. This means that the training process continued until there was no further improvement in the F1 score, indicating that the model had learned all it could from the available data. In other words, the model had converged and additional training would not improve its performance. This approach helps prevent overfitting by avoiding unnecessary training cycles once the model has already learned what it can from the data.
