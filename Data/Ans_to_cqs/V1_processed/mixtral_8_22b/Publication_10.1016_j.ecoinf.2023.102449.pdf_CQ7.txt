The context does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, common practices include splitting the dataset randomly or stratified based on class labels. Typically, the dataset is divided into three parts: training, validation, and testing sets. The training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set helps tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Lastly, the testing set evaluates the model's performance on unseen data.

Based on the given context, it can be assumed that similar practices were followed during the development of this deep learning model. However, without specific details regarding the dataset and its distribution, it is impossible to determine the exact criteria used for splitting the data.
