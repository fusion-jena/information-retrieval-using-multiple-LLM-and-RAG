In evaluating the performance of the deep learning model, several metrics can be employed. These include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the curve (AUC). Accuracy is the ratio of correct predictions made by the model out of all predictions. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions. Recall calculates the fraction of relevant instances retrieved out of all relevant instances. The F1 score combines both precision and recall into a single metric. Lastly, the AUC represents the degree or measure of separability between classes. In the given context, the performance of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was evaluated using the model residuals obtained from multiple runs, which were analyzed for a more reliable evaluation of the model performance. Additionally, the mean deviance of the model response from SPAD value measurements was calculated along with its confidence interval.
