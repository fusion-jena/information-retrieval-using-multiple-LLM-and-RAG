The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, there is a reference to a study using deep learning models for classifying three sympatric otter species. It mentions that a model trained on images of all qualities was only marginally outperformed by a model trained on high-quality prints. This suggests that some form of data augmentation might have been employed to improve the performance of the model trained on low-quality images. Nevertheless, without more detailed information about the study, it is impossible to determine which specific data augmentation techniques were utilized.
