The given context does not provide direct information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it discusses various aspects related to computational statistics algorithms, particle filtering, and resampling methods.

To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into subsets called strata, ensuring that each subset maintains the original class distribution. It helps prevent imbalanced classes during training and testing phases.

2. Oversampling: To counteract class imbalance, this method increases the number of instances in the minority class by duplicating existing samples or creating synthetic ones using interpolation techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Overpopulation Technique).

3. Undersampling: Contrary to oversampling, this approach reduces the size of the majority class by randomly removing some instances or employing more sophisticated techniques like NearMiss or Condensed Nearest Neighbor Rule.

4. Diverse data collection: Collecting a wide range of data with varying characteristics can help mitigate biases introduced due to limited representation within certain groups or categories. This includes gathering data from different sources, demographics, geographical locations, etc.
