The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that its primary function is forecasting or predicting the percentage disease incidence of Cotton Leaf Curl Disease (CLCuD) in upland cotton. This is evident from the use of deep learning models such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and other machine learning models like bootstrap forest and boosted tree. These models are trained using various weather parameters including minimum, maximum, and average temperatures, standard meteorological week (SMW)-wise growing degree days (GDD), minimum relative humidity (RHmini.), maximum relative humidity (RHmax.), average relative humidity (RHave.), cumulative rainfall (mm), and whitefly per three leaves. The goal seems to be to create a predictive model that can estimate the likelihood of CLCuD occurrence based on these environmental factors. However, without explicit confirmation, we cannot definitively state that the sole purpose of the deep learning model is for prediction or forecasting.
