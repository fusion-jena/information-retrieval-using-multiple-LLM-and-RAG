Based on the given information, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly mentioned as either Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer. However, the text does mention that the neural networks were built from scratch using TensorFlow and Keras, and that the networks consist of an input layer, two hidden layers, and an output layer. This suggests that the model used is likely a feedforward neural network, also known as a multilayer perceptron (MLP).

Furthermore, the description mentions that the hidden layers use 'ReLU' (Rectified Linear Unit) as their activation function, which is commonly used in feedforward neural networks. Additionally, the fact that dropout regularization is applied to the hidden layers further supports the idea that the model is a feedforward neural network.

Therefore, although the exact type of deep learning model is not specified, based on the available information, it appears that the model used in the pipeline is most likely a feedforward neural network.
