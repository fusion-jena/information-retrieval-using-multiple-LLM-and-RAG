Unfortunately, based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It could be possible that the authors did not provide this information or it might have been published elsewhere. Therefore, without additional context or resources, it is impossible to determine the exact location of the data repository.
