Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The context only mentions that machine learning and deep learning techniques have been applied to analyze data generated by sensors and IoT devices in smart farming. It also notes that traditional data management systems may be inadequate to handle the volume, velocity, and variety of such data. Therefore, it can be inferred that the authors might have considered these challenges while developing their models, but without further details, we cannot confirm the exact measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
