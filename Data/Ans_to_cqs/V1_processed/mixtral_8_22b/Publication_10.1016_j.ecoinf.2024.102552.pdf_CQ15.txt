The given context does not provide specific details about optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it discusses the application of machine learning methods for image classification tasks, specifically in the context of ecological studies. The authors mention the use of "human in the loop" classification, which suggests the involvement of active learning or semi-supervised learning approaches. They also highlight the potential benefits of incorporating additional sources of information like online spectral libraries or other remote sensing products to improve the accuracy of classifications. Furthermore, the text emphasizes the importance of high-quality input data and cautions against relying solely on automated methods when dealing with historical imagery due to its variability. In summary, while the context does not directly address optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines, it focuses on various aspects of applying machine learning methods for image classification tasks in ecology.
