To ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model, several measures were implemented. Firstly, diverse datasets were used, which included RFE2021, RFE2011–2021, VSURF2021, and VSURF2011–2021. These datasets were created by applying feature elimination techniques such as Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Variable Selection Using Random Forests (VSURF), resulting in four retained databases. Secondly, spatial cross-validation was employed during the analysis process. This technique involves dividing the study area into smaller subsets or folds, where each fold is used once as a validation set while the remaining folds serve as the training set. Lastly, the model training and spatial mapping were conducted using R programming language, specifically utilizing the Caret package for classification and regression training and the VSURF package for variable selection.
