The text does not explicitly mention specific datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it mentions that the U-Net model implemented within arcgis.learn had a ResNet-50 backbone that was pretrained on ImageNet. This suggests that ImageNet was used during the pretraining phase of the model. Furthermore, the text also states that abundant data are needed for training deep neural networks, implying that large datasets similar to those mentioned above might have been utilized. However, without explicit information about the exact datasets used, we cannot definitively state which ones were employed in the deep learning pipeline.
