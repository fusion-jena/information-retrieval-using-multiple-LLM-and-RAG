The text does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, including managing random seed values. However, it mentions that the authors used deep learning techniques, specifically Faster R-CNN, to detect and annotate plant organs from digitized herbarium scans. In general, when working with deep learning models like Faster R-CNN, one common strategy to manage randomness is setting a fixed random seed value before training the model. By doing so, researchers ensure reproducibility and consistency across experiments. Additionally, some popular deep learning libraries, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, offer built-in functions to control randomness during initialization and operations. These functions allow users to set seeds for various sources of randomness, ensuring deterministic behavior in their models.
