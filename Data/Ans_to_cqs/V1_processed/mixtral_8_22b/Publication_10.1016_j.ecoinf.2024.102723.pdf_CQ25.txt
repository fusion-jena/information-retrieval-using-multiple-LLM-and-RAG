The purpose of the deep learning model discussed here is not explicitly stated as either classification, segmentation, or detection. However, given the context, it appears that the primary goal of the neural network architecture described is to perform regression tasks. This is evident from several clues throughout the text. Firstly, the output layer of the network is designed to handle regression problems, as indicated by its composition of a dense layer with two nodes and a DistributionLambda layer that maps the outputs into the parameters of a Gaussian distribution. Secondly, the figures presented show predictions of continuous variables rather than discrete classes or object locations, further supporting the idea that the model is intended for regression tasks. Lastly, the discussion around Bayesian Neural Networks emphasizes their ability to quantify uncertainty in predictions, which is particularly relevant when dealing with regression problems. Therefore, although not directly mentioned, it can be inferred that the purpose of the deep learning model is to perform regression tasks.
