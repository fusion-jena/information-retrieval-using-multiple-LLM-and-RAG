The given context does not provide information about specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Instead, it focuses on optimizing hyperparameters for deep learning models applied to image processing and remote sensing tasks like land-use and land-cover classification. Therefore, based on this context, we cannot determine which data annotation techniques have been employed in their deep learning pipeline.
