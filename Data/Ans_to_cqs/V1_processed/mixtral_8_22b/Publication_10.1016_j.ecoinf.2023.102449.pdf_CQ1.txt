The text does not provide explicit information on the method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of acoustic surveys, which suggests that audio recordings might be one source of raw data. Additionally, there is a reference to a link for a data repository in Appendix B, indicating that publicly available datasets could also be part of the data collection process. Unfortunately, without more specific information, I cannot definitively state what methods are being used for collecting raw data in this particular case.
