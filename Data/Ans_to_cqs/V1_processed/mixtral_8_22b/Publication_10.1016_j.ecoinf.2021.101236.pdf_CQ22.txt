The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using both sample-wise (mAP) and class-wise mean average precision (cmAP) metrics. These metrics have been used in past editions of BirdCLEF and are suitable for multi-label classification scenarios. Additionally, other complementary metrics such as top-1 accuracy, F0.5 score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC) are employed to further assess the model's performance.
