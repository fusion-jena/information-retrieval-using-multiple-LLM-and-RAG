The pipeline uses a deep learning model called the Bird's Eye View (BEV) Faster Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) algorithm. This model is a variant of the popular Faster R-CNN architecture, which is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The BEV Faster R-CNN algorithm is specifically designed for processing LiDAR data and is used here for segmentation tasks related to tree canopy identification in urban areas.
