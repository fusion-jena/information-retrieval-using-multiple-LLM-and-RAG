The text does not explicitly mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does indicate that the performance of the model was tested on both a validation set and a separate test set. This approach helps to evaluate the ability of the model to perform well on new, unseen data, thereby ensuring its generalizability. Additionally, the use of augmentation techniques could also contribute to improving the model's robustness and generalization capabilities.
