The provided context does not directly discuss specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. However, it does mention the use of data points distributed over a study area, which suggests the collection of geospatial data. Additionally, there is reference to environmental measurements, which implies the use of sensors or other measurement tools. It would be best to consult additional sources for more detailed information about specific data collection methods used in deep learning pipelines.
