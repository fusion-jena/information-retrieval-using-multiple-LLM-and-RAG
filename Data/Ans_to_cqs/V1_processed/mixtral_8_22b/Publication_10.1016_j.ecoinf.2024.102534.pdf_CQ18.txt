The text does not provide explicit information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions that the Area Under Curve (AUC) evaluation metric and True Skill Statistics (TSS) were used to assess the performance of model predictions. This suggests that these metrics might have been employed to evaluate the model's performance during training. Additionally, the threshold value of 0.6 was derived from equal training sensitivity and specificity, which could indicate a method used to optimize the model's performance during training. Nevertheless, without more specific details regarding the training process, it is difficult to definitively state what strategy was implemented to monitor the model performance during training.
