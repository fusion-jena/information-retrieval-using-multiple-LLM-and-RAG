The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, based on the table presented, it can be inferred that the model might have been used for detecting and classifying different patterns or variants of songs. This is suggested by the columns "% Tracking Sample" and "% Detections", which indicate percentages related to detected vocalizations of each song variant or pattern. Therefore, it seems likely that the deep learning model was employed for the purpose of detecting and classifying these song structures.
