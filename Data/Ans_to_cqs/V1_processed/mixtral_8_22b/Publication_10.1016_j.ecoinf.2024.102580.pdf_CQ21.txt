The text does not provide explicit information about the specific post-processing steps taken after the model training. However, we can infer some possible post-processing techniques based on common practices in machine learning projects. These may include generating saliency maps to visualize important features contributing to predictions, calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to assess model performance, or creating confusion matrices to understand misclassifications between classes. In this study, Fig. 6 shows the accuracy, precision, and recall of models retrained on incremental datasets, suggesting that these metrics might have been calculated during post-processing. Additionally, the mention of reducing human error through training implies that there could be manual verification or correction processes involved in post-processing.
