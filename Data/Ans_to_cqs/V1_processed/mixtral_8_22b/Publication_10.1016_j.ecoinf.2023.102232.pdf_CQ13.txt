Unfortunately, there isn't enough information about the specific deep learning model being used or any details regarding its hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer. Therefore, I cannot provide accurate information on the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. Please provide more context or details about the model so I can give a helpful response.
