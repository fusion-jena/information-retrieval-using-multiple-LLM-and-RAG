The text does not explicitly mention the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions that inspections of residual plots were conducted to assess the goodness of the model, which suggests that monitoring was done post-training rather than during training. Additionally, the use of a leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) approach indicates that the model's performance was evaluated after its creation. Therefore, while there isn't explicit information on the strategy used to monitor the model performance during training, these details suggest that evaluations occurred after the completion of the training process.
