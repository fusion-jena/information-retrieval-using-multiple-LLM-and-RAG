The article does not provide explicit information about the specific preprocessing steps used before training the deep learning models. However, common practices in image classification and object detection tasks often involve resizing images to a standard size, converting them into grayscale or applying color augmentation techniques, normalizing pixel values, and splitting datasets into training and validation sets. These preprocessing steps may vary depending on the chosen architecture and task requirements.
