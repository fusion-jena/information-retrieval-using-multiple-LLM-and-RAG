The papers cited provide several examples of how raw data can be collected for deep learning pipelines in ecology and ornithology. In general, there are three main sources of raw data: surveys, sensors, and public datasets.

Surveys involve human observers who collect data through direct observation or recording of bird sounds. For example, Priyadarshani et al. (2018) used automated birdsong recognition in complex acoustic environments to identify different bird species. Similarly, Quinn et al. (2022) used soundscapes to reveal temporal and geographic patterns in ecoacoustic data. These studies demonstrate the importance of human expertise in identifying and labeling bird sounds accurately.

Sensors are another source of raw data for deep learning pipelines. For instance, Roca et al. (2022) used passive acoustic monitoring devices to record bird sounds continuously over time. This approach allows researchers to capture a more comprehensive dataset of bird sounds without relying solely on human observations. Additionally, sensors can be deployed in remote locations where human access may be difficult or impossible.

Public datasets are also valuable resources for deep learning pipelines. Many publicly available datasets contain large amounts of labeled data that can be used to train machine learning models. For example, Pouyanfar et al. (2018) conducted a survey on deep learning algorithms, techniques, and applications, including those related to ecology and ornithology. Public datasets can help overcome some of the challenges associated with collecting raw data, such as limited availability of expert knowledge or equipment.

However, it is important to note that not all public datasets are suitable for every application. As mentioned earlier, modern CNN classifiers typically perform best when trained with labeled data from within the study domain. Therefore, researchers must carefully consider whether a particular dataset is appropriate for their specific needs before incorporating it into their deep learning pipeline.

In summary, various methods are employed for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, including surveys, sensors, and public datasets. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages, depending on the specific requirements of the project. Researchers should carefully evaluate each option based on factors such as cost, feasibility, accuracy, and relevance to ensure optimal results.
