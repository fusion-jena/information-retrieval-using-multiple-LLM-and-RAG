Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to provide the exact data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. However, I can tell you that the authors used the librosa Python package for processing the audio data, which is available at <https://librosa.org/doc/latest/index.html>. They also mention that they collected around 10 million sound events lasting over 34,000 hours during their research. But without additional details about where this data has been stored or shared, I cannot provide the specific data repository link.
