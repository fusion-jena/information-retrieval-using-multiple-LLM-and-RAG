The query asks for the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the given context, there is no mention or information about any specific deep learning pipeline or its corresponding data repository link. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a direct answer to this query based solely on the provided context.

However, one of the sources mentioned in the context is the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), which is a data repository for biodiversity data. It was used to obtain the coordinates of the two oak species in the Iberian Peninsula. The link to access the GBIF database is <https://www.gbif.org/>. But again, without more specific details about the deep learning pipeline, it cannot be confirmed if this is the correct data repository link being asked for in the query.
