The given context does not provide any specific information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that the proposed method aligns DNA sequences to obtain sequences with the same length and converts them into numerical data using one-hot encoding. However, there is no mention of where the raw DNA sequence data was obtained or where the processed data was stored. Therefore, without additional context, it is impossible to provide the requested information.
