The provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotating, scaling, etc. However, it discusses the use of deep learning in biodiversity research, specifically in image recognition tasks like face recognition. Deep learning models often employ data augmentation techniques to improve their performance and generalization capabilities. Data augmentation involves creating new training samples by applying transformations to existing ones. Commonly used techniques include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, and color jittering. While the context does not provide explicit details about which data augmentation techniques were used, it is reasonable to assume that some combination of these techniques was likely employed during model development and training.
