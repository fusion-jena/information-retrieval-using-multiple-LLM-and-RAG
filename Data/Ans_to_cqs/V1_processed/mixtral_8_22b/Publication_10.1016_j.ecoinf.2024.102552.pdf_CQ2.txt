The text does not provide explicit information about the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of imagery multiple times, suggesting that the primary data format used in this case is likely image data. Additionally, the authors discuss incorporating spectral libraries and other remote sensing products, which further supports the idea that image data is being utilized. There is no mention of any other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV files. Therefore, based on the given context, we can infer that the main data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data.
