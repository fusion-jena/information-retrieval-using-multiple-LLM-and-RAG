The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using a linear combination of three different types of loss functions - the adversarial loss function, the L1 loss function, and the perceptual loss function. These loss functions help in facilitating the training of both the generator and discriminator networks in a competitive manner. The total loss function is calculated as a sum of these individual losses, where each loss term is scaled by its respective weight factor. The adversarial loss function encourages the generator to minimize the probability assigned by the discriminator to the generated samples. The L1 loss function helps in minimizing the absolute difference between the predicted and actual values, while the perceptual loss function focuses on preserving high-level features such as edges and textures in the generated images. By monitoring the overall loss during training, one can assess the performance of the model and adjust the learning rate or other hyperparameters accordingly.
