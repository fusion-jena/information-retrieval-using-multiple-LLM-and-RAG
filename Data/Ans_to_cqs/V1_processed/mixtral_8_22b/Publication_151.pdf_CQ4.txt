The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, or scaling. These techniques are commonly used in image processing tasks within deep learning pipelines but may not necessarily apply to other types of data like sequences or text. Therefore, based solely on the information provided, I cannot determine what data augmentation techniques were applied in this case.
