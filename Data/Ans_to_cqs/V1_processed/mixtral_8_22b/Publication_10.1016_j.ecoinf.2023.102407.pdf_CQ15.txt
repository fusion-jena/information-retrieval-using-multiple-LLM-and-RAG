The given context does not provide specific information about the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or adaptive moment estimation (Adam). However, it mentions the use of deep neural networks in pseudo-label: The simple and efficient semi-supervised learning method for deep neural networks by Lee, D.H. (2013). Deep learning pipelines often employ optimization techniques like SGD or Adam to minimize the loss function during model training. Without explicit mention in the provided context, we cannot definitively state which optimization technique is being used in this case.
