Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no explicit mention or reference to where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific location such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. It would require additional information beyond what has been provided to accurately determine the data repository's location.
