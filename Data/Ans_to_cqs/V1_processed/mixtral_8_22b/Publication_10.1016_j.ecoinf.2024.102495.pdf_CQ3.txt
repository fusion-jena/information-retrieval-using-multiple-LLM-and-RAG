Based on the provided context, there is no information about specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, the text does discuss the use of deep learning algorithms, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), for analyzing voice-recorded data. In this case, the feature extraction process involves generating a visual representation of the sound in the form of a spectrogram. The CNN then uses this visual representation to map patterns from the sound recording data. It should be noted that data annotation techniques like bounding box annotation and instance segmentation are typically associated with image data rather than audio data.
