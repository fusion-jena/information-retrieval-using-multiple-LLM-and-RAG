The study employs five metrics to assess the effectiveness of the proposed model, which are Accuracy (A), Precision (P), Recall (R), F1-score (F1), and Intersection over Union (IOU). The calculation formulas for these metrics can be found in section 2.6 of the paper. Specifically, the Res\_AUNet network achieved an Accuracy of 98.02%, an F1-score of 83.67%, and an IOU of 74.73% when tested on the WSGD dataset.
