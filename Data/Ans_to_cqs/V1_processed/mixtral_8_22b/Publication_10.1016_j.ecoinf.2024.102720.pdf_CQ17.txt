Regularization is a technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function during training. In the context of deep learning pipelines, two common regularization methods are Dropout and L2 Regularization.

Dropout is a regularization method where randomly selected neurons are ignored or "dropped out" during training, which helps to make the model more robust and prevents it from relying too heavily on any single feature. This can be particularly useful when dealing with large neural networks with many layers.

L2 Regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. This encourages smaller weights and makes the model less likely to overfit the training data. It can be implemented using techniques like Ridge Regression or Lasso Regression.

Other regularization methods include L1 Regularization, Early Stopping, and Data Augmentation. L1 Regularization adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute value of the weights, encouraging sparse solutions. Early Stopping stops training before the model starts to overfit, while Data Augmentation generates additional training examples by applying transformations to existing data.

These regularization methods help improve the generalization performance of deep learning models by reducing overfitting and improving their ability to handle new, unseen data.
