Unfortunately, there is no information available regarding the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. The given text does not provide any details about the use of deep learning models or their respective hyperparameters. Instead, it focuses on the methodology used to develop a predictive model using remote sensing data and topographic indices. The model was built using the'mgcv' library in R, employing automatic elimination of variables with minimal impact on the explained variable. Additionally, a gamma distribution with a natural logarithm as the linking function was utilized due to the skewed distribution of the modeled variable, Volumetric Water Content (VWC). Model accuracy was assessed using the 'yardstick' package for R, calculating three metrics: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R^2). Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot determine the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
