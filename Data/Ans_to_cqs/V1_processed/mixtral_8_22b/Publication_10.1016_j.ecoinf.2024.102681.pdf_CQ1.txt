The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the study uses a combination of historical data and publicly available datasets. The study mentions using a dataset spanning from January 1950 to December 2020, which suggests that they have collected historical data. Additionally, the use of a hybrid deep learning model (CNN-LSTM) implies that the authors may have also used existing public datasets or generated new ones through simulations or other means. Without further information, it cannot be definitively stated what specific methods were used for collecting raw data in this case.
