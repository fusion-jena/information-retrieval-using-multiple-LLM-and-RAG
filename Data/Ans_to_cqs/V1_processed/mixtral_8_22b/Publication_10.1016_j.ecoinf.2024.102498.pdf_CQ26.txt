The text does not provide specific information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that high-resolution images from Google Earth were utilized to collect appropriate labels, and two experts further reviewed the collected labels to ensure quality and accuracy. In general, some common techniques used to address data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of target variables in both sets. Oversampling increases the number of instances in the minority class, while undersampling reduces the number of instances in the majority class. Diverse data collection aims to gather data from various sources or locations to reduce bias caused by using data from only one source or location.

Based on the given context, we cannot determine which technique was specifically used in this case. However, collecting appropriate labels and reviewing them by experts could potentially help mitigate any biases introduced during data collection. Additionally, utilizing high-resolution images may also contribute to reducing potential biases related to image resolution or quality.
