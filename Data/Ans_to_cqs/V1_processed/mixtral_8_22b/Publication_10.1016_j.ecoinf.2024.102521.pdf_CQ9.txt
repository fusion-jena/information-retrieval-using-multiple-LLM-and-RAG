Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of where the data repository for the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it can be inferred from the text that the data generated through the STARdbi pipeline is uploaded to the STARdbi database using its web interface. Therefore, it seems likely that the data repository would be accessible via the STARdbi website or platform. Unfortunately, without more specific details about the STARdbi system, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding which external data repository service (such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF) might host the data.
