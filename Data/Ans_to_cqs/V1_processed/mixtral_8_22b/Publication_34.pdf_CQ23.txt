To ensure the generalizability of their deep learning approach to species distribution modelling, several measures were taken. Firstly, the authors chose to work with a high number of randomly chosen species to avoid bias towards any specific category of species. They started with 7626 initial species and narrowed down to 1000 species, then further reduced to 200 and finally 50 species. This process ensured diversity within the dataset. Secondly, the authors used different subsets of these species (E50, E200, E1000) to evaluate their models, providing a more comprehensive understanding of how well the models perform across various scales. Lastly, while the paper does not explicitly mention cross-validation or stratified splitting techniques, the use of multiple datasets (E50, E200, E1000) suggests that some form of data partitioning was employed to validate the robustness of the proposed methodology.
