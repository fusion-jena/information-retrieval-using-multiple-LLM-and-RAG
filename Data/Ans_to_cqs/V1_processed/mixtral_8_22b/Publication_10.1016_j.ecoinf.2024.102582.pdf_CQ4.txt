The given context does not provide information about specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, shearing, and brightness adjustment. These techniques help increase the amount of training data by creating modified versions of existing images, thereby improving the model's ability to generalize and prevent overfitting.
