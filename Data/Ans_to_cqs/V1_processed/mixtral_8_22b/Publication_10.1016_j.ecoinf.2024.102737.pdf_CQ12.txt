The pipeline uses a Siamese network, which is a specific type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This network is designed to learn a similarity function, making it suitable for learning with small example sets. Two Siamese architectures were examined, one with 2 convolution layers and another with 4 convolution layers, both utilizing Relu activations and Contrastive Loss (CoL) as a loss function.
