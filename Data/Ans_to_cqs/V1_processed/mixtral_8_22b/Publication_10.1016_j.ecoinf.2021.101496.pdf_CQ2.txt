The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the context that images are used in the process. The text mentions the use of color models such as RGB, HSB, and YUV, which are commonly used in image processing. Additionally, the context discusses the extraction of Digital Numbers (DN) for RGB channels and the calculation of various indices related to these channels. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is primarily image data.
