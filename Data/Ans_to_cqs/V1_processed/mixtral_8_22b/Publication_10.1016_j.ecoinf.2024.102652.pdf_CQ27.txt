Based on the given context, there isn't enough information to provide a detailed explanation about how the trained deep learning model was deployed. However, it can be inferred from the text that the model was trained using a combination of satellite images and ground truth images, which were divided into 70% for training and 30% for testing. Additionally, the model is described as a pixel-based deep learning segmentation architecture, but specific details regarding deployment are missing. Therefore, without further context or information, it is impossible to determine what process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
