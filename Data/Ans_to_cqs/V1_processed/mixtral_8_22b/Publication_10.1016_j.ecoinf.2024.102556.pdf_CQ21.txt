Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training for this particular case. However, generally speaking, some common postprocessing steps include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score, creating confusion matrices, and visualizing results using tools like TensorBoard or Matplotlib. These steps help evaluate the performance of the trained model and provide insights into its strengths and weaknesses. In this case, since the authors plan to optimize their detection model and implement migration learning during training, they might use these techniques to assess the impact of their modifications on the model's performance.
