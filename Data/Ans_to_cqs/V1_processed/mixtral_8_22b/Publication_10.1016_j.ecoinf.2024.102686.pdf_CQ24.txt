The paper does not explicitly discuss strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it mentions using Random Forest (RF) algorithms, which inherently involve some degree of randomness. In RF, multiple decision trees are created, and each tree is trained on a different subset of the training dataset. This process introduces randomness into the model, making it more robust against overfitting. Additionally, the paper uses Out-of-Bag (OOB) error estimation, which further contributes to handling randomness by providing an unbiased estimate of the generalization error. Although these techniques do not directly address the issue of controlling randomness through seed values, they demonstrate ways to leverage randomness to improve model performance and reliability.
