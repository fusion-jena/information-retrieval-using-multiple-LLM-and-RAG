The given context does not provide explicit details about the specific hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the model uses a cross-entropy loss function and involves training a deep neural network, specifically the Inception v3 model. It also refers to a minimization process involving the loss function, suggesting the use of some form of gradient descent optimization algorithm. Unfortunately, without additional information, it is impossible to specify the exact values of these hyperparameters.
