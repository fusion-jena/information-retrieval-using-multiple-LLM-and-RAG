The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it can be inferred that some form of data preparation must have taken place since the text mentions extracting feature vectors from the test datasets and updating them using trained Gaussian parameters to produce refined feature vectors. These processes could involve various preprocessing techniques like normalization, scaling, or cleaning to ensure optimal performance during the training phase. Nevertheless, without more detailed information on the exact methods employed, it would be speculative to state definitively which preprocessing steps were utilized in this particular case.
