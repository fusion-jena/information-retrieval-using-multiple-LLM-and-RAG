The paper does not provide specific information on where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that the CVIP100 dataset was used, which comprises 100 species and a total of 1208 high-quality plant leaf images. However, it does not specify where this dataset can be accessed or downloaded from. Therefore, without additional information, it is not possible to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
