The text does not provide explicit details about specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, scaling, etc., that have been applied in the deep learning pipeline. It primarily focuses on expanding the dataset by incorporating multi-temporal data from different months and environments. Additionally, it mentions the use of transfer learning, specifically the pretrained ResNet-34 architecture, but there is no mention of any particular data augmentation technique being implemented. Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot provide a definitive list of data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
