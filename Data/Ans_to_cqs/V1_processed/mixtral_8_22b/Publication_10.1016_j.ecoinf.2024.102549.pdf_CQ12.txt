The pipeline described in this study utilizes a specific type of deep learning model known as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This can be seen from several references made throughout the text. For instance, Fig. 3 explicitly mentions the use of a CNN model architecture, detailing its various components including convolutional layers, ReLU activation functions, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. Furthermore, the authors mention employing the AlexNet architecture, one of the earliest deep CNNs proposed by Krizhevsky et al. (2012), which was successful in image scene classification tasks. They also discuss how compared to other CNN models, the AlexNet model has a simpler structure and is effective for small-sized inputs, making it easier to train and optimize while still having enough computational power to handle complex problems. Therefore, it is clear that the deep learning model used in this pipeline is a CNN, specifically the AlexNet architecture.
