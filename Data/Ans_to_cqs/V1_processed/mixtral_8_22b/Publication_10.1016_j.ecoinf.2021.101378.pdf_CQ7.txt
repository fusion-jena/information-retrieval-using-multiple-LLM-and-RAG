While the given context does not directly provide information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as train, test, and validation sets, it can be inferred from general practices in machine learning. Typically, the dataset is divided into three subsets: training set, validation set, and testing set. The training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters during the training process. Lastly, the testing set is used to assess the final performance of the trained model. The proportion of each subset varies depending on the size of the dataset and the complexity of the problem being addressed. Common splits include 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing or 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing. However, these proportions may differ based on the requirements and constraints of individual projects.
