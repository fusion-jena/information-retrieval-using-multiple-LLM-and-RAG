The text does not provide explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it can be inferred from the given context that two indicators were used to evaluate the effectiveness of each model in correcting the sampling bias. These indicators could potentially involve metrics calculation, such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), which was mentioned in the table. Additionally, the table also includes delta AUC (Î”AUC) and delta D values, suggesting that these might have been calculated as part of the postprocessing steps for evaluating the models. It is important to note that the use of saliency maps or confusion matrices is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
