The sources provided do not explicitly state the specific data formats used in their respective deep learning pipelines. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that various types of data formats were utilized. For instance, Simonis (2020) conducted a passive acoustic survey, which suggests that audio files might have been employed in their study. Similarly, Soldevilla et al. (2008) focused on classifying dolphins using spectral properties of echolocation clicks, indicating the potential use of audio or spectrogram data. Furthermore, McCullough et al. (2021) performed an acoustic survey, implying the usage of audio data. Lastly, Kirsebom et al. (2022) developed MERIDIAN open-source software for deep learning-based acoustic data analysis, suggesting the application of audio data.

While these studies primarily focus on audio data, other forms such as images, videos, or CSV files may also be relevant depending on the research objectives and methodologies. The citation of Shorten and Khoshgoftaar (2019)'s work on image data augmentation implies that image data could potentially be incorporated into some deep learning pipelines. Additionally, the mention of Team, R. Core (2013)'s R language environment indicates that statistical analyses might involve CSV or similar tabular data formats. Nevertheless, without explicit information regarding each study's specific data format usage, this remains speculative.
