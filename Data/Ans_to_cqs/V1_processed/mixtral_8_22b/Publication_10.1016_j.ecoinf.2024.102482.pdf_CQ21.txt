After the model training, there are several postprocessing steps that can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the task. However, based on the provided context, it does not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, confusion matrices, or metric calculations. Nevertheless, we can infer some potential postprocessing steps based on the information available.

Firstly, since the model is designed for real-time predictions, it would require some form of preprocessing step before making predictions. This could involve normalizing the input data or applying any relevant transformations to ensure that the input data is compatible with the model architecture.

Secondly, once the model has been trained, it can be evaluated using various performance metrics. Based on the context, it appears that the authors use accuracy as their primary evaluation metric. They also mention that they employ different activation functions depending on whether the task involves binary or multi-class classification. Therefore, it can be assumed that they perform some form of metric calculation to evaluate the performance of the model.

Thirdly, while the context does not explicitly mention the creation of confusion matrices, this is often a common postprocessing step when evaluating the performance of machine learning models. A confusion matrix provides a visual representation of the model's performance by comparing predicted labels against actual labels. It allows researchers to identify areas where the model may be performing poorly and adjust accordingly.

Lastly, while the context does not specifically mention the generation of saliency maps, these can be useful for understanding which parts of the input data contribute most to the final prediction. Saliency maps highlight regions within the input data that have the greatest impact on the model's decision-making process. While not explicitly mentioned in the context, generating saliency maps could potentially provide valuable insights into how the model makes its predictions.
