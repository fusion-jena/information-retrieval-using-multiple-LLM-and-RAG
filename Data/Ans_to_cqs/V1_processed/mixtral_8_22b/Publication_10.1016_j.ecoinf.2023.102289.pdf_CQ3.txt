The given context does not provide explicit information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that LaDeco uses the deeplabv3+resnet269 model, which is a semantic segmentation algorithm. Semantic segmentation is a technique used in image recognition that assigns specific objects to each pixel of an image. It involves labeling every pixel with a class or category. Therefore, one could infer that the data annotation technique used in this case might involve pixel-wise labeling or tagging.

Bounding box annotation and instance segmentation are different from semantic segmentation. Bounding box annotation involves drawing a rectangle around an object to identify its location in an image, while instance segmentation involves identifying individual instances of objects and their boundaries. These techniques are often used in object detection tasks rather than semantic segmentation tasks.

In conclusion, without more specific details about the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context, it is difficult to definitively state what data annotation techniques were used. However, given that semantic segmentation was employed, it is likely that some form of pixel-wise labeling or tagging was utilized.
