The performance of the deep learning models in this study is evaluated primarily using two metrics: Accuracy and Macro Average F1-Score.

Accuracy is a common evaluation metric for classification tasks, which measures the proportion of correct predictions out of the total number of instances. For instance, the Inception-V3 model achieved an accuracy of 94%.

Macro Average F1-Score is another important metric used in this study. It is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the F1-scores for each class. The F1-score itself is the harmonic mean of Precision and Recall. A high F1-score indicates good balance between Precision and Recall. The Inception-V3 model also achieved a Macro Average F1-Score of 0.93.

These metrics provide insights into how well the models perform across different classes, especially considering the imbalance in the dataset.
