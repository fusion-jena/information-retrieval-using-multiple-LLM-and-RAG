The text does not provide explicit information on the specific process used to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. However, it mentions that BirdNET is a research project between The Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the Chemnitz University of Technology, and it uses a developed deep neural network to facilitate the automated detection and classification of bird vocalizations from sound recordings. This suggests that the deployment process likely involved collaboration between both institutions and the implementation of the deep neural network into the BirdNET system. Unfortunately, further details about the exact steps taken to deploy the model are not mentioned in the given context.
