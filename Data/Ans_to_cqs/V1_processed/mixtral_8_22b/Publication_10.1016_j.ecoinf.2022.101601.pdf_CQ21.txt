The provided context does not directly mention any specific postprocessing steps involved after model training such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices. However, based on general machine learning practices, some common postprocessing steps include:

1. Evaluation Metrics Calculation: After training a model, it is essential to evaluate its performance using appropriate evaluation metrics. These may vary depending on the type of problem being solved (classification, regression, etc.). Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC, mean squared error, and others.

2. Confusion Matrix: In classification tasks, a confusion matrix is often used to visualize the performance of the model. It provides a summary of prediction results on a classification problem. Each row of the matrix represents the instances in a predicted class while each column represents the instances in an actual class.

3. Saliency Maps: For deep learning models, especially those involving image data, saliency maps can be generated to highlight important features contributing to the output. This helps in understanding which parts of the input data have the most impact on the predictions made by the model.

4. Model Visualization: Techniques like Partial Dependence Plots (PDP), Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots, and SHAP values can help understand how different features affect the outcome. They provide insights into the relationships between input variables and the target variable.

5. Hyperparameter Tuning: Postprocessing might also involve fine-tuning hyperparameters to improve the model's performance further. This could include techniques like grid search, random search, or more advanced methods like Bayesian optimization.
