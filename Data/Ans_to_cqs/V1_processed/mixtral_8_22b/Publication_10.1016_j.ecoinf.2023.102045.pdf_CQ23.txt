The given context does not provide specific details on the development or validation of a deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine what measures were taken to ensure its generalizability based solely on this information. However, common methods used to improve the generalizability of machine learning models include using diverse datasets, employing techniques like cross-validation, stratified sampling, or k-fold validation during training, and evaluating performance metrics across multiple test sets.
