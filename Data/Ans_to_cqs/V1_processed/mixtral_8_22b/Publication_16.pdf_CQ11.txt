Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about the specific data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that the trained model is hosted using TensorFlow 2.2 and served through a public-facing website developed by the authors. However, it does not specify where the original dataset or the deep learning pipeline code is stored. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information based on the given context.
