Based on the given context, it doesn't provide specific information about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, generally speaking, these are common preprocessing steps taken before training any machine learning or deep learning model. Normalization involves rescaling the input features to a standard range, typically between 0 and 1, which helps prevent certain features from dominating others due to their scale. Scaling refers to transforming the feature values to have zero mean and unit variance, which can help stabilize the learning process. Cleaning involves removing noise, outliers, or missing values from the dataset to ensure the quality of the data being fed into the model. These preprocessing steps are crucial to improving the performance and efficiency of the model during training.
