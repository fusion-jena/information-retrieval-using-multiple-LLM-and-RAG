The text does not explicitly mention any criteria for determining when training is complete. However, it mentions that convergence was assessed using the Gelman-Rubin diagnostic. This suggests that the completion of training might be determined based on convergence criteria rather than metrics like validation loss plateaus. Additionally, the text notes that no samples were removed as 'burn-in', indicating that the initial phase of the sampling process was considered part of the converged solution. It also states that no posterior samples were removed via thinning, suggesting that all samples generated during the training process were deemed valuable for understanding the posterior distribution. Therefore, while the exact criteria for determining the completion of training are not specified, they likely involve some form of assessment of convergence or stability in the sampled values.
