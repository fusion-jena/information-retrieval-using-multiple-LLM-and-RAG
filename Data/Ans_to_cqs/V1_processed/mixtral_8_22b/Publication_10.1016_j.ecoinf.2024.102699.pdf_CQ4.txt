The study employs several data augmentation techniques in its deep learning pipeline. In the time domain, these include Gaussian noise, pink noise (background), primary and secondary background noise soundscapes, primary and secondary background noise from the Bird Audio Detection dataset (BAD), background noise such as wind, thunder, or aircraft sounds, mixed-up random bird species, horizontal and vertical rolls, pitch shifts, time masks, frequency masks, gain, loudness normalization, horizontal and vertical flips, time stretches, and tanh-based distortions. In the spectrogram domain, no specific augmentation techniques are mentioned. It should be noted that these techniques are applied with varying probabilities, with single augmentation methods being used at a 50% probability.
