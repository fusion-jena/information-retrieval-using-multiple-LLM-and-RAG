I am sorry, but based on the given information, I cannot provide a direct link to the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used by E. Prasetyo et al. in their study published in Ecological Informatics volume 80 in 2024. The text does not mention any specific links or repositories where the dataset and code are stored. It would be best to check the original publication or contact the authors directly to obtain this information.
