The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided text. However, based on the context, we can infer that the deep learning model is being used for object detection, specifically for detecting trees. This is evident from the mention of "tree detection" and the use of convolutional neural networks, which are commonly used for object detection tasks. Furthermore, the text mentions the use of the retinanet one-stage detector, which is a specific type of object detection algorithm. Therefore, we can conclude that the purpose of the deep learning model is to detect trees in images.
