The given context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references cited in the text, it appears that the authors primarily use image data for their deep learning tasks. For instance, reference number 32 discusses ImageNet classification using deep convolutional neural networks, while reference number 33 focuses on plant identification using images. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of thousands of pictures per class for training deep learning models. Therefore, we can infer that the primary data format used in this study is likely image data.
