The hyperparameters of the model were optimized using a hyperparameter tuning methodology utilizing grid search. Grid search is a technique used to find the optimal values of various hyperparameters by evaluating the model's performance for each grid cell. This approach has been widely used in many studies to optimize the hyperparameters of machine learning models. By employing grid search, the present study aimed to improve the model's performance by finding the most suitable hyperparameters.
