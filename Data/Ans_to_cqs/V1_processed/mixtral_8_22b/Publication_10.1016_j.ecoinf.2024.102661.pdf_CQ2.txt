Based on the given context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily uses structured numerical data, specifically in the form of CSV files. This can be inferred from the mention of input independent variable values (xi), forecasted values (̂yi), actual values (yi), weights of layers in the LSTM neural network (wj), and the L2 regularization parameter (λ). These elements suggest that the data being processed is likely tabular or vectorized data, which is commonly stored in CSV format. However, there is no explicit mention of other data formats such as images, audio, or video. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning pipeline discussed here predominantly utilizes CSV data format.
