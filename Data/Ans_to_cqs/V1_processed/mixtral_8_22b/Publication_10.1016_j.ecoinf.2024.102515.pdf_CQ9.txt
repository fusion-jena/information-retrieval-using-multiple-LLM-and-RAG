The data repository of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, the context does provide a link to a GitHub repository where a training dataset has been made available. The URL provided is <https://github.com/PabloOtero/diversimar_paper>. It can be assumed that this GitHub repository might contain the necessary data for the deep learning pipeline. Please note that this is not a traditional data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF, but rather a code hosting platform. Therefore, if you are looking specifically for a traditional data repository, I regret to inform you that the context does not provide this information.
