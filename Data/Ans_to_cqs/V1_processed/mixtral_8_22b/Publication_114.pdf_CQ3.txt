Based on the given information, it is not explicitly stated what specific data annotation techniques were used in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer that some form of manual labeling was employed since the authors mention that a selection of 1 kmÂ² was manually labeled for training purposes. This could suggest that either bounding box annotation or instance segmentation was utilized, but without further details, it cannot be definitively determined which technique was applied.

It should also be noted that the study primarily focuses on comparing different deep learning architectures such as VGG16, ResNet50, and AlexNet for tree species identification rather than discussing the intricacies of the data annotation process. Therefore, more detailed information regarding the specific data annotation techniques might not be readily available within this particular context.
