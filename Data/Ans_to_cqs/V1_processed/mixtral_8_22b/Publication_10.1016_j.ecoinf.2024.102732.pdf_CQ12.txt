The given context does not provide information about any specific deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers being used in the pipeline. Instead, the context focuses on various regression techniques like Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), XGBoost, and Random Forests (RF) for modeling and prediction purposes. Therefore, there isn't enough information to determine what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline.
