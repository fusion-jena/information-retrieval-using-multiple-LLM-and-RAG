The provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some general approaches can be considered based on common practices in machine learning and deep learning research.

One strategy is to set a fixed random seed value before running experiments to ensure reproducibility. This allows researchers to compare results across different runs more accurately. Another approach is to use multiple random seeds and report average performance metrics, which helps mitigate the impact of any single random initialization.

Additionally, techniques like cross-validation, bootstrapping, and ensemble methods can help manage variability due to randomness in model training. Cross-validation involves splitting the dataset into several folds and training models on different subsets to evaluate their performance. Bootstrapping generates multiple datasets by sampling with replacement from the original dataset, allowing for robust estimation of model performance. Ensemble methods combine predictions from multiple models trained with different initializations or architectures to improve overall accuracy and stability.

In summary, although the provided context does not specifically address handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, common strategies include setting fixed random seeds, averaging over multiple runs, employing cross-validation, bootstrapping, and utilizing ensemble methods.
