The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves evaluating the model's accuracy using several parameters such as the coefficient of determination (R^2), root-mean-square error (RMSE), ratio of performance to deviation (RPD), and ratio of performance to interquartile range (RPIQ). These metrics allow researchers to determine how well their models perform and whether they need further adjustments or improvements.

In this case, the Support Vector Machine Regression (SVMR) model was trained using the libsvm package in MATLAB. Parameter values were chosen based on the Root Mean Square Error Cross Validation (RMSEcv) values. During the training process, the epsilon-SVR model and Gaussian Radial Basis Function (RBF) were employed to build the calibration model. Optimal parameters like cost C, epsilon p, and gamma g were utilized to ensure the highest possible accuracy without overfitting the SVMR model.

To summarize, the strategy to monitor the model performance during training includes selecting appropriate evaluation metrics, choosing suitable algorithms and packages for training, setting optimal parameter values, and avoiding overfitting. This approach enables researchers to create reliable and robust predictive models.
