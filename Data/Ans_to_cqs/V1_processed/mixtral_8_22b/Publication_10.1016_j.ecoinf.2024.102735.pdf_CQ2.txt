The information provided does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on Table 4, it can be inferred that the data is likely in a structured format, possibly a CSV file or similar, since it includes columns for various measurements like temperature, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, saturated DO, ORP, specific conductivity, pH, and chlorophyll-a levels. The data appears to consist of numerical values rather than images, audio, or video files. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is most likely a structured format such as CSV.
