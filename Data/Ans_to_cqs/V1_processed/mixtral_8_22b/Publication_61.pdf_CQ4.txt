The paper discusses two variations of data augmentation techniques used in their deep learning pipeline. These include:

1. No augmentation: This involves resizing the patches to 32 x 32 pixels and normalizing them without any additional transformations.

2. Vertical and horizontal flip: Alongside resizing and normalization, the patches are flipped either vertically or horizontally with a probability of 0.5. Both flipping operations are independent events.

These data augmentation techniques help improve the accuracy of the deep learning model by providing more diverse input data during training.
