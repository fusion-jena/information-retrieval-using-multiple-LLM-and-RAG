The text does not explicitly mention any specific dataset used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN) for investigating the scalability and transferability of ensemble techniques. CNNs and RCNNs are commonly used for image classification tasks, so it can be assumed that some form of image dataset was likely used in this study. Unfortunately, without further information or context, it cannot be determined which specific dataset was used.
