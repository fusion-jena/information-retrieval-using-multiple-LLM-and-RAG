The paper uses positive predicted value (PPV) and negative predicted value (NPV) to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. PPV is a measure of how many true positives there are out of all positive predictions made by the model, while NPV measures how many true negatives there are out of all negative predictions made by the model. These metrics are presented in Table 4 for both two- and three-state hidden Markov models. The results show that under both cross-validation methods, the strongest models had high values for both PPV and NPV.
