Before implementing deep learning models for the classification task, several preprocessing steps were taken. First, all images were resized to the same resolution (227x197 pixels) by considering the mean dimensions of the set. This step ensures that all input data has consistent dimensions, which is crucial for most deep learning models. Next, the images were normalized to the [0,1] range. Normalization scales pixel intensity values to a small, specified range to improve the speed and stability of the network during training. It helps prevent any single feature from dominating the others if they are not scaled to comparable ranges, ensuring better convergence of the model. No explicit mention of additional preprocessing steps such as cleaning or augmentation was made in the given context.
