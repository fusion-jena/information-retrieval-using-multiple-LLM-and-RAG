The text does not provide specific information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that the study uses a dataset consisting of 2D LiDAR images for forest classification, but it does not specify where this dataset can be accessed or downloaded. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
