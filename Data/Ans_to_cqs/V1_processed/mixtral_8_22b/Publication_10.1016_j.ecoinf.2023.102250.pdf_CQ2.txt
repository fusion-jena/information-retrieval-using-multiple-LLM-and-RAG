Based on the given context, it appears that the study primarily focuses on image data for deep learning applications. Specifically, the research involves generating synthetic bird images from spectrograms and utilizing them for training various CNN models such as ResNet18, VGG16, and MobileNetV2. Therefore, the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is image data. However, it should be noted that the initial source of the data comes from audio recordings of birdsongs, which are converted into spectrograms before being processed further. Thus, although not directly mentioned, audio data also plays a role in the overall pipeline. There is no mention of other data formats like CSV or video in the provided context.
