The given context does not provide explicit information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed, such as a validation loss plateau. However, based on the context, we can infer that the authors use multiple runs of their models to account for any variability introduced by random factors like weight initialization or random sampling during training. This implies that they might have used some form of early stopping or convergence criterion to ensure that the models do not overfit or underfit the data. Additionally, since the context mentions the F1-score as a measure of model performance, it could be assumed that this metric was also considered while determining the completion of training. Nonetheless, without further details from the original source, one cannot definitively state the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete.
