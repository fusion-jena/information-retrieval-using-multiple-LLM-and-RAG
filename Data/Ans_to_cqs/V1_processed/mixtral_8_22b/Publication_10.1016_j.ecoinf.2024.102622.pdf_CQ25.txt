The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred that the model is likely being used for classification purposes. This is because the authors mention using various machine learning methods, including random forest classification, support vector machine classification, and decision tree classification, to extract crop-growing areas. They also state that they selected the random forest classification method to extract the rice-growing area of Qian Gorlos County with a classification accuracy of over 90%. Additionally, they discuss selecting the model with the highest accuracy to estimate the rice leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) and crop coverage degree in the entire study area. Based on these details, it can be concluded that the deep learning model is most likely being used for classification tasks related to crop identification and analysis.
