To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the study utilized a diverse dataset consisting of various variables related to tree growth in the Atlantic Forest. This diversity in the dataset helped prevent overfitting and improved the model's ability to perform well on unseen data. Secondly, the study employed cross-validation techniques during the training process. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into multiple subsets or folds, where one fold is used for testing while the remaining folds are used for training. This process is repeated until every fold has been used for testing once. Cross-validation helps assess how well the model will perform on new, unseen data and reduces the risk of overfitting. Lastly, stratified splitting was likely applied when partitioning the dataset into training and testing sets. Stratified splitting ensures that both sets maintain the same distribution of target variable values, which can help improve the model's predictive accuracy and reduce bias. These measures collectively contributed to ensuring the generalizability of the deep learning model and its applicability in real-world scenarios.
