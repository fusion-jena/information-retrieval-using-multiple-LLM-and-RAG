The study uses the Inception v.3 model for its deep learning tasks. The authors configured the model parameters by training the last two fully connected network layers in their dataset using a learning rate of 0.001 and a decay factor of 16 every 30 epochs. They employed RMSProp as the optimization algorithm, setting the momentum to 0.9 and epsilon to 0.1.
