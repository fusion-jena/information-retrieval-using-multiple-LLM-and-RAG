The paper does not explicitly mention any specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses using Recursive Feature Elimination and Cross-Validation (RFECV) for selecting optimal features to reduce redundancy caused by multi-source feature datasets and improve model performance. This method can be considered a form of regularization since it helps avoid overfitting by reducing the complexity of the model. Furthermore, the use of a five-fold cross-validation during the RFECV process also contributes to preventing overfitting.
