The papers mentioned do not directly discuss specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, some general principles regarding model complexity and overfitting can still be gleaned from them.

In the paper by Marrs and Ni-Meister (2019), they use machine learning techniques for tree species classification using co-registered LiDAR and hyperspectral data. While they do not explicitly mention regularization methods, their approach involves selecting relevant features and reducing dimensionality, which can help prevent overfitting. Similarly, Qin et al. (2022) employ machine learning algorithms for individual tree segmentation and tree species classification using UAV-based LiDAR, hyperspectral, and ultrahigh-resolution RGB data. They also focus on feature selection and dimensionality reduction but do not specifically address regularization methods.

Although not directly related to deep learning pipelines, the paper by Lu (2007) discusses the potential and challenges of remote sensing-based biomass estimation. One of the challenges mentioned is dealing with complex models and avoiding overfitting. This suggests that regularization methods could play a role in improving the accuracy of biomass estimations.

In summary, while the provided papers do not explicitly discuss regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization, they emphasize the importance of managing model complexity and preventing overfitting. Regularization methods can contribute to achieving these goals in deep learning pipelines.
