Based on the given context, there is no direct information about specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it can be inferred from general practices in machine learning and deep learning that techniques like setting fixed seeds or using deterministic algorithms could be used to manage randomness. These methods help ensure reproducibility and consistency across different runs of the same model. Additionally, cross-validation techniques, ensemble methods, and hyperparameter tuning can also contribute to handling randomness and improving overall model performance.
