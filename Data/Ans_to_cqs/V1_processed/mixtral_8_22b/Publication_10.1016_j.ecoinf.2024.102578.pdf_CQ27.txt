Based on the given information, it appears that the article discusses a multi-step, semi-automated workflow adapted from BÃ¶hner et al., 2023, which includes image pre-processing, model training, classification, manual quality checks, and final data formatting. However, there is no explicit mention of the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, based solely on this excerpt, it cannot be determined what process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
