The authors applied several data augmentation techniques to their deep learning pipeline to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization capabilities. These techniques include random cropping, horizontal and vertical flipping, image rotation, image translation, zooming, brightness adjustment, contrast adjustment, hue and saturation adjustment, gaussian noise, and random erasing. All these methods helped increase the size and variability of the dataset, allowing the model to learn better representations and improving its performance on unseen data.
