The paper does not provide specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the authors use transfer learning and active learning to reduce the amount of time required for annotating Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) datasets. Transfer learning involves using pre-trained models to extract features from new datasets, while active learning involves selecting the most informative samples for manual annotation. The authors do not mention any specific annotation techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Instead, they focus on evaluating the performance of various embedding models pre-trained on large datasets from different domains, including images, generic audio, and bioacoustics. They then apply these models to three soundscape datasets covering different taxa and compare their performance using linear classifiers. Based on the results, they identify the best feature space for sound event detection with soundscape data and explore the potential of active learning to accelerate learning in this space. Overall, the paper emphasizes the importance of leveraging existing knowledge through transfer learning and reducing the need for extensive manual annotation through active learning.
