The given context does not provide information about the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, shearing, and adding noise. These techniques help increase the amount of training data available and improve model performance by introducing variations into the dataset.

Based on the context, it can be inferred that the study may have involved spatial data processing and analysis using tools such as ArcGIS and R software. The authors also mentioned using MODIS data and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data, which suggests that they might have employed remote sensing techniques for their research. However, without explicit mention of the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, we cannot definitively state what methods were utilized.
