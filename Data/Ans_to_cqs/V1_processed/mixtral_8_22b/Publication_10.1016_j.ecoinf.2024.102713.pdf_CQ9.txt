Unfortunately, based on the given information, it does not explicitly state where the data repository for the deep learning pipeline is available. However, there is a mention of links to download data and code being found within the paper. Therefore, I would recommend checking the original research paper or contacting the authors directly for more specific information regarding the location of the data repository.
