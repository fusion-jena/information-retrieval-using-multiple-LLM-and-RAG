The given context does not provide information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, some common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest within images or videos. Semantic segmentation involves labeling every pixel in an image with its corresponding class or category. Instance segmentation combines both object detection and semantic segmentation by identifying individual instances of objects within an image while also providing detailed outlines of those objects. Other annotation techniques may include landmark annotation, polygon annotation, and key point annotation. These techniques can be applied manually or through automated tools such as machine learning algorithms.
