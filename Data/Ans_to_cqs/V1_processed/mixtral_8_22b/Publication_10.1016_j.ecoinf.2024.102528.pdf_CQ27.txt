The text does not provide explicit information about the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, including details like model serialization or platform selection. However, it mentions that the BirdNET-Analyzer deep learning model was utilized within an automated framework for continuous bioacoustic monitoring of bird species. This suggests that the deployment process likely involved integrating the pre-trained BirdNET-Analyzer model into the customized framework designed for analyzing bird vocalizations.

To clarify the exact steps taken during the deployment process, additional resources or documentation related to the research would be required. Nonetheless, based on common practices in machine learning projects, one could speculate that the deployment might have included exporting the trained model weights, loading them onto the chosen platform, and then integrating the model with other components of the framework, such as data processing pipelines and visualization tools.
