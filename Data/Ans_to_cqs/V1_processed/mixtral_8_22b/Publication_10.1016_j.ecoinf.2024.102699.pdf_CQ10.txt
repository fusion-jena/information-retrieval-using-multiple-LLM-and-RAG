Unfortunately, there isn't enough context provided to determine the exact code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the given information, I can suggest looking into popular repositories containing implementations of Vision Transformers (ViT) and other deep learning models mentioned in the text, such as DenseNet-161 and ResNet-50. Some possible starting points could include:

1. Official TensorFlow implementation of Vision Transformer (ViT): <https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/vision/transformer>
2. Hugging Face's Transformers library, which includes several pretrained ViT models: <https://github.com/huggingface/transformers>
3. TorchVision's official implementation of DenseNet-161: <https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/models.html#densenet>
4. PyTorch's official implementation of ResNet-50: <https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/models.html#resnet>
