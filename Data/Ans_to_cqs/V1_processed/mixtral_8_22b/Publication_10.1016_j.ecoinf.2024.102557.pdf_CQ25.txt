The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, based on the applications mentioned such as studying species distribution, characterizing land use changes, identifying conservable or restorable areas, and assessing risks from invasive species, it can be inferred that the deep learning models could serve various purposes including but not limited to classification, regression, and object detection tasks. Classification tasks might involve categorizing images into different classes like species types or land cover categories. Regression tasks could include estimating continuous variables such as population density or habitat suitability indices. Object detection tasks may involve locating specific objects within images, such as individual animals or invasive plant species. It should be noted that without additional information about the specific models discussed in the sources, this remains an educated guess rather than a definitive statement.
