The given context does not provide information on the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on common practices in machine learning and artificial intelligence, various types of data can be utilized in such pipelines, including images, audio files, videos, text files, and structured datasets like CSV or Excel files. Without further details about the specific application or research mentioned in the context, it is impossible to determine which data format was employed.

Based on the context, we can see that the authors have conducted studies related to ecological informatics, using methods such as random forest models, occupancy-detection models, and spatial interpolation techniques. These methods could potentially involve different data formats depending on their implementation. For instance, they might use satellite imagery, climate data, or other forms of environmental data stored in various file formats. Nonetheless, without explicit mention of the data formats used in these studies, one cannot definitively state what type of data was processed through the deep learning pipeline.
