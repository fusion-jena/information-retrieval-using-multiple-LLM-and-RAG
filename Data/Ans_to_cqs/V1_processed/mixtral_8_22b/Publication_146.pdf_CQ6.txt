The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model. However, it can be assumed that common preprocessing techniques such as image resizing, normalization, or data augmentation might have been applied, considering the nature of the task being object detection from aerial images.

Image resizing could have been used to ensure all input images were of uniform dimensions, making them compatible with the input layer of the deep learning model. Normalization may have been performed to scale pixel intensities to a standard range, typically between 0 and 1, allowing the model to converge more quickly during training. Data augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, zooming, or cropping could also have been employed to increase the diversity of the dataset and improve the model's ability to generalize.

While the context does not provide explicit details about the preprocessing steps, these assumptions are based on typical practices when working with image datasets for deep learning tasks.
