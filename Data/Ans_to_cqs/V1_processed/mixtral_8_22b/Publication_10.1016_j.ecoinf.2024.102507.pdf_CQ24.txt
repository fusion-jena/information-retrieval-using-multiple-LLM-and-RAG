Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it does discuss some techniques used to enhance the dataset for deep learning purposes. To address the lack of sufficient samples for smaller forest types, they created overlapping image units by moving a distance of 128 pixels in both x and y directions while generating the next image unit. This resulted in a 50% overlap rate between consecutive images. Additionally, they generated new image units by rotating each unit every 45 degrees, thereby obtaining the same set of training samples from various angles to enrich the data. These methods help improve the robustness and generalization capabilities of the model, but do not directly tackle the issue of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
