To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting is a technique where the dataset is divided into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes or labels in both sets. This ensures that the model learns from a representative sample of the entire dataset, reducing any potential bias towards certain classes.

Oversampling is another method used to balance class distributions by duplicating examples from the minority class until it has the same number of instances as the majority class. This helps prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class due to its larger representation in the dataset.

Undersampling, on the other hand, involves removing examples from the majority class to achieve equal representation between classes. While this may result in losing some information, it can help reduce overfitting and improve overall performance if the dataset is highly imbalanced.

Lastly, collecting diverse data is crucial for mitigating data bias. By gathering samples from various sources and ensuring they cover different aspects of the problem domain, we can create a more comprehensive and unbiased dataset. This allows our models to generalize better and perform well across different scenarios.

In summary, addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline requires careful consideration of techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Each method serves a unique purpose in balancing class distributions and improving model performance.
