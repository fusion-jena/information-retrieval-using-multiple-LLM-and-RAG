The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is segmentation. Specifically, the authors implemented a U-Net architecture, which is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed for biomedical image segmentation. The goal of the U-Net architecture is to perform pixel-level semantic segmentation, where each pixel in an image is classified into a specific category. In this case, the U-Net architecture was used to segment high-resolution orthophotos obtained from an aerial survey. The U-Net architecture consists of two main paths: an encoding path and a decoding path. The encoding path is responsible for capturing the contextual information in the images, while the decoding path is responsible for precise localization of objects within the images. Together, these paths enable the U-Net architecture to accurately segment objects within complex scenes.
