The text does not provide explicit information on the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as train, test, and validation sets. However, common practices include splitting the dataset randomly or based on time series order. A typical ratio for splitting datasets is 80/20 or 70/30 for training and testing respectively, with some portion reserved for validation. Cross-validation methods like k-fold cross-validation can also be employed to evaluate the performance of the model.
