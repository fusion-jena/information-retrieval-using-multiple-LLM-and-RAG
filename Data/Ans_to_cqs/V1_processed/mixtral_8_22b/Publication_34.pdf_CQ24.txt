The text does not provide explicit information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on common practices in machine learning, one strategy could be using fixed random seeds during training to ensure reproducibility of results. Another approach might involve running multiple trials with different random seeds and averaging the results to mitigate the effects of random initialization. Unfortunately, without specific details from the given context, these suggestions remain speculative.
