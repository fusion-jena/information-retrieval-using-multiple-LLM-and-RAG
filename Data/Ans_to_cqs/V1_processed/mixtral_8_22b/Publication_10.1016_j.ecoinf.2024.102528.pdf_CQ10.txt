The authors do not provide a direct link to the code repository of the deep learning pipeline in the given context. However, they mention that the framework relies on the BirdNET-Analyzer deep learning model. To find the relevant code repository, one could search online for "BirdNET-Analyzer" or visit the official website mentioned in the text, <https://birdnet.cornell.edu/>. Unfortunately, without additional information, it is impossible to determine the exact code repository link for the specific implementation used in this research.
