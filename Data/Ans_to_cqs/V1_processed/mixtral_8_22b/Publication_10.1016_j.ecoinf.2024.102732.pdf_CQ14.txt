The hyperparameters of the Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models are optimized using a grid search methodology. Grid search is a technique used to identify the optimal values for hyperparameters by exhaustively searching over a manually specified subset of a hyperparameter space of a learning algorithm. In this process, all possible combinations of hyperparameters are tried out, and the one that gives the highest score is picked.

For RF, the key parameters for tuning include "ntree," which controls the number of trees, and "mtry," which determines the number of variables sampled at each split. These parameters are optimized using grid search. Variable importance is then assessed using "percent IncMSE" and "IncNodePurity" indices.

On the other hand, important indices to measure variable importance in XGBoost include "Gain" and "Frequency." The key parameters for tuning XGBoost include "nrounds" (boosting iterations), "max depth," "min child weight," "gamma," and "subsample." Again, a grid search methodology is employed to find the best parameter combination, enhancing the modelâ€™s performance.

Support Vector Regression (SVR) tuning involves selecting the appropriate kernel function and optimizing the "C" parameter, which balances margin width and misclassification tolerance. The versatility of SVR allows it to handle complex decision boundaries effectively.
