The text does not provide explicit details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of Earth Observation (EO) datasets multiple times. This suggests that remote sensing techniques, which involve the use of satellite or airborne sensors, might be employed to gather data. Additionally, the mention of 'contextual datasets' implies that supplementary data sources, possibly including publicly available datasets, may also contribute to the data collection process. Nonetheless, without further clarification, it cannot be definitively stated what specific methods or tools are used for data collection.
