The given context does not provide specific details about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. However, it discusses the use of Vision Transformers (ViT) in computer vision tasks. ViT is a type of deep neural network that uses a self-attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies in input data. Unlike traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), ViT models can attend to different parts of the input simultaneously, making them well-suited for tasks involving large amounts of data.

In the context of sika deer identification, the authors propose a hybrid approach that combines a ViT model with a CNN backbone (such as ResNet) to improve computational efficiency while maintaining good performance. This approach allows the ViT model to focus on modeling global attention using features extracted by the CNN backbone. While the context does not explicitly mention any data augmentation techniques, it is common practice in deep learning pipelines to apply various forms of data augmentation to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset. Some popular data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, and color jittering. These techniques help prevent overfitting and improve the generalizability of the trained model.
