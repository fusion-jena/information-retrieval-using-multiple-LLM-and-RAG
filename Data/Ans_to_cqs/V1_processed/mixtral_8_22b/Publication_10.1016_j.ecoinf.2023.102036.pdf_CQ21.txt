The given context does not provide explicit details regarding any specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, based on common practices in machine learning projects, some potential postprocessing steps could include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics such as accuracy or precision, creating confusion matrices, or performing other forms of analysis to evaluate the model's performance. It should be noted that these possibilities are speculative and not directly supported by the provided context.
