In the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer. However, we can infer some hyperparameters based on the information provided.

The text mentions building a three-layer backpropagation (BP) artificial neural network using MATLAB R2014b. The number of layers and their respective functions (input, hidden, and output) can be considered as hyperparameters. In this case, the input layer corresponds to aCDOM(254) and Fn(355), while both the intermediate (hidden) and output layers consist of a single neuron corresponding to the predictor TSI.

Additionally, two other hyperparameters mentioned are the maximum training times set to 10,000 and the training error threshold set to 0.001. These values determine when the training process should stop, either after reaching the specified number of iterations or achieving the desired level of accuracy.

However, without further details about the implementation, it is not possible to provide more specific hyperparameter values like learning rate or optimizer type.
