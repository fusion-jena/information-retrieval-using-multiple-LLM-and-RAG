The text does not provide explicit information about the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN). However, popular frameworks for building these types of models include TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch. Without further context, it cannot be determined which framework was utilized in this case.
