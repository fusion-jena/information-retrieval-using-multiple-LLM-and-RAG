The context does not provide specific details on the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, generally, the dataset is divided into three subsets: training set, validation set, and testing set. The training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Lastly, the testing set is used to evaluate the final performance of the trained model. Common methods for splitting datasets include random sampling, stratified sampling, and time series split. Random sampling involves randomly selecting instances from the original dataset, whereas stratified sampling ensures that each subset has a similar distribution of classes. Time series split is often used when dealing with sequential data, where the order matters. It divides the dataset chronologically, ensuring no future data leaks into past data during training.
