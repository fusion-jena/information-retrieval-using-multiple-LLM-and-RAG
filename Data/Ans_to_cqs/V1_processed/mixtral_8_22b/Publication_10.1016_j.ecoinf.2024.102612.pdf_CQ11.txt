Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no information about the specific data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that the best classification performance of the SoftGroup semantic branch was achieved by the Multispectral (MS) input data case, but it does not provide any details regarding the storage or sharing of the dataset or the deep learning pipeline itself. Therefore, without additional context, it is impossible to determine the exact data repository link of the deep learning pipeline.
