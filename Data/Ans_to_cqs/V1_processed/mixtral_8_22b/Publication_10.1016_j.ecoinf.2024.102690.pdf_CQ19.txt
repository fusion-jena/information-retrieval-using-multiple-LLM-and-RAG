Based on the given information, it appears that the Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM) is being used as part of the methodology for analyzing ecological data. However, there is no explicit mention of any specific deep learning framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch being utilized in building the model. Therefore, I cannot definitively state which framework is being employed in this case.
