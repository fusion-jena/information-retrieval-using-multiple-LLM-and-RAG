After the model training, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the task. Based on the given context, it appears that the authors have calculated two metrics to evaluate the performance of their neural network model: the coefficient of determination (R^2) and the root-mean-square error (RMSE). These metrics help quantify how well the predicted values match the actual measurements.

The coefficient of determination (R^2) measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variables. It ranges from 0 to 1, where a value closer to 1 indicates better fit. On the other hand, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) calculates the average difference between the predicted and observed values. A lower RMSE value signifies a more accurate prediction.

In addition to these metrics, visualization techniques such as saliency maps or confusion matrices may also be employed based on the problem statement. However, since the context does not mention any use of these methods, we cannot confirm if they were applied in this particular case.
