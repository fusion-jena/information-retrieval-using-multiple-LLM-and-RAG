The given context does not provide specific information about the method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the training dataset and testing dataset were used for both the customized architecture and the transfer learning approach. It also states that the smallest dataset comprised 3900 images with a two-second window size and 90 dpi resolution. This suggests that the raw data collected could have been image data, possibly from sensors or cameras. Unfortunately, without more explicit details regarding the data collection process, we cannot definitively determine the exact method used for gathering the raw data.
