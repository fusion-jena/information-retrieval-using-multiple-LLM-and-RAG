The given context does not provide specific details about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline mentioned by Sousa et al. (2020) for wildfire detection. Generally, data augmentation techniques can include various methods such as flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, zooming, shearing, and others. These techniques help improve the diversity of the training set and prevent overfitting by creating modified versions of existing images or data points. However, without further information, it cannot be determined which specific data augmentation techniques were utilized in the referenced study.
