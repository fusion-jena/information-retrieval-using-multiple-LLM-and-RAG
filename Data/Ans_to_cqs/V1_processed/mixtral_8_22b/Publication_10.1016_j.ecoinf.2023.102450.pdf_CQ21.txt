The postprocessing steps involved after the model training include generating saliency maps for visualizing the important features used by the model for decision making, calculating metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy to evaluate the performance of the model, and creating confusion matrices to understand the misclassifications made by the model. Additionally, some models may require further processing such as thresholding or normalization before being deployed for real-world applications.

Based on the given context, it is not explicitly mentioned what specific postprocessing steps are taken after the model training. However, based on general machine learning practices, the possible postprocessing steps could be generating saliency maps, calculating evaluation metrics, and creating confusion matrices.

Saliency maps can help visualize which parts of the input data are most influential for the model's predictions. This can provide insights into how the model makes decisions and identify any potential biases or errors in its reasoning process.

Calculation of evaluation metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy can give a quantitative measure of the model's performance. These metrics can help compare different models and select the best performing one.

Confusion matrices can also provide valuable information about the model's performance. They show the number of correct and incorrect classifications made by the model, broken down by each class label. This can highlight any classes that the model struggles with and guide future improvements.

In summary, while the exact postprocessing steps are not specified in the given context, common practices in machine learning suggest that generating saliency maps, calculating evaluation metrics, and creating confusion matrices are likely candidates for postprocessing steps after model training.
