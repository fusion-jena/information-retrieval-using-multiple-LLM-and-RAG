Based on the given context, it appears that the authors used satellite data for their research. However, there isn't any specific information about how they collected or obtained these satellite data. Generally speaking, satellite data can be acquired through various means such as direct downloads from government agencies like NASA or commercial providers, APIs, web scraping, or even purchasing them directly from vendors. These data may include images, measurements, or other types of information gathered by satellites orbiting Earth. In the case of this study, it seems likely that the researchers used some form of remote sensing data related to oceanography, possibly including sea surface temperature, salinity, or chlorophyll concentration, among others. Unfortunately, without more detailed information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer regarding the exact methodology employed for gathering the raw data used in this particular deep learning pipeline.
