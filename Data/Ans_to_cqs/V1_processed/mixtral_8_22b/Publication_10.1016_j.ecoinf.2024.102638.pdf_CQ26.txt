To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. In the given context, one technique mentioned is random sampling to divide the dataset into training and testing sets. This method ensures that both subsets are representative of the overall dataset and minimises the risk of bias. By preserving the distribution of key features and target variables across both training and test sets, it enhances the generalisability of the model.

Stratified splitting is another technique that could have been used but was not explicitly mentioned in the context. It involves dividing the dataset such that the proportions of classes or categories remain consistent between the training and testing sets. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets.

Oversampling and undersampling are also common methods to handle class imbalance. Oversampling increases the frequency of minority classes, while undersampling reduces the frequency of majority classes. These techniques help to balance the dataset and prevent models from being biased towards the majority class. However, they were not specifically mentioned in the context.

Lastly, diverse data collection is a proactive approach to addressing data bias. Collecting data from various sources and ensuring diversity in the dataset can help mitigate potential biases. While not directly related to preprocessing, it plays a crucial role in building unbiased machine learning models.

In conclusion, based on the provided context, random sampling is used to minimise data bias during preprocessing. Other techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, though not explicitly mentioned, are also relevant approaches to handling data bias.
