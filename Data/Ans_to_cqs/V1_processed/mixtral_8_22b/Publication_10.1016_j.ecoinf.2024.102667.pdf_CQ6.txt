Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be taken to improve its performance. These may include data cleaning, where missing or inconsistent data is removed or corrected. Normalization and scaling techniques such as min-max scaling or z-score normalization can also be applied to ensure all input features have similar scales, which helps prevent any single feature from dominating the others during training. Additionally, data augmentation methods like rotation, flipping, or cropping can be used to increase the size of the dataset and reduce overfitting. Lastly, encoding categorical variables into numerical representations using one-hot encoding or label encoding might be necessary depending on the specific problem and architecture being used.
