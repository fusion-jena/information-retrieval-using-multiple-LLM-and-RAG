The given context does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. It primarily discusses the use of a convolutional neural network for analyzing landscape photographs and the calculation of various metrics related to 3D spatial analysis. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information based on the available context.
