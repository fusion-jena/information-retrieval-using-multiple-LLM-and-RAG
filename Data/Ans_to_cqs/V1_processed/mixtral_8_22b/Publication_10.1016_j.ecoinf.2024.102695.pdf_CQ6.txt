The given text does not provide explicit information about any preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that some form of data division was performed based on the mention of dividing the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets. This division is often done after preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning have been applied to ensure that the model learns effectively from the data. Unfortunately, without more detailed information, we cannot definitively state what specific preprocessing steps were carried out in this case.
