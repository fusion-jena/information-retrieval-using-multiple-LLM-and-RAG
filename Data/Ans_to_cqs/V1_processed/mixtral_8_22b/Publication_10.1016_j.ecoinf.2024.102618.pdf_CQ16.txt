Based on the provided context, the exact criteria for determining when training is complete are not explicitly mentioned. However, some common criteria used to determine when training is complete include reaching a certain number of epochs or iterations, achieving a desired level of performance on a validation set, observing a plateau in the validation loss, or meeting early stopping conditions based on changes in validation loss over multiple epochs. In this case, the authors mention that they observe fast convergence in the model's response, specifically noting that the EfficientNetB3 model converged at the fourth epoch. Therefore, one possible interpretation could be that the authors determined training was complete once the model had reached a satisfactory level of performance within a reasonable number of epochs.
