The text does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, it mentions that 500 survey images were selected randomly to be used exclusively for training. It also discusses the use of transfer learning and adjustments made to the loss function during training. Unfortunately, without further details, it is impossible to determine the exact criteria used for splitting the data.
