Based on the given context, there is no explicit information about how the data was split for training, testing, and validation purposes in the deep learning model. However, it is common practice in machine learning to divide the dataset into these subsets. Typically, the dataset is divided into three parts: training set, validation set, and test set. The training set is used to fit the model, the validation set is used to tune the model's hyperparameters, and the test set is used to evaluate the final model's performance. The proportion of the division can vary depending on the size of the dataset and the specific requirements of the project. A commonly used ratio is 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing.
