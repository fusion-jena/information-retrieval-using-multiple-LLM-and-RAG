Based on the given context, there isn't any direct mention of specific data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotation, scaling, etc., typically associated with image processing tasks in deep learning pipelines. However, the text does discuss some general strategies employed to address sampling bias in Species Distribution Models (SDMs), which could be seen as analogous to data augmentation techniques in other domains.

In this case, the authors describe four different approaches to modify the input data to reduce sampling bias. These approaches can be classified based on whether they focus on presence sites or background sites, and if their implementation occurs in geographical or environmental spaces.

For instance, when considering the presence dataset, the goal is to alter its distribution towards a uniform distribution. This can be done in either geographical or environmental feature spaces. In contrast, when focusing on the background set, it is constructed based on a selection bias reflecting the same sampling bias.

While these techniques do not directly correspond to traditional data augmentation methods like flipping, rotating, or scaling images, they serve a similar purpose â€“ improving the quality and representativeness of the training data.
