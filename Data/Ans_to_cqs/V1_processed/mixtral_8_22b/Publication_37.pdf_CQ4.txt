The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline for classifying migrating birds' flight calls include adding background noise, dynamic range compression, pitch shifting, and time stretching. These techniques aim to increase the size of the training set and improve the performance of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.

Adding background noise involves incorporating four different field recordings captured at night containing geophony. This helps the model generalize better when dealing with real-world scenarios where various types of background noise may be present.

Dynamic range compression is applied using four parameterizations: music, film, speech, and radio. This technique reduces the volume difference between quiet and loud sounds, making it easier for the model to identify relevant features across varying volumes.

Pitch shifting modifies the frequency content of the audio signals by applying conservative (-0.5, -0.25, 0.25, 0.5 semitones) and less conservative (-2, -1, 1, 2 semitones) shifts. This allows the model to learn more robust features that can handle variations in pitch caused by factors such as individual differences or environmental conditions.

Time stretching alters the duration of the audio signals by applying four ratios: 0.81, 0.93, 1.07, and 1.23. By changing the speed of the audio signals, the model becomes more adept at recognizing patterns regardless of their temporal characteristics.

These augmentations are implemented using the MUDA library, which provides further details regarding the specifics of each audio deformation. Overall, these data augmentation techniques help enhance the performance of the CNN model in accurately classifying migrating birds' flight calls.
