Based on the provided context, there is no mention of a deep learning model being used in the study. Instead, the authors describe using a combination of least squares (LS) estimation and a genetic algorithm for optimization purposes. They also utilize Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling techniques. Therefore, it would not be accurate to discuss the purpose of a deep learning model in this scenario.
