Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific postprocessing steps taken after the model training. However, it can be inferred that some common practices might have been followed such as calculating evaluation metrics like Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) to assess the quality of reconstructed images. These metrics help quantify the similarities and differences between the reconstructed images and their respective ground truth images. Additionally, visual inspection of the reconstructed images could also serve as a qualitative assessment method.

It should be noted that this interpretation is based solely on the provided context and does not account for any additional postprocessing steps that may have been carried out but not mentioned explicitly. Therefore, without further details regarding the exact postprocessing procedures employed, it would be speculative to provide a more comprehensive list of potential postprocessing steps.
