Based on the provided context, there isn't any explicit mention of how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, such as through methods like grid search or random search. Instead, the focus seems to be on setting prior probabilities and incorporating prior knowledge into the model.

In the context, it's mentioned that each model's prior probability is set to 0.2 to give equal chances a priori. Additionally, the text discusses the use of independent normally distributed prior distributions on the model parameters, which can either be informative or noninformative. The exponential of each beta parameter is used to represent the increase in the odds of having a wildfire for each unit increase in the predictor. Prior information about these odds is incorporated into the model via the mean of a normal prior distribution, while the degree of belief in the prior information is expressed using the variance of the normal prior distribution.

Furthermore, Algorithm 1 is presented to quantify the magnitude and direction of the correlations between pairs of model parameters to represent the mediating effects between the predictors of wildfire probability. However, this algorithm doesn't seem to directly address the optimization of hyperparameters.

Therefore, without additional context, it cannot be determined how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.
