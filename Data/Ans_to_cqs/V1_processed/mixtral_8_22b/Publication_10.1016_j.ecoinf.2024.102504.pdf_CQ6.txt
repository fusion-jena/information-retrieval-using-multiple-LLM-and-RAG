Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved to ensure the data is suitable for input into the model. These steps can include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing or correcting any errors, inconsistencies, or missing values in the dataset. It may also involve handling outliers if they exist.

2. Feature Selection: Not all features in a dataset may be relevant to the problem being solved. Therefore, feature selection techniques can be used to identify and select the most important features.

3. Normalization or Scaling: Deep learning algorithms often perform better when numerical input variables are scaled to a standard range, such as between 0 and 1. This is because these algorithms use gradient descent optimization methods which work best when the input variables have similar scales. Common methods for this include Min-Max scaling, Z-score normalization, and log transformation.

4. Encoding Categorical Variables: If the dataset contains categorical variables, they need to be converted into numerical form since neural networks only understand numbers. Techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding can be used for this purpose.

5. Splitting Dataset: The dataset is usually split into three parts - training set, validation set, and test set. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the test set is used to evaluate the final performance of the trained model.

6. Data Augmentation: For certain types of data, particularly image data, it might be beneficial to artificially increase the size of the dataset using techniques like rotation, zooming, flipping, etc. This helps improve the modelâ€™s ability to generalize.
