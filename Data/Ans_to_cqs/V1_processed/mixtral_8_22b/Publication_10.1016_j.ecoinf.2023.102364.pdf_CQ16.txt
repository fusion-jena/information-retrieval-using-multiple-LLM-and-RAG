The text does not provide explicit information on the criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, based on common practices in machine learning, some potential criteria could include reaching a predefined number of epochs or iterations, achieving a desired level of accuracy or performance on a validation dataset, observing a plateau or decrease in the validation loss over time, or meeting other user-specified conditions. In this case, the authors mention using an ensemble of machine learning models trained with the combined 2014-2015 Short-billed Gull presence/absence data cube, but they do not specify the exact stopping criterion used for each individual model. Therefore, it cannot be determined definitively what criteria were used to determine when training was complete.
