The provided context does not directly address the query about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses the use of a random forest analysis with a feature selection algorithm to identify significant explanatory factors for the number of views on wildlife videos. This methodology might involve setting a random seed value to ensure reproducibility, but the context does not provide explicit details regarding how randomness is handled. In general, common strategies to manage randomness in deep learning pipelines include fixing the random seed value, using deterministic algorithms where possible, and employing techniques like cross-validation and ensemble methods to reduce variance caused by randomness.
