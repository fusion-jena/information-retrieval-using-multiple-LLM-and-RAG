The machine learning method mentioned in the given context uses the Enhanced Representation through Knowledge Integration (ERNIE) model. This model was developed by researchers including Wang et al. (2020), who described how it enhances semantic representation by directly modeling prior semantic knowledge units. It has been shown to perform well in various Chinese tasks, outperforming other models like the bidirectional encoder representations from the transformer model proposed by Google AI (Sun et al., 2019). Notably, the ERNIE model won first place at the International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation 2020 for a mixed-language emotional analysis task. Therefore, the deep learning model used in the pipeline is the ERNIE model.
