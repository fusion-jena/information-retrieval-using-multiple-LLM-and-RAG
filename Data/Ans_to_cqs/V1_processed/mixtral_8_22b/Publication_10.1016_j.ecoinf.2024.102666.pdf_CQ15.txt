The given context does not provide information about specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it discusses various aspects related to artificial neural networks (ANNs), atmospheric correction (AC) algorithms, and their applications in different aquatic environments. It also mentions studies comparing AC algorithms and their performance with different sensors and datasets. To find out more about optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines, one would need additional sources focusing specifically on this topic.
