The text does not provide explicit details on specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions several sources of data that can potentially be used for training AI models. These include images from social media platforms like Flickr and Instagram, CCTV footage, and imagery collected along linear infrastructure such as Google StreetView. Additionally, the text refers to 'wildlife recording apps or camera traps,' suggesting that sensor-based data collection methods are also employed. It is important to note that the use of publicly available datasets is implied through references to works that utilize such resources. In summary, while the exact methods for collecting raw data are not explicitly stated, the text suggests the use of various sources such as social media platforms, CCTV footage, sensor-based methods, and possibly publicly available datasets.
