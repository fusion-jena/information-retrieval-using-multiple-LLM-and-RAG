The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of a validation dataset. This dataset is an independent set of samples that is used to compute the accuracy and loss (estimation of the error during training) of the model. The validation dataset is used to assess the learning progress of the neural network. It indicates whether the model is overfitting the training data and not learning features that are key for recognition tasks. In this study, the authors initially trained the model for 10 epochs (passing the entire dataset through the neural network 10 times) with 200 manually labeled pictures. If the model performed poorly, additional pictures were manually labeled and added to the training dataset. This process was repeated until a satisfactory performance was achieved.
