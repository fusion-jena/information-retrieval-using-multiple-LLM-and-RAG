The deep learning model mentioned in this study uses the TensorFlow object detection API. Specifically, they use the pre-trained EfficientDet-D7 model weights from the TensorFlow-2 object detection model zoo page. Therefore, the primary framework used to build their deep learning model is TensorFlow.
