The provided context does not explicitly mention any methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge about deep learning pipelines, common methods for gathering raw data include surveys, sensors, and public datasets. Surveys involve collecting data through questionnaires or interviews, while sensors capture data from various sources like cameras, microphones, or other specialized devices. Public datasets refer to pre-existing collections of data available online, often curated by research institutions or organizations. In the case of the provided context, it seems that the authors might have used publicly available weather data (like temperature and humidity) or collected their own data via sensors or surveys to train their model. Nonetheless, without explicit confirmation from the source material, this remains speculative.
