The paper does not provide explicit information about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some general techniques can be mentioned based on common practices in machine learning and deep learning pipelines. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes or labels in both subsets. This helps prevent any imbalance between classes from affecting the model's performance.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to handle class imbalances in datasets. Oversampling increases the representation of minority classes by duplicating samples, while undersampling reduces the majority class by removing samples. Both methods aim to create a balanced dataset for better model performance.

Diverse data collection focuses on gathering a wide range of examples representing various scenarios, conditions, and variations within each class. This ensures that the model has enough exposure to different patterns and features, reducing potential biases caused by limited or skewed data.

While these techniques are commonly employed to mitigate data bias, their application depends on the specific characteristics and requirements of the dataset and problem at hand.
