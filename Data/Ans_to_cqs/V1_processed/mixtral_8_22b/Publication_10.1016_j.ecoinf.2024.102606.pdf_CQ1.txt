The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information given, we can infer that the authors might have used publicly available datasets, such as those provided by the PlantCLEF challenges, which offer large and complex image datasets for evaluating state-of-the-art machine learning models. Additionally, the authors may have also collected their own dataset through manual annotation, as mentioned in the evaluation of deep learning techniques for identifying Collembola on a new manually annotated dataset. It is possible that other methods, such as using sensors or conducting surveys, could have been employed, but these are not directly stated in the provided context.
