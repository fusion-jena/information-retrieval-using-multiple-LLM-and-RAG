To measure the generalizability of their deep learning model, the authors calculate the Ensemble Score (ENS) on four separate test sets. These test sets are designed to evaluate different aspects of model generalizability. However, the specific methods used for creating diverse datasets or implementing techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting are not explicitly mentioned in the given context. Therefore, it can be assumed that the diversity of the dataset might have been ensured by using the EarthNet2021 Challenge data, which includes 23,904 training datacubes spread across Europe. Nonetheless, further details regarding the exact methods employed to guarantee the model's generalizability cannot be determined based solely on the provided information.
