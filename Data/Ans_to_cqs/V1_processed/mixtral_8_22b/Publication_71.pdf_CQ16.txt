The table does not provide explicit information on the criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, it mentions a parameter called 'Training number of steps', which has a value of 'â‰¥100,000'. This suggests that the model may be trained for at least 100,000 steps before being considered complete. Additionally, there is no mention of validation loss or other metrics typically used to monitor and decide when to stop training. Therefore, based solely on this table, we cannot definitively state what criteria are used to determine when training is complete.
