The text provides information on the evaluation of a deep learning model used for detecting artisanal small-scale mining in Ghana using a Sentinel-2 based multispectral convolutional neural network. The performance of this model is evaluated using various metrics such as producer accuracy and user accuracy. These metrics are used to assess the accuracy of different land use and land cover (LULC) classes, including water, forest, bare soil, mining, and urban areas.

Producer accuracy refers to the proportion of correctly classified pixels out of the total number of reference pixels for each class. User accuracy, on the other hand, measures the proportion of correctly classified pixels out of the total number of predicted pixels for each class. Both these metrics provide insights into the reliability and validity of the model's predictions.

In the given context, the overall accuracy of the LULC maps for 1997, 2009, and 2019 were found to be 84%, 86%, and 81%, respectively, with an average overall accuracy of 84%. The highest accuracies were observed for the water and forest classes, while lower accuracies were reported for the mining and urban classes. Specifically, the mining accuracy improved from 70% (producer accuracy) and 76% (user accuracy) in 1997 to 99% (producer accuracy) and 94% (user accuracy) in 2019. Similarly, the urban accuracy increased from 72% (producer accuracy) and 68% (user accuracy) in 1997 to 99% (producer accuracy) and 91% (user accuracy) in 2019.

These improvements in mining and urban accuracy contributed to an increase in the overall accuracy of the map from 84% to 91%. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model employed in this study uses producer and user accuracy as key metrics to evaluate its performance in accurately identifying and classifying different LULC categories.
