In the given context, it is mentioned that the authors employed six popular deep learning models for their study. These models are InceptionResNetV2 (IR), ResNet50 (R), Xception (X), InceptionV3 (I), MobileNetV2 (M), and GoogleNet (G). All these models belong to the category of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs are widely used in image recognition and classification tasks due to their ability to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images. Therefore, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is CNN.
