The text does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does provide some clues about potential sources of data. The context mentions the use of aerial surveys for wildlife conservation, which suggests that aerial imagery could be one source of raw data. Additionally, the text discusses recent advancements in machine learning and deep learning techniques applied to remotely sensed imagery for wildlife conservation. This implies that satellite or drone-based remote sensing technologies might also contribute to gathering raw data. Furthermore, the references section includes articles on automated high-definition oblique camera systems and cameras replacing human observers in multi-species aerial counts. These citations indicate that camera systems mounted on aircraft could serve as another method for acquiring raw data. Therefore, while the exact methods are not specified, we can infer that a combination of aerial imagery, remote sensing technologies, and possibly other sources like publicly available datasets may be utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
