After the model training, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the project. Based on the given context, some possible postprocessing steps include:

1. Model evaluation metrics: The table titled "Comparison of model size, speed, and performance" presents various evaluation metrics such as top-1 accuracy, top-2 accuracy, top-3 accuracy, top-4 accuracy, top-5 accuracy, macro recall, and macro precision. These metrics provide insights into the overall performance of the models.

2. Confusion Matrix: Table 2 shows the confusion matrix for the InceptionV3 model, displaying the number of test images for each prediction. A confusion matrix is a useful tool for visualizing the performance of a classification algorithm, providing detailed information about correct and incorrect predictions.

3. Image Augmentation: Although not strictly a postprocessing step, it is worth mentioning that the authors employed an image augmentation strategy during the training phase. This technique involves applying transformations like rotation, cropping, shearing, and flipping to increase the diversity of the dataset and prevent overfitting.

The context does not explicitly mention saliency maps; however, they could also be considered as part of the postprocessing steps. Saliency maps highlight important regions in an image that contribute significantly to the final output of a deep learning model. They can be generated using techniques like GradCAM or Layerwise Relevance Propagation (LRP).
