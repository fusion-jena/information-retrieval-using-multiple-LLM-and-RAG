Unfortunately, the given context does not provide any specific information regarding the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline used for identifying bird species by their sound. However, it mentions two platforms relevant to bird observation and recording - eBird and Xeno-canto. These are both citizen science projects aimed at collecting and sharing bird-related data globally.

eBird is a large-scale citizen science program focused on birds, allowing users to submit bird sightings and observations. Its website can be found here: http://www.ebird.org.

Xeno-canto is a public, citizen-based birdsong repository hosting over 714,000 recordings of 10,300 bird species. This platform has enabled the development of machine-learning algorithms capable of automatically identifying 3000 bird species by their sound. You can access Xeno-canto through its website: http://www.xeno-canto.org.

While these resources do not directly address the query regarding the deep learning pipeline's data repository link, they are valuable tools for gathering bird-related data and might indirectly contribute to such pipelines.
