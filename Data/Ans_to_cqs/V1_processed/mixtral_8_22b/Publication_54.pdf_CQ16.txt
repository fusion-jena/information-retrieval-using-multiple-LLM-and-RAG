Based on the given context, the criteria used to determine when training is complete include achieving the highest accuracy possible on both the validation and test datasets. This is done by employing five-fold cross-validation to verify the predictive performance of the model. Additionally, a mechanism is proposed to swap the training and validation misclassified datasets, which helps enhance the performance and decrease overfitting in the selected model. However, the specific details about how the swapping process works or what constitutes the 'highest accuracy possible' are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. It should also be noted that models with fewer hyperparameters are easier to validate and tune, but if the model has many hyperparameters, a larger validation dataset is required.
