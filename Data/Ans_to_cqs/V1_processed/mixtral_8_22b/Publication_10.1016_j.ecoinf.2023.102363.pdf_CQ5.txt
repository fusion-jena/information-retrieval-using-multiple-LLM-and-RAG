The text does not provide explicit information about the specific dataset used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the model uses the EfficientNet B0 network, which was originally trained for generic image classification. It also states that audio data is input to the network in a novel spectrogram representation. Therefore, it can be inferred that the dataset used in the deep learning pipeline likely consists of images or spectrogram representations of audio data. Additionally, the text mentions that networks pre-trained on image data have been shown to perform well on classification tasks using spectrograms as image input. This suggests that the dataset may include both image and audio data. However, without more specific information, it cannot be determined exactly what datasets were used in the deep learning pipeline.
