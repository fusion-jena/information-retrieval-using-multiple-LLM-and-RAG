The text does not provide explicit information about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it mentions some preprocessing steps related to Support Vector Machines (SVM). These include selecting a distance metric, which is often Euclidean, based on the data's characteristics and specific analytical prerequisites. It also involves dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to retain most of the original data's variance. This step is crucial to prevent overfitting and improve the model's performance. Additionally, the text discusses the use of grid search and cross-validation to tune the regularization parameter ('C') and the kernel type (linear) for the SVM model. While these steps are specific to SVM, they can be applied to other machine learning algorithms, including deep learning models. Preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, and cleaning are common practices in preparing datasets for any machine learning algorithm, including deep learning models. Normalization scales numeric columns to a similar range, while scaling transforms features to have zero mean and unit variance. Cleaning involves handling missing values, outliers, and irrelevant data points. Although the text does not explicitly mention these steps, they are essential for improving the model's performance and should be considered when preparing datasets for deep learning models.
