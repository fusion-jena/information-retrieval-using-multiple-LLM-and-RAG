The text does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (train, test, or validation sets). However, it mentions using training samples and validation samples throughout the methodology section. It also refers to a five-fold cross-validation technique used during the feature pruning process. This suggests that the authors might have divided their data into training and validation sets, possibly using a random sampling strategy. They may have further employed k-fold cross-validation to ensure robustness and generalizability of their findings. Nevertheless, without more detailed information, we cannot definitively state the exact criteria used to split the data.
