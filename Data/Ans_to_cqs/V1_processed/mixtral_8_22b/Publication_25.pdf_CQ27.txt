Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide a detailed response about the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, generally speaking, after training a deep learning model, it needs to be serialized or saved so that it can be deployed for use in applications. This usually involves saving the model architecture along with its learned weights and biases into a file format such as.h5,.pkl, or.onnx. Once the model is serialized, it can be loaded and used for making predictions. As for platform selection, this depends on various factors including the application requirements, computational resources, and ease of integration with other components of the system. Common platforms for deploying deep learning models include cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure, as well as edge devices such as mobile phones, IoT devices, and embedded systems.
