Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization being used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, the text does discuss the issue of overfitting in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which is a common problem in deep learning models. The authors note that there is an optimal number of iterations before the performance on the validation and training sets begins to diverge due to overfitting. They suggest closely monitoring the performance throughout training and applying early stopping to avoid overfitting and improve accuracy. While these techniques do not directly address regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization, they are still relevant strategies for preventing overfitting in deep learning pipelines.
