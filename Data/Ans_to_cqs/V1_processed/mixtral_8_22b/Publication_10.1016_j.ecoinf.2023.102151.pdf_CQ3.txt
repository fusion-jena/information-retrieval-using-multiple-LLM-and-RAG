The given context does not provide specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, generally speaking, there are several common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines for tasks like object detection, image segmentation, etc. These include:

1. Bounding Box Annotation: This technique involves drawing a rectangle around the object of interest in an image. It is commonly used for object detection tasks where the goal is to identify the location of objects within an image.

2. Semantic Segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image with a class label. It is commonly used for scene understanding tasks where the goal is to understand the overall layout of a scene.

3. Instance Segmentation: This technique involves identifying and delineating individual instances of objects within an image. It is more detailed than semantic segmentation as it differentiates between multiple objects of the same class.

4. Polygon Annotation: This technique involves drawing polygons around objects of interest in an image. It is useful when dealing with irregularly shaped objects.

5. Landmark Annotation: This technique involves placing dots or points on key features of an object. It is commonly used for facial recognition tasks where the goal is to identify key facial features.

6. Line Annotation: This technique involves drawing lines along roads, rivers, or other linear features in an image. It is commonly used for map generation tasks.
