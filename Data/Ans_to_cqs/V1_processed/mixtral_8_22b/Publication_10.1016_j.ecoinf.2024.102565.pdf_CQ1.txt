The papers mentioned do not explicitly discuss the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general practices in the field, some common methods include:

1. Surveys or manual collection: For certain types of data, such as textual information or labeled images, human input is often required. This can be done through online surveys, crowdsourcing platforms, or manual labeling efforts.

2. Sensors: Various types of sensors can collect real-time data, including environmental sensors (for temperature, humidity, etc.), image sensors (for capturing visual data), and other specialized sensors depending on the application.

3. Public datasets: Many researchers use publicly available datasets for their work. These datasets may have been collected by government agencies, research institutions, or private organizations and made accessible to the broader scientific community. Examples include ImageNet for computer vision tasks, UCI Machine Learning Repository for various types of data, and many others.

Without more specific details about the context or domain, it is difficult to provide a more precise answer regarding which methods would be most appropriate for collecting raw data in this case.
