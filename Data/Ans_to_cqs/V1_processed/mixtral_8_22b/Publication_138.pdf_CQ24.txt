To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed. One common approach is to use a fixed random seed value across different runs or experiments. By setting a specific seed value, the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers will be generated each time, ensuring reproducibility and consistency in the results. Another strategy is to perform multiple runs with different random seeds and then average the results to reduce the impact of any single run's randomness. Additionally, techniques such as cross-validation, bootstrapping, and ensemble methods can help mitigate the effects of randomness by aggregating predictions from multiple models trained on different subsets of data. However, it should be noted that while these strategies can improve robustness and generalizability, they may not completely eliminate all sources of randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
