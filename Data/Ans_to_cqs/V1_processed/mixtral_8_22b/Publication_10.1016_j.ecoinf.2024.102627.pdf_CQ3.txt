Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does state that the method uses presence-only observations for training the deep species distribution model. Presence-only data refers to records where only the occurrence of a species is known, without any associated absence data. Therefore, it seems that the data annotation technique used here involves marking the locations where a particular species has been observed, rather than using more complex methods like bounding boxes or instance segmentation.
