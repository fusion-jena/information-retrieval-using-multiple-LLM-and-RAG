The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in this context is primarily for land use classification. It utilizes a recurrent neural network to analyze Sentinel-2 time series data. This model is applied in the context of the European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The goal is to improve the understanding of how such deep learning models operate, particularly in terms of their interpretability and explainability. This is crucial for applications where decisions need to be accountable, such as those involving public budgets or policy compliance.
