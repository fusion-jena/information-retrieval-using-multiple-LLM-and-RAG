The provided context does not explicitly mention specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning before training a deep learning model. However, it does discuss techniques used after training, like dimensionality reduction of embeddings and t-SNE, which could be considered post-processing methods rather than preprocessing ones. Preprocessing typically involves preparing raw data into a suitable format for machine learning algorithms, while post-processing focuses on refining or interpreting the outputs of these algorithms. Therefore, without further context, I cannot provide a detailed list of preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.
