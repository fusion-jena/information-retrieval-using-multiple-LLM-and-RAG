The study employs several strategies to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model. Firstly, they use a diverse dataset consisting of multi-temporal data drawn from a three-month span across three different environments. This diversity helps the model to better understand and classify various forest types. Secondly, they utilize transfer learning, leveraging the pre-trained ResNet-34 architecture, which has been trained on large datasets such as ImageNet. This allows them to apply existing knowledge to their specialized task with limited data. Lastly, they employ a LOGO (Leave-One-Group-Out) cross-validation method. In this approach, one complete 450m multitemporal transect is left out during each iteration of the training process before being tested. This ensures that every multitemporal transect is evaluated, taking into account the constraints of their data and ensuring that the model performs well even when presented with new, unseen data.
