The text does not provide explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, based on common practices in machine learning, some possible postprocessing steps could include generating saliency maps to visualize which parts of the input image contribute most to the model's predictions, calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate the model's performance, and creating confusion matrices to understand how well the model can distinguish between different classes. These postprocessing steps would typically be applied to the test set (T2) mentioned in the text, which was used to compare the performance of various deep learning and few-shot learning models.
