The given context does not provide information about any specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training for the auto-encoder mentioned in Fig. 1 or the method described in section 3. However, based on general machine learning practices, some common postprocessing steps could include evaluating the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc. Additionally, creating confusion matrices or visualizing saliency maps might also be useful for understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the model. But since there is no explicit mention of these steps in the provided context, I cannot confirm if they were applied in this particular case.
