The purpose of the deep learning model in this research is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, it can be inferred from the abstract and introduction sections that the goal is likely related to improving the recognition or classification of Taeniura lymma, commonly known as the Bluespotted ribbontail ray. This is supported by references to previous works that have used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for fish species classification and seal identification. Therefore, it can be assumed that the deep learning model being developed here is intended for either classification or recognition tasks involving Taeniura lymma.
