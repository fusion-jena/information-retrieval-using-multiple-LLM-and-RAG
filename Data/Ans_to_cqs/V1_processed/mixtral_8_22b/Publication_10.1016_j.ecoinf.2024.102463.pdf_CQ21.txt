Unfortunately, there isn't any information about specific postprocessing steps mentioned in the given context. However, based on common practices in machine learning, some possible postprocessing steps could include calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score; creating confusion matrices to visualize the performance of the classifier; generating saliency maps to understand what parts of the input data contribute most to the predictions made by the model; or performing cross-validation to ensure the robustness of the results. These steps can help evaluate the quality of the model and improve its performance if necessary.
