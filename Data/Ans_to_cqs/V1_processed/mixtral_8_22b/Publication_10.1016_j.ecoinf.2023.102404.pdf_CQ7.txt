In the given context, the data splitting strategy employed for the machine learning model is not explicitly mentioned as being specifically for a deep learning model. However, the information does provide details about how the data was divided into training and testing sets.

A stratified random sampling approach was used to capture the full distribution of Above Ground Biomass (AGB) values within the Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)-derived AGB maps accurately. In this approach, a randomly selected half of the pixels were used for the training and testing split. This ensured that the training/testing dataset accurately represented the distribution of AGB values within the LiDAR-derived AGB maps.

Additionally, a random number seed was used to ensure reproducibility, and multiple seeds were evaluated to select the one that provides the most stable and reliable results. Cross-validation techniques were also employed during the grid search process to evaluate the model's performance.

However, there is no explicit mention of a separate validation set or any specific criteria used to create such a set. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, it can be concluded that the data was primarily split into training and testing sets using a stratified random sampling approach, with a focus on maintaining the distribution of AGB values across both sets.
