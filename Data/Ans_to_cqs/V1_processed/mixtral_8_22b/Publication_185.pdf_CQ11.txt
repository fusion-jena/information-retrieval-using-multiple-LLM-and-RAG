Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide the exact data repository link of the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context. It would be necessary to refer to the original research paper or contact the authors directly to obtain this information. However, some common repositories where such pipelines might be shared include Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, and GBIF.

Based on the context provided, we only know that the experiments were conducted on a small-sized dataset without data augmentation. Two models, MG and MO, were used and achieved good training results when the parameters were chosen properly. These models also performed well in their respective validation sets. The study demonstrated that it is possible to use small datasets to train deep learning models effectively, particularly in the field of image recognition.

However, no specific details about the dataset or the deep learning pipeline used in these experiments are provided in the given context. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the data repository link for the deep learning pipeline.
