Unfortunately, based on the given information, there isn't enough detail to provide a specific answer about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the researchers utilized TensorFlow and Keras, which are popular libraries for building and training deep learning models. These tools offer functionalities for saving or serializing models after training, which can then be loaded and deployed on various platforms. For instance, serialized models can be deployed on cloud platforms like Google Cloud ML Engine or AWS Sagemaker, or they can be integrated into web applications or mobile apps. Nevertheless, without explicit details regarding the deployment process, these possibilities remain speculative.
