The given context does not provide information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, common postprocessing steps include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, or accuracy, creating confusion matrices, and visualizing results using tools like TensorBoard or Matplotlib. These steps help evaluate the performance of the model and identify areas for improvement.
