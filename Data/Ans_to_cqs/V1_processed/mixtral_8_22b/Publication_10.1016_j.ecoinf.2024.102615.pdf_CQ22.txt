The study uses several metrics to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. These include the correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), coefficient of determination (R^2), and mean relative error (MAE). The correlation coefficient (R) measures the linear relationship between two variables, with values ranging from -1 to 1. Values closer to 0 indicate a weaker correlation and better model performance. The root mean square error (RMSE) calculates the average magnitude of the errors made by the model, while the mean absolute error (MAE) provides the average absolute difference between predictions and actual observations. The coefficient of determination (R^2) represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the independent variable(s). Lastly, the mean relative error (MAE) gives the average relative difference between predicted and observed values.
