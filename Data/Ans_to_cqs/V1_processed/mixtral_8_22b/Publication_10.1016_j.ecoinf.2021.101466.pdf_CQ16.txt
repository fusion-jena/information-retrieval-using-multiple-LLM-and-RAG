The given context does not provide information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed for either YOLOv4 or EfficientNet models. However, common practices include monitoring metrics such as validation loss and accuracy during training, and stopping the process once these values reach a plateau or desired threshold. Other techniques like early stopping can be employed to prevent overfitting by halting the training if no improvement is observed after several epochs.
