During the training process, the model performance was continuously monitored using the validation set. The learning curves depicted in Figure 6 show how the training losses decreased as the number of epochs increased, eventually leading to convergence within 500 epochs. Specifically, Inceptionv3 converged around 400 epochs, while the remaining networks converged within 150 epochs. Among these networks, those based on the ResNet architecture, particularly ResNet50 and ResNet101, demonstrated superior performance compared to their counterparts.
