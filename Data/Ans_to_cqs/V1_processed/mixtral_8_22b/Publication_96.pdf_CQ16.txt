Based on the given information, it does not explicitly state what criteria are used to determine when training is complete. However, typically in machine learning algorithms, common criteria include reaching a certain number of epochs or iterations, achieving a desired level of performance such as a minimum validation loss or maximum accuracy, or observing no further improvement in the validation set after several epochs. In this case, the algorithm uses a fixed number of interactions (7,000) during the training phase, so one possible criterion could be completing these interactions.
