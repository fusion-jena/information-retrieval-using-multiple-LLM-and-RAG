The article does not provide information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It mentions that ecoinformatics focuses on curating and mining large databases collected over long time periods across multiple locations, but it does not specify any particular repositories or platforms used for storing or sharing these databases. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available based on the given context.
