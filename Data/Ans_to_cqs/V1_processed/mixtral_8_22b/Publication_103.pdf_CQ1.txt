The given context does not provide explicit information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, there are references to two datasets - ImageNet and Herbarium1K. This suggests that the authors might have used publicly available datasets or collected their own dataset for this study. Unfortunately, without more specific details, it cannot be determined whether they used surveys, sensors, or any other means to collect the data.
