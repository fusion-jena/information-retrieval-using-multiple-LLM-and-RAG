Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide a direct link to the data repository of the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context. However, it can be noted that the paper by Ren, D.-F., Cao, A.-H., Du, W.-J., published in 2023, titled "Ecosystem service value and changes in food supply and demand in Liaoning Province" in Chinese Journal of Soil Science, uses a deep learning algorithm in its strategic planning. This suggests that this paper might contain more details about the specific deep learning pipeline used. To find out if the authors made the code or dataset publicly accessible, one could search for the article online using databases like Google Scholar or Web of Science, then check the full text or supplementary materials for any links to repositories such as GitHub, Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
