Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some commonly used techniques include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training, validation, and test sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes within each subset. Oversampling increases the representation of minority classes by duplicating examples from those classes, while undersampling reduces the representation of majority classes by removing examples from them. Diverse data collection aims to gather more representative data by collecting samples from various sources, conditions, and environments.

In the context provided, the authors mentioned using a dataset split ratio of 80:10:10 for training, validation, and testing sets, respectively. They also stated that they independently trained five different versions of the YOLOv5 model family. However, there is no information about whether any specific technique was employed to handle data bias during preprocessing.
