The text does not provide explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention various datasets (Dataset 1 - Dataset 31) and spectral indices such as NDVI, EVI, SAVI, BSI, MNDWI, and NDMI, which could imply the use of remote sensing data collected via satellite imagery or other aerial platforms. Additionally, the reference to the Random Forest algorithm suggests the use of machine learning techniques for processing and analyzing the collected data. Nevertheless, without further context, it is impossible to determine the exact methods employed for gathering raw data.
