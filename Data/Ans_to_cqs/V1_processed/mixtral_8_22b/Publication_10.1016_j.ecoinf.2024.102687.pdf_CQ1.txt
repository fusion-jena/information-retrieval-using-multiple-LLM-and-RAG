Based on the given context, no explicit information is available regarding the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the original feature extraction part of the meta-learning algorithms was replaced with four CNN pretrained on the ImageNet dataset. Additionally, it discusses automatic identification of biophonic sources in soundscape recordings through the use of supervised classification models. From these points, we can infer that one possible method for collecting raw data could involve utilizing publicly available datasets like ImageNet for pretraining purposes. Another potential approach could entail employing soundscape recordings for gathering acoustic data relevant to ecological studies. Nevertheless, without additional context, it remains unclear whether other methods such as surveys or specialized sensors are also employed in the process.
