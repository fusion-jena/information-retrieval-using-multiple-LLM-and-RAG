According to the given context, the data was split into two sets: a training set and a validation set. The training set consisted of 30 videos, while the validation set contained 300 videos. This split was used to tune parameters and evaluate the system, respectively. However, the specific criteria used to determine which videos were included in each set are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, based solely on the information available, it cannot be determined what exact criteria were used to split the data for deep learning model training.
