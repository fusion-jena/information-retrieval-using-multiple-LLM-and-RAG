Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to provide the exact data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The sources mentioned in the text are mostly scientific papers discussing various aspects of marine biology, such as the effect of water motion on coral photosynthesis and calcification, marine pollution and coral reefs, differential distribution of octocorals and scleractinians, etc. There is no mention of any specific deep learning pipeline or its associated data repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide the required information.
