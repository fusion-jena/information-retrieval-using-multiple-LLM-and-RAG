In this study, several types of deep learning models are employed. For instance, feed-forward regression networks are utilized in [11, 26], while a combination of CCNN and ResNeXt models is implemented in [11]. However, the primary focus of the paper appears to be on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), specifically the UNet model, which is a CNN architecture initially proposed for biomedical image segmentation. Additionally, the Model-K architecture is mentioned, which is a regression model based on VGG16, another popular CNN architecture. Furthermore, EfficientNet-B5, also a CNN, is discussed as a feature extractor in Model-2. Therefore, the main type of deep learning model used in this pipeline is CNNs.
