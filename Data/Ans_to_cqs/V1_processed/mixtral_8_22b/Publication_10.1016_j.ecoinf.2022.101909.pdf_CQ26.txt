To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets while maintaining the original class proportions. This ensures that each subset has a representative sample of all classes, reducing the risk of biased results due to unequal distribution of samples across classes.

Oversampling is a technique where additional copies of minority class examples are added to the dataset to balance it out. This helps prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class. However, oversampling may lead to overfitting if not handled carefully.

Undersampling, on the other hand, involves removing instances from the majority class until both classes have equal representation. While this reduces the overall size of the dataset, it can help mitigate the effects of class imbalance.

Lastly, collecting diverse data is crucial to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data. This includes gathering data from various sources, environments, and conditions to capture the full range of variability present in real-world scenarios. By incorporating diverse data, the model becomes more robust and less prone to biases introduced by limited or skewed datasets.
