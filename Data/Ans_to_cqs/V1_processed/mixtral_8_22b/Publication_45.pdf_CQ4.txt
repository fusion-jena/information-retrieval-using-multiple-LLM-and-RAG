The given context does not provide explicit information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge, some common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, padding, and adding noise. Data augmentation is often used to improve model performance and prevent overfitting by increasing the amount of training data. It involves creating modified versions of existing images or datasets through various transformations. Flipping can involve horizontal or vertical flips, while rotation involves rotating the image by a certain degree. Scaling changes the size of the image, either enlarging or shrinking it. Cropping removes parts of the image, while padding adds extra pixels around the edges. Adding noise introduces random variations to the image. These techniques help the model learn to recognize different orientations, sizes, and distortions of objects, improving its ability to generalize to new data.
