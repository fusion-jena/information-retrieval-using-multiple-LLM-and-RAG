Based on the given context, it appears that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from several mentions of CNNs throughout the text, such as "operations across the three main layers of CNNs" and "Within the model architecture, the conventional combination of convolution (Conv), batch normalisation (BN), and ReLU forms >80% of the model structure". Additionally, there are references to specific CNN architectures like ResNet-50, Inception V3, and DenseNet. However, without explicit confirmation or additional context, I cannot definitively state that only CNNs are being used in the pipeline.
