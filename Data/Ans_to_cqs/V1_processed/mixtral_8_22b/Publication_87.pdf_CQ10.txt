Unfortunately, based on the given information, there is no explicit mention or reference to any specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline discussed in the case study. Therefore, I cannot provide the exact link to the GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository containing the source code for the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the case study. However, if you have access to additional resources related to this research, such as published papers or articles, they might contain links to the relevant code repositories.
