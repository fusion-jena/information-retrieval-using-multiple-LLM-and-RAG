The study utilizes a ground-based profiling canopy LiDAR (PCL) multi-temporal dataset sourced from a small yet representative region in the central Amazon. The area is characterized by a marked gradient in soil texture and soil drainage along a mature hillslope or topographic profile. LiDAR surveys were conducted at high, medium, and low points along the topographic gradient, referred to as Plateau (p), White-sand (w), and Riparian (r), respectively. This unique, multi-temporal LiDAR dataset is used to explore the relationships between terrain variation and forest structure, providing valuable insights into the ecological dynamics of the region. Additionally, the study incorporates multi-temporal data drawn from a three-month span (March, September, and October 2015) across three environments to create a larger dataset for training and testing deep learning models.
