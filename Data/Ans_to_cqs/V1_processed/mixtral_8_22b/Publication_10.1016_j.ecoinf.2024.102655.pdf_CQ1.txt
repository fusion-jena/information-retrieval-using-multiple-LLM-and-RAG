Based on the given context, it appears that the study focuses on analyzing water quality parameters (WQP) using machine learning techniques. However, there isn't any explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in this case. Generally speaking, when dealing with environmental studies like this one, researchers often use various types of sensors or probes to collect real-time data on water quality parameters such as pH levels, temperature, turbidity, etc. Additionally, they may also rely on manual sampling and laboratory testing to gather more detailed information regarding chemical composition and biological indicators. Public datasets can be another source of relevant data, but again, no mention has been made of their usage within this particular research project.
