The given context does not provide information about specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, scaling, etc., used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer to this query based on the available context. However, the context discusses several approaches to improving the accuracy of land use/land cover (LULC) mapping using remote sensing (RS) data. It mentions the use of larger sample sizes, undersampling, oversampling, and combinations of both to address the issue of imbalanced training data. Additionally, it highlights the introduction of a hexagonal random-sampling strategy along with a tile model to enhance the accuracy of LULC mapping. Image presegmentation is also mentioned as a technique to retain the advantages of object-based classification without requiring time-consuming parameter adjustments. Lastly, the text suggests incorporating convolutional neural networks (CNN) and deep neural networks (DNN) deep-learning algorithms into future studies for LULC mapping in arid zones.
