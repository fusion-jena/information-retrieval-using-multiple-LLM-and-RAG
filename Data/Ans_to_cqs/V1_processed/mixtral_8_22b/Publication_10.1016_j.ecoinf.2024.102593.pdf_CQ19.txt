The deep learning model is built using TensorFlow, which is a popular open-source software library for machine intelligence. It was developed by Google Brain Team and released under the Apache License 2.0. TensorFlow provides APIs for beginners and experts to develop ML-powered applications. In this study, TensorFlow is used to train the SincNet models and generate embeddings using the BirdNET model. Additionally, TensorFlow Hub is mentioned as a resource for pre-trained models. However, there is no explicit mention of other deep learning frameworks like PyTorch being used in this research.
