Based on the provided context, it does not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, common practices in machine learning include evaluating the performance of the trained models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc. Additionally, confusion matrices can be generated to visualize the performance of the classifier. Other techniques like saliency maps may also be employed depending upon the application requirements. But without explicit information about these aspects in the provided context, we cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the postprocessing steps involved after the model training.
