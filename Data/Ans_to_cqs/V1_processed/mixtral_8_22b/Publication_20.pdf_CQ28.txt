Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that the authors used the Cafe framework developed by Berkeley AI Research and community contributors. Therefore, it can be inferred that they did not use any cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform but rather deployed their model locally using the Cafe framework.
