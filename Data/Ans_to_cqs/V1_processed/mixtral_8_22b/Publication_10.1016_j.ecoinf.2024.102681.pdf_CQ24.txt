None of the provided sources directly address the issue of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, specifically regarding random seed values. However, some common strategies to manage randomness include setting specific seed values for reproducibility or using techniques like cross-validation and ensemble methods to reduce the impact of randomness on model performance. It should be noted that these strategies may not be explicitly mentioned in the given references.

Based on the information available, I cannot provide a more detailed response addressing the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline related to the given context.
