Regularization methods are techniques used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function during training. Two common regularization methods mentioned in the given context are Dropout and L2 Regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored or "dropped out" during training, which helps prevent complex co-adaptations between neurons. This makes the model more robust and reduces overfitting. During each iteration of the training process, some percentage of nodes are temporarily removed along with their incoming and outgoing connections. This forces the network to learn redundant representations of features and prevents it from relying too heavily on any individual node.

L2 Regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty equivalent to the sum of squares of all the weights multiplied by a constant factor to the loss function. By doing so, it discourages large weights, effectively limiting the capacity of the model and preventing overfitting. It encourages smaller and more distributed weight values, promoting a simpler model that generalizes better.

These regularization methods help improve the performance of both traditional machine learning methods like Support Vector Regression (SVR) and deep learning methods like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks when predicting dissolved oxygen concentration in water bodies.
