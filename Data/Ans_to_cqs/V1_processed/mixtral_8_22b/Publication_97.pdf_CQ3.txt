Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, considering the nature of the problem being addressed - forest damage identification, which is a semantic segmentation problem - it can be inferred that the technique used might involve pixel-level labeling or semantic segmentation. This involves assigning labels to each pixel in the image, indicating the object or region it represents. In this case, pixels would likely be labeled as either 'damaged' or 'undamaged'. Unfortunately, without more detailed information, it cannot be confirmed if other techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation were also employed.
