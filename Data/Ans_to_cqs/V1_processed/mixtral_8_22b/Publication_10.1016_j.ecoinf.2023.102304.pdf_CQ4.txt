The given context does not provide information about specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotation, or scaling. However, it discusses the use of remote sensing data and optimization of parameters for capturing the response of different indices to post-fire recovery. It also mentions the improvement in overall accuracy and kappa when using optimized parameters compared to default ones.

In general, data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotation, and scaling are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to increase the amount of training data available and reduce overfitting. By applying these transformations to existing images, new variations of the original data are created, which helps the model learn more robust features and improves its performance on unseen data.

However, without explicit mention of these techniques in the provided context, we cannot confirm if they were specifically employed in this case.
