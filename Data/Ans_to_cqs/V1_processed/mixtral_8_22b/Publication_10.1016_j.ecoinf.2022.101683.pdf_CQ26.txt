The text discusses various techniques used to address sampling bias in Invasive Species Distribution Models (iSDMs) which can be considered as part of the preprocessing stage in a machine learning pipeline. Three primary methods are mentioned:

1. Weighted Background Points: This technique involves assigning weights to background points to account for uneven sampling efforts across the study area. By doing so, models can give more importance to underrepresented regions, thus reducing the effect of sampling bias.

2. Filtered Records: Also referred to as spatial filtering, this approach aims to mitigate potential spatial autocorrelation bias by reducing the spatial resolution of species records or decreasing the density of species records in densely populated clusters. Reducing the resolution of species records to one record per 10 kmÂ² has shown to increase the predictive power of models.

3. Targeted Background Points: This method selects background points based on specific criteria, such as proximity to observed presences or similar environmental conditions. By carefully selecting background points, models can focus on relevant areas and minimize the influence of unimportant locations.

In addition to these methods, the text mentions other treatments applied to iSDMs to test the impact of potential biases and errors:

- Random backgrounds: Using 100% of training records and selecting background points randomly from the entire modeling extent.
- Spatial filtering input data: Thinning out species records based on their kernel density to remove a larger proportion of sightings from high-density areas.

These techniques help improve the quality of input data and reduce the effects of sampling bias, ultimately leading to more accurate and reliable models.
