The authors used several methods to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model. They employed diverse datasets, including various physiographic descriptors such as altitude, slope, aspect, solar radiation, and others. To evaluate the performance of their model, they conducted cross-validations, which revealed consistent patterns of bias. Specifically, they observed negative average pbias values during the hot season and positive average pbias values during the cold season. This suggests that the model may have had difficulty capturing certain climate-forcing effects not initially present in the coarse-scale products. Additionally, they compared the training data at the calibration points with the projection data over the study area to obtain 12 surfaces of the Shape extrapolation metric for both WorldClim and CHELSA, one for each month. However, it is important to note that the specific details regarding stratified splitting or other techniques commonly used to improve model generalization are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
