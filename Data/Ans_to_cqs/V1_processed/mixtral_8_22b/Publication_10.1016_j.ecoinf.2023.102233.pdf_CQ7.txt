The data was split into three sets: training, validation, and test datasets. Each successive model iteration was trained on 70% of the training data and validated against 30% of the training data. This train/validation split approach aimed to minimize potential overfitting of the model on small sample sizes. The choice of this method was based on its effectiveness in comparison to a cross-validation approach. For the final evaluation of the model, a separate test dataset was used.
