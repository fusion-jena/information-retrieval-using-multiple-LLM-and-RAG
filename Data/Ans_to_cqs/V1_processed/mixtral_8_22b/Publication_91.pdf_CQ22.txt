The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using two main metrics: per-channel accuracy and F-measure. Higher values of both metrics indicate better performance, while lower values suggest poorer performance. Per-channel accuracy refers to the proportion of correctly classified samples for each individual channel, while the F-measure is a measure of a test's accuracy that considers both the precision and recall of the test to compute the score. Precision measures the number of true positive results divided by the number of all positive results returned by the classifier, including those not belonging to the target category. Recall, also known as sensitivity, measures the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives.
