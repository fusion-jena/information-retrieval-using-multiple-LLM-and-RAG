The given context does not provide explicit information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed for the U-Net model. However, based on common practices in machine learning and deep learning, some possible criteria include:

1. Validation Loss Plateau: One commonly used criterion is monitoring the validation loss during training. When the validation loss stops decreasing or reaches a plateau, it may indicate that the model has learned all it can from the data, and further training will not improve its performance significantly. This is often referred to as early stopping.

2. Maximum Number of Epochs: Another approach is setting a maximum number of epochs or iterations through the entire dataset. Once this limit is reached, training is considered complete regardless of whether the model has converged or not.

3. Learning Rate Schedule: Some models use a learning rate schedule where the learning rate is gradually reduced over time. Training could be considered complete once the learning rate has been reduced to a minimum value.

4. Performance Metrics: In classification tasks like the one described in the context, metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or Jaccard index can be monitored during training. The training process might be stopped when these metrics reach a satisfactory level or stop improving.

Without more specific details about the training procedure followed in the work presented in the context, it is impossible to pinpoint which exact criteria were used to determine when training was complete.
