The deep learning pipeline described uses two types of data formats: TIF (Tagged Image File Format) and SHP (Shapefile). The TIF format is used for storing raster graphics and images, specifically for the classification results predicted by the DeepLabV3+ algorithm. On the other hand, the SHP format is employed for vector data storage, such as the segmentation results obtained from MRS (Multi-Resolution Segmentation). These formats are commonly used in geospatial applications and remote sensing analysis.
