Based on the given information, it appears that the authors do not explicitly mention the exact methods used for collecting raw data in their deep learning pipeline. They discuss using audio spectrograms constrained to 128 x 128 pixel RGB images with values repeated in each color channel to produce a greyscale image. However, they do not provide details about how these audio spectrograms were obtained or what type of raw data was collected before processing. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the methods utilized for collecting raw data in their deep learning pipeline.
