The given context does not provide information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions some general steps involved in data cleaning and preprocessing, including text filtering, Chinese text segmentation, word segmentation, and stop word removal. It also discusses the use of machine learning models like the Enhanced Representation through Knowledge Integration (ERNIE) model for emotion analysis tasks. But there is no mention of any techniques specifically aimed at addressing data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this query.
