To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the model was trained on a diverse dataset, which likely included various features related to bark beetle outbreaks in conifers. This diversity in the dataset helps prevent overfitting and improves the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data. Secondly, the hyper-parameters of the model were evaluated iteratively, including network capacity (number of layers and neurons per layer), applied regularization techniques, the used loss function, and optimizer. Regularization techniques help reduce overfitting by adding constraints to the model during training, while the choice of loss function and optimizer can significantly impact the performance of the model. Lastly, the training of each candidate network was stopped when the accuracy of the network on the test dataset did not improve further. This early stopping technique prevents overfitting by halting the training process before it starts fitting noise in the training data. Although the text does not explicitly mention cross-validation or stratified splitting, these techniques could have been employed as part of the evaluation process to further enhance the model's generalizability.
