Based on the given context, it appears that the criteria used to determine when training is complete are not explicitly mentioned. However, we can infer that the authors might have considered factors such as convergence of precision (P), recall (R), and mean Average Precision (mAP50) during training, as well as the loss of classification loss (cls\_loss) during validation. This information is presented in Figure 11, where the convergence of these metrics is shown for four experimental models (Experiments 1, 2, 7, and 10). It is also worth noting that the number of epochs was specified as 150 in the experimental training parameter settings. Therefore, one possible criterion could be reaching the maximum number of epochs. Nevertheless, without explicit mention of the stopping criteria, it remains uncertain what specific conditions were used to decide when training should be terminated.
