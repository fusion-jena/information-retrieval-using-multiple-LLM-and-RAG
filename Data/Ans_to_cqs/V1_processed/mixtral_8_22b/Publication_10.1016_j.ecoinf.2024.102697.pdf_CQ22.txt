The text does not explicitly mention any specific metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it mentions that hyperparameter optimization was performed using Bayesian Optimization to minimize a 5 k-fold cross-validation loss during model development. This suggests that the performance of the model might have been evaluated using cross-validation techniques, which could involve various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or others depending on the nature of the problem being solved by the model.
