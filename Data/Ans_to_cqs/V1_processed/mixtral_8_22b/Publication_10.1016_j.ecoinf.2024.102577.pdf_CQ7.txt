Based on the provided information, it appears that the authors used a 5 x 10-fold cross-validation approach for evaluating the performance of their models. This means that they divided their dataset into five equal parts or folds, and then performed ten iterations of training and testing. During each iteration, one fold was held out as the test set while the remaining four folds were used for training. The process was repeated until each fold had served as the test set once. However, there is no explicit mention of how the data was split for validation purposes. Therefore, based solely on the provided information, we cannot determine the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training.
