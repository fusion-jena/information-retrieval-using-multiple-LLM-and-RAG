Based on the given context, there is no information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized using methods like grid search or random search. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this specific query.

However, it should be noted that the context does mention the use of the Jenks natural breaks optimization method for classifying NDVI data. This method is not directly related to optimizing hyperparameters but rather focuses on finding optimal classifications based on natural groupings in the data.
