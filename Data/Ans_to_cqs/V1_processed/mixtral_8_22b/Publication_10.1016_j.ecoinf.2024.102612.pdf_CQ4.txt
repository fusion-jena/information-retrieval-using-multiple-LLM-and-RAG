The text does not provide specific details about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that data augmentation is used to address the need for large training datasets in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), which can be achieved using an external simulator. It also states that current research on LiDAR point cloud simulations predominantly embraces two perspectives: aerial and terrestrial, specifically Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS), Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS), and Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) point clouds. Therefore, while we cannot specify the exact techniques used, based on common practices in deep learning, possible data augmentation techniques could include flipping, rotating, scaling, translating, cropping, and adding noise to the data. These techniques help increase the diversity of the dataset and improve the generalization capabilities of the model.
