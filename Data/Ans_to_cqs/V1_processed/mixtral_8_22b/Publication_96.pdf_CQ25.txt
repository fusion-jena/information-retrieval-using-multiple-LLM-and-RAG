In this study, the purpose of the deep learning model was to classify and map burned areas within the Cerrado biome in Brazil. Specifically, the researchers utilized a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model, which is a type of learning algorithm based on an artificial neural network with multiple hidden layers. This model was trained to distinguish between burned and non-burned areas using spectral training samples collected from the study area. Once trained, the model was then used to develop predictions and subsequently validate its performance. Ultimately, the goal of employing this deep learning model was to create an efficient and accurate methodology for identifying and mapping burned areas across large geographic scales.
