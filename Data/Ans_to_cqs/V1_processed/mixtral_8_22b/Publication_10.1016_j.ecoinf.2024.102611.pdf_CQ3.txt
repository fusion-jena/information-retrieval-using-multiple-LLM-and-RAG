The given context does not provide specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipelines mentioned. However, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and landmark annotation. These techniques are often employed depending on the type of dataset and the problem being solved. For example, object detection tasks may use bounding boxes or instance segmentation, while semantic segmentation can be useful for scene understanding tasks. Polygon annotation is typically used for irregular shapes, while key points and landmarks are helpful for identifying specific features within images. Without more detailed information from the context, it cannot be determined which specific annotation techniques were used in these deep learning pipelines.
