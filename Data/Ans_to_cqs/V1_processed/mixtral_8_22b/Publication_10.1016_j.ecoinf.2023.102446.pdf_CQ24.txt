Based on the given context, there isn't any direct mention or discussion about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, including the use of random seed values. However, some common strategies to manage randomness in deep learning pipelines include fixing the random seed value, using deterministic algorithms, and employing techniques like cross-validation and ensemble methods to reduce the impact of randomness on model performance.

I apologize for not being able to provide a more specific answer based on the given context.
