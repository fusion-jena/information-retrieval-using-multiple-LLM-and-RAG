The provided context does not explicitly mention specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. However, it does discuss the use of remote sensing (RS) imagery and representative training samples in the context of land use/land cover (LULC) mapping. This suggests that remote sensing data collection methods like satellite or airborne imagery could be used to gather raw data for this application. Additionally, the context mentions the use of machine learning algorithms, including support vector machines (SVMs), random forests (RFs), decision trees (DTs), and artificial neural networks (ANNs), which would require input data collected through these means.
