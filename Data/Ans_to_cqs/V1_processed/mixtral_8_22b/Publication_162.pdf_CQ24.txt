The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it discusses some aspects related to improving the robustness and reliability of deep learning models. For instance, the authors used a ResNet-50 model pre-trained on ImageNet, which helps reduce variability due to random initialization. They also augmented their training dataset using additional images obtained from internet search engines, but they had to apply filtering techniques to deal with noisy annotations. These methods contribute to enhancing the overall performance and stability of the deep learning pipeline, although they do not directly address handling randomness caused by factors like random seed values.
