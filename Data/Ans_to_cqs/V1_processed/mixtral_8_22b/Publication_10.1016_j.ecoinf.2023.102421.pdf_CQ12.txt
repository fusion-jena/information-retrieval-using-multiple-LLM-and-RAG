After reviewing the given context, it seems there might be some confusion regarding the use of deep learning models in this pipeline. The context primarily discusses hyperparameter optimization for machine learning models, specifically focusing on XGBoost and LightGBM. These are not deep learning models but rather gradient boosting frameworks often used for regression and classification tasks.

XGBoost stands for Extreme Gradient Boosting, a popular and efficient implementation of the gradient boosting framework. On the other hand, LightGBM is another gradient boosting framework developed by Microsoft, known for its high efficiency and low memory usage. Both of these models are used for tuning hyperparameters using Bayesian Optimizers and Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (TPE) in this pipeline.

In summary, the context does not mention any deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers being used in the pipeline. Instead, it focuses on the application of XGBoost and LightGBM for hyperparameter optimization and model selection.
