Based on the given context, it appears that the authors took several measures to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model. However, they did not explicitly mention using diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting techniques. Instead, they focused on other aspects such as feature extraction, feature selection, and model evaluation.

To enhance the robustness of their model, the authors employed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with multiple convolution kernel pooling layers to extract deep features from the input data. This approach allowed them to capture complex patterns within the data, thereby improving the overall performance of the model. Additionally, they included a dropout layer in the fully connected layer to minimize overfitting by reducing the number of network parameters.

Regarding feature selection, the authors utilized a combination of handcrafted features (F1, F2, and F3) along with automatically learned features (F4, F5, F6, and F7) derived from various transformations like Fourier Transform (FT), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), and Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs). They also explored the fusion of these features to further boost the model's discriminative power.

Moreover, the authors evaluated their proposed models using a comprehensive dataset consisting of both training and testing subsets. Specifically, they allocated 80% of the data for training purposes and reserved the remaining 20% for testing. By doing so, they aimed to assess the model's ability to generalize well to unseen data, thus ensuring its applicability in real-world scenarios.

Overall, although the authors did not directly address specific techniques such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, they still implemented several strategies to promote the generalizability of their deep learning model. These include employing a sophisticated feature extraction process, incorporating a variety of handcrafted and automatically learned features, and rigorously evaluating the model's performance on a separate testing subset.
