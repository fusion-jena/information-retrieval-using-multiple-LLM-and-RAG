Based on the given context, it appears that the purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated. However, considering the topic of the research and the mentioned applications of other machine learning algorithms, we can infer that the deep learning model might be used for prediction or estimation purposes. Specifically, it could be employed to predict water quality parameters using hyperspectral data from satellite imagery. This is supported by the mention of deep learning being used for estimating chlorophyll a concentrations in inland water bodies (Maier & Keller, 2021). Therefore, without explicit information about the specific task of the deep learning model, we can assume that its purpose is likely related to predicting or estimating water quality parameters based on hyperspectral data.
