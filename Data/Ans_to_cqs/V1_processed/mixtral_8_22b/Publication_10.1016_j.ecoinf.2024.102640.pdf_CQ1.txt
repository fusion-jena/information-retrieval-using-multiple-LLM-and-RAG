The authors do not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in their deep learning pipeline. However, they reference several existing datasets that could potentially be used for training their models. These include COCO-Stuff, Cityscapes, and ADE20K. They also mention creating a new dataset called UGE-D specifically for GVI extraction. While the exact methodology for gathering these datasets isn't detailed here, typically such datasets can involve various techniques like using sensors or cameras for capturing images, manual labeling or annotation, and sometimes even crowdsourcing.
