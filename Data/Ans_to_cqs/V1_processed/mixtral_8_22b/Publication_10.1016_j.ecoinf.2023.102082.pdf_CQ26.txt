The given context does not provide specific details about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and deep learning approaches for generating high-resolution Canopy Height Models (CHMs) from Sentinel-2 optical images. It also discusses the fusion of GEDI data and Sentinel-2 images using a deep learning algorithm to improve spatial precision.

In general, when dealing with data bias in deep learning pipelines, several techniques can be employed during preprocessing. These include stratified splitting, where the dataset is divided into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes or features. This helps prevent overrepresentation or underrepresentation of certain classes or features in either set.

Oversampling involves duplicating examples from the minority class to balance the dataset, while undersampling removes examples from the majority class to achieve the same goal. Both methods aim to mitigate imbalanced datasets, but they may introduce other issues such as overfitting or loss of valuable information.

Diverse data collection focuses on gathering a wide range of examples representing different scenarios, conditions, or populations to ensure the trained model performs well across various situations. This technique can help reduce bias introduced by limited or skewed data sources.

While these techniques are commonly used to address data bias during preprocessing, the choice of method depends on the specific problem, dataset characteristics, and desired outcomes. The given context does not explicitly mention any of these techniques being applied to the deep learning pipeline for generating CHMs.
