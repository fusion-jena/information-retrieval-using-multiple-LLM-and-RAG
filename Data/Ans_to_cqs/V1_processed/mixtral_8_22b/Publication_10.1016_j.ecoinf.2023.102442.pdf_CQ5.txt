The paper does not explicitly mention any specific dataset used in their deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that they use Google Earth Engine (GEE) for the initial land use/land cover (LULC) classification. GEE is a cloud processing platform that provides a public catalog containing petabytes of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets. This suggests that the authors may have used satellite imagery data available on GEE for training their deep learning model. It is also worth noting that the authors mention using higher resolution images (such as those from Sentinel-2) for identifying smaller components like patches of vegetation and bare soil, while lower resolution images (like those from MODIS) were deemed unsuitable due to their inability to identify these smaller features. Therefore, it can be inferred that the authors likely used high-resolution satellite imagery data from sources like Sentinel-2 for their deep learning pipeline.
