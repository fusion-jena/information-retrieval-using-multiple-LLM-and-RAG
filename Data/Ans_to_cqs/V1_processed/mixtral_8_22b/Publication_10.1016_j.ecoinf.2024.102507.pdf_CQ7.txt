The text does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, based on common practices in machine learning, it can be assumed that the researchers followed standard procedures such as splitting the data into training, validation, and testing sets. Typically, the training set is used to fit the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final performance of the model. In this case, the researchers mentioned using data augmentation techniques, which suggests they might have used part of their dataset for training and another part for validation during the model tuning phase. Nevertheless, without specific details from the provided context, it is impossible to determine the exact criteria used by the researchers for splitting their data.
