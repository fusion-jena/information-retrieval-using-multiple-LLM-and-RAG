The text does not explicitly mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that class weights were computed for addressing class imbalance, which suggests that some form of weight balancing or adjustment might have been implemented. This could be considered a type of oversampling technique, where the minority class samples are given more importance during training. Additionally, the use of diverse data collection methods, including various brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue modifications, as well as random horizontal and vertical flips and rotations, can help increase the variety of data and potentially reduce bias. Furthermore, incorporating Gaussian noise into the dataset may also contribute to improving the robustness of the model under different conditions.
