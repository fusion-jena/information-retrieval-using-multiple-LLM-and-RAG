The performance of the deep learning model can be evaluated using several metrics, each providing unique insights into its effectiveness. These include Precision, Recall, and F1 Score. Precision measures the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of positive predictions, indicating the proportion of correct positive classifications. Recall calculates the proportion of truly positive cases that the model accurately identifies out of all actual positive instances. The F1 Score combines both Precision and Recall by taking their harmonic mean, offering a more balanced assessment, especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets. By examining these metrics together, one can achieve a more accurate understanding of the overall performance of the deep learning model.
