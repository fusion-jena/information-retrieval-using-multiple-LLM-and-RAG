The text mentions one regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline - dropout. Dropout is a technique where some neurons are randomly ignored or 'dropped out' during training, which helps to make the model more robust and prevents overfitting. In this case, it is applied to avoid overfitting in the LSTM model. Other common regularization techniques include L1 and L2 regularization, but these are not mentioned in the given context.

Based on the information provided, the LSTM model uses the dropout layer for regularization to prevent overfitting. The dropout layer works by randomly excluding some inputs from activation and weight updates while training the network. Inputs not set to zero are scaled up by 1/(1 - rate) such that the sum over all inputs remains the same.
