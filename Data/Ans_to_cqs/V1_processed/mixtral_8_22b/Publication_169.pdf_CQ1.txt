The paper utilizes a publicly available dataset called "One-hundred plant species leaves data set" from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains images of various plant species in grayscale format. It appears that the authors did not collect their own raw data but instead relied on existing datasets for their research. Therefore, no specific method for collecting raw data is mentioned in the given context. However, it should be noted that the use of publicly available datasets is a common practice in deep learning research, especially when dealing with image classification tasks. These datasets often contain labeled examples that can be used to train and evaluate models without the need for manual labeling or collection of new data.
