The text does not provide explicit information about the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It only mentions that a trained teacher model, often represented as an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) or Deep Neural Network (DNN), is employed to guide the learning process of a student model. The term 'Artificial Neural Network' is quite broad and encompasses many types of architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTMs), etc. Therefore, without additional context, it cannot be determined what exact type of deep learning model was utilized in the described pipeline.
