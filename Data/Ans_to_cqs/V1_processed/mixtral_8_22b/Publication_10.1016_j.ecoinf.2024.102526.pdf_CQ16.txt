The provided context does not directly address the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. However, based on general machine learning practices, some common criteria to determine when training is complete can be suggested. These include observing the model performance on a separate validation dataset over time, looking for signs of convergence or stabilization in the validation loss, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or other relevant evaluation metrics. Additionally, early stopping techniques can be employed to halt training once the validation metric stops improving significantly after a certain number of epochs. It is important to note that these suggestions are not explicitly mentioned in the given context but are generally applicable principles in machine learning.
