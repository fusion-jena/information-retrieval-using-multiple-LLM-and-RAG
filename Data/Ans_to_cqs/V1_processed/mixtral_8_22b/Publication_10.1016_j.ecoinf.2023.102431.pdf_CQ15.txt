The given context does not provide information about any specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), etc. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query based on the given context.

Based on the provided context, Alibhai et al. (2023) have developed a more efficient method for the Feature Identification Technique (FIT) process, which requires fewer landmark points and can be applied to tracks of varying quality. They use a predictor screening analysis with bootstrap forest partitioning to determine the most important features from 124 potential FIT metrics. This analysis employs 1000 decision trees to evaluate the contribution of each predictor on the response object.

The researchers then use the selected top predictor variables to assess the dataset for potential biases related to foot position (using either left-front or right-front tracks) and observer bias (differences among multiple observers manually marking landmark points). A stepwise variable selection procedure with a threshold p-value of 0.05 is utilized to choose the variables with the highest discriminating power. Linear discriminant analysis is performed to create a discrimination line or hyperplane, depending on the number of variables included in the final model, to classify species or sex. Uncertainty in classification is measured by generating bands of uncertainty around the discrimination hyperplane and assigning probabilities to values within these bands using a logistic regression model.

However, there is no mention of any specific optimization techniques like SGD or Adam being used in the deep learning pipeline.
