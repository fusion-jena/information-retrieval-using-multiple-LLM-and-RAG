To ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model, the authors employed the hold-out method to separate the test set and the training set at a ratio of 3:7 for preprocessing the original data. This approach helps prevent overfitting and allows the model to perform well on unseen data. Additionally, they further adjusted the parameters of the networks to investigate the influence of parameters on experimental results and discuss the selection of frame parameters. However, it should be noted that while this method does help improve the model's performance, other techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting could have been used to further enhance its robustness and reliability.
