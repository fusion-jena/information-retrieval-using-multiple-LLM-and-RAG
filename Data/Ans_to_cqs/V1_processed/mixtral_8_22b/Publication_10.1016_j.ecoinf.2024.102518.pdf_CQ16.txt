The text does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, it mentions that the optimal model is determined based on the minimum delta.AICc value (delta.AICc = 0), and a model with delta.AICc <2 is considered credible. This suggests that the training might be stopped once the model reaches its optimal state or when further improvements do not significantly impact the model's performance. Additionally, the use of cross-validation and evaluation metrics such as AUC-ROC and Cohen's Kappa could also play a role in determining when training should stop. Nonetheless, without more detailed information regarding the training process, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact criteria used to decide when training is complete.
