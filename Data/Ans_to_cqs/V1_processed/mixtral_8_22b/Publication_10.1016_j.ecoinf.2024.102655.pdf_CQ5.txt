The given context does not provide specific details about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it discusses some general aspects related to datasets used in machine learning models, particularly those applied to water quality studies. According to the text, an ideal dataset should represent all possible states of the modeled system, but this might be challenging due to the nature of environmental processes, which are slow and seasonal, producing repetitive datasets. Moreover, using too much data could lead to model overtraining and precision loss. In the case of water quality datasets, they usually contain many parameters with redundant information. Therefore, careful selection of training data subsets based on historical variation analysis is recommended to improve the training process and achieve better predictive outputs.
