Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to provide the exact code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the proposed model uses a VGG style network and SubSpectralNet for classifying bird sounds. You may want to look into the references mentioned in the text, such as reference [17] by M. Lasseck or reference [19] by S. S. R. Phaye, E. Benetos, and Y. Wang, as they might contain more specific information about the implementation or even links to the relevant code repositories.
