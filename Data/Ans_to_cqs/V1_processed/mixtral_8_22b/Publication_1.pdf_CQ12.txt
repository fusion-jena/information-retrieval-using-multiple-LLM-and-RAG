Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific details about the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It mentions that deep learning techniques are being employed to process and analyze wildlife data streams, but it does not specify whether they use convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers, or any other type of deep learning architecture. Therefore, I cannot determine which type of deep learning model is used in their pipeline based solely on this context.
