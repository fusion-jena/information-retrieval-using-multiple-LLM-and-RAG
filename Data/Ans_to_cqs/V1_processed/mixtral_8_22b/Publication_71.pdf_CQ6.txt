The given context does not provide explicit information about any specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model like normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it mentions some adjustments required when dealing with four-channel input images instead of the standard three-channel RGB images. In particular, the DeepLabV3+ architecture needs to be modified to accommodate four-channel input images, and either a new model must be trained from scratch or the weights for the newly added image bands should be learned while initializing the weights of RGB input channels using pre-trained model weights through transfer learning. Additionally, the context suggests that larger batch sizes are recommended for efficient model training in DeepLabV3+, implying that resizing or splitting the dataset might be necessary depending on the available computational resources.
