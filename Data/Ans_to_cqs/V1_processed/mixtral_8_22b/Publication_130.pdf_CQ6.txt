Based on the given context, it appears that one of the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model is oversampling. This technique involves creating copies of the training data from the less sampled classes, particularly when dealing with small training datasets. By doing so, it helps to mitigate overfitting and prevents the model from updating its weights during the training process. Additionally, selecting appropriate images for the validation dataset and ensuring that the training dataset contains sufficient variation to capture the broad range of contexts that the model is required for are also crucial preprocessing steps.
