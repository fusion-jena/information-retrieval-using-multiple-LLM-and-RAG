Based on the given information, there is no direct mention of how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether they used methods such as grid search or random search. However, it can be noted that the authors did perform cross-validation by splitting their data into training and testing sets, as well as selecting the best performing models based on their results.
