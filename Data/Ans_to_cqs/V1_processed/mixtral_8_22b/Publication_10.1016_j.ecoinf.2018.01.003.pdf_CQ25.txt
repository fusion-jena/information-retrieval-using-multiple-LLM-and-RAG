The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, it can be inferred from the text that deep learning algorithms are used to extract deeply hidden characteristic information and features beyond what was previously possible with traditional neural networks. This suggests that deep learning models may be used for tasks such as image or speech recognition, natural language processing, or other complex pattern recognition problems where identifying subtle patterns or relationships in the input data is important. Additionally, the fact that these models can handle a larger number of layers than traditional neural networks implies that they may be particularly well-suited for handling high-dimensional data or very complex problems. Without further context, however, it is difficult to determine the specific purpose of any particular deep learning model mentioned in the passage.
