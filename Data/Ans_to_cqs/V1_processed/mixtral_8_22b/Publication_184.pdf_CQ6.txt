Before training a deep learning model such as the Yolo model mentioned in the given context, several preprocessing steps can be taken to improve its performance. These include providing not only the class of the object but also the bounding box data of the object as the correct answer. This involves parsing the x, y coordinates, width, and height of the object in the annotation of the image's dataset. Additionally, data augmentation techniques can be employed to increase the amount of available data. Data augmentation helps to extend the amount of information by adding adjusted copies of already existing data, acting as a regularizer and reducing overfitting. Before inputting the images into the model, they can be randomly sampled using various transformations like horizontal flip, grayscale conversion, blurring, adding noise, or cropping. Furthermore, selecting appropriate hyperparameters for training and validation is crucial. In the given context, the table presents the hyperparameters used to train and validate the Yolo model, including the number of iterations, epochs, learning rate, batch size, and subdivisions.
