The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it can be inferred from general machine learning practices that common methods include random splitting or stratified sampling based on class distribution. In this case, since the article mentions a focus on land use classes, it might suggest using stratified sampling to ensure each subset has a similar representation of these classes. Nevertheless, without specific information about the data splitting methodology, we cannot provide a definitive answer.
