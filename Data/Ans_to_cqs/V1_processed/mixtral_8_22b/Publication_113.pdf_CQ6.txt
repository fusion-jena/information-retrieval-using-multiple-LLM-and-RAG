The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does discuss some aspects related to preparing data for training a deep learning model.

In the context of active learning, the process begins with a small, randomly selected labeled subset of data. This implies that the data might need to be split into labeled and unlabeled sets beforehand. Additionally, the context mentions fine-tuning a previously trained network on a target dataset, suggesting that transfer learning could be applied as a preprocessing step.

While these points do not directly address the query regarding specific preprocessing techniques, they provide insights into how data preparation may occur within the broader scope of deep learning and active learning. It should also be noted that common preprocessing steps for deep learning models include image resizing, normalization, augmentation, and tokenization for text data.
