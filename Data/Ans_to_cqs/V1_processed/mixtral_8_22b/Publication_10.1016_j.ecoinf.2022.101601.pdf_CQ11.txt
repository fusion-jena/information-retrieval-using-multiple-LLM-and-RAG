Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to provide a direct link to the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses limitations of certain methods and tools used in modeling, along with various factors affecting permafrost distribution and thaw depth. It does not mention any specific deep learning pipelines or their corresponding data repositories. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based solely on the given context.
