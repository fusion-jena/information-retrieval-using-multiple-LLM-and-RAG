The deep learning-based models exploited in this research were implemented using the TensorFlow framework, which is a Python library designed to facilitate efficient analysis and implementation of deep learning with GPUs. The experiments were conducted on a 64-bit Intel i7-8700K@3.70GHz CPU workstation equipped with 64GB memory and an NVIDIAÂ® GTX 1080 GPU with 12GB of memory. The operating system used was Debian 4.195.98-1 version.
