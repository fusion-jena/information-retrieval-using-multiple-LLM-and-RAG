The text does not provide explicit information about the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, we can infer that the study involves remote sensing data, specifically spectral bands and digital elevation model (DEM) data. These types of data are typically represented in raster or grid format, where each cell contains a value representing the reflectance or height at that location. Additionally, the study mentions using EarthExplorer, a platform that provides access to various satellite imagery and remote sensing products. Therefore, it is likely that the deep learning pipeline uses some form of image data, such as multispectral images or DEMs, as input.
