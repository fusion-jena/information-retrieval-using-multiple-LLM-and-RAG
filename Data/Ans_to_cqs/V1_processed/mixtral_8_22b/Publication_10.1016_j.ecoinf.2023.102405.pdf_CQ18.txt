The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves initializing empty lists to store the training loss and accuracy for each epoch. During each epoch, the total loss and total correct predictions are initialized to zero. Then, the training data is randomly shuffled and split into mini batches of size â„Ž. For each mini batch, the gradients of the model parameters are zeroed before being updated based on the calculated loss between the predicted labels and the true labels. After updating the model parameters, the total loss and total correct predictions are also updated. This process allows for tracking the progress of the model throughout the training phase.
