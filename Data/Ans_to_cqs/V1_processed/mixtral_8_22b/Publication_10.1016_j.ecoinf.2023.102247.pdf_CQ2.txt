The information provided does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the given context, it appears that the researchers utilized environmental variables related to temperature, precipitation, and distance to roads or rivers. These types of data are typically represented in numerical format, often stored in structured files like CSV (Comma Separated Values) or similar tabular data formats. It is also possible that they could be processed into arrays or matrices suitable for machine learning algorithms. Nevertheless, without explicit confirmation, I cannot definitively state the exact data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.
