Based on the provided context, there is no information about specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer that the Random Forest algorithm is used in the PLUS model for obtaining development probabilities of each land use type. Additionally, the ANN is mentioned as being used in the FLUS model for determining development probabilities. But neither of these algorithms are optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). Therefore, without additional context, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
