In the given context, it is mentioned that the data from the first eight days were used as the training set, and the data from the last two days were used as the validation set. This indicates that the criterion used to split the data for deep learning model training was temporal, i.e., based on time. Specifically, the data collected during the initial period (first eight days) was used for training the model, while the data collected during the subsequent period (last two days) was used for validating the model. This approach is commonly used when dealing with time series data, where the goal is often to forecast future values based on historical observations. By splitting the data into training and validation sets based on time, one can ensure that the model is evaluated on unseen data that comes chronologically after the training data, which helps to assess its performance more accurately.
