Regularization methods are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise along with underlying patterns, which leads to poor generalization performance on unseen data. Two popular regularization methods mentioned in the given context are dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent complex co-adaptations between neurons. By ignoring some neurons, the network becomes more robust and less likely to rely heavily on any single feature or pattern. Dropout effectively creates an ensemble of many neural networks within a single network, improving its ability to generalize.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the sum of squared weights. This encourages smaller weights, making the model simpler and less prone to overfitting. The strength of this penalty is controlled by a hyperparameter called the regularization parameter, which balances the tradeoff between fitting the training data and maintaining simplicity.

In summary, both dropout and L2 regularization are employed to combat overfitting in deep learning pipelines. Dropout achieves this by creating ensembles of neural networks through random neuron selection, while L2 regularization promotes smaller weights via a penalty term added to the loss function.
