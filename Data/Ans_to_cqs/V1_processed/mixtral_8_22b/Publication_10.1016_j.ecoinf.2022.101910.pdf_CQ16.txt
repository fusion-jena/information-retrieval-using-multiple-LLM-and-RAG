The context does not provide specific information on the criteria used to determine when training is complete for automated recognition software such as BirdNET or Kaleidoscope Pro. However, generally speaking, common criteria used to determine when training is complete include a validation loss plateau, where the model's performance on the validation set stops improving; early stopping, where training is stopped once the model's performance on the validation set starts degrading; or reaching a predefined number of epochs or iterations. These criteria help prevent overfitting and ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data.
