The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, based on common practices in machine learning, some typical preprocessing steps include normalization or scaling, where input features are rescaled to have a mean of zero and unit variance; cleaning, where missing values, outliers, or irrelevant data points are removed or handled appropriately; encoding categorical variables into numerical form if necessary; and splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. These preprocessing steps help ensure that the model converges faster, performs better, and generalizes well to unseen data.
