Based on the given context, it appears that the study does not use a deep learning model but rather an ensemble modeling approach in the BIOMOD2 package in R. This approach combines four different models, including regression-based and machine-learning models such as Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Therefore, there are no specific hyperparameters related to a deep learning model mentioned in the context.
