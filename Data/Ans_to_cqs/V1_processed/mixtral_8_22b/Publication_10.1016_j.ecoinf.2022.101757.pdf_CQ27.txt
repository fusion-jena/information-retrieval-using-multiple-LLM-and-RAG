The authors used an already trained implementation of DeeplabV3+ for their study. The specific implementation they used can be found on GitHub (<https://github.com/zllrunning/deeplab-pytorch-crf>). This implementation was trained using the COCO dataset, which contains over 120,000 images and nearly 900,000 object annotations across 184 different classes. The COCO dataset is commonly used to benchmark the performance of computer vision models. In order to extract common objects below the skyline, the authors did not retrain the model on their own set of landscape photos; instead, they applied the pretrained model directly to these photos. Unfortunately, the text does not provide information about how exactly the trained model was deployed or any details regarding model serialization or platform selection.
