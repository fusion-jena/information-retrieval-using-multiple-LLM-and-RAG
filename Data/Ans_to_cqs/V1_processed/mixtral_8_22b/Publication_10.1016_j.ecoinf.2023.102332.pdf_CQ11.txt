The given context does not provide information about the specific data repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in this case. However, it mentions several sources where datasets were obtained for training purposes, such as the ukWaC corpus, Wikipedia, and the British National Corpus (BNC Consortium, 2007). Additionally, it refers to the use of the pre-trained baroni word2vec model available at <http://www.lingexp.uni-tuebingen.de>. Unfortunately, without further details, it is impossible to determine if these resources are still accessible or if they have been moved to another location. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct link to the deep learning pipeline's data repository.
