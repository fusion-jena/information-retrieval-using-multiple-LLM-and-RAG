The article does not explicitly state the specific file format used for the input data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions several types of data used, including Near Infrared (NIR), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference RedEdge Index (NDRE), visible NDVI (vNDVI), and Digital Surface Model (DSM). These are typically represented as numerical arrays or matrices, often stored in formats like.csv,.txt, or.npy for Python NumPy arrays. Additionally, the use of UAS (Unmanned Aircraft Systems) suggests that images might have been used as well, likely in common image formats such as.jpg,.png, or.tiff.
