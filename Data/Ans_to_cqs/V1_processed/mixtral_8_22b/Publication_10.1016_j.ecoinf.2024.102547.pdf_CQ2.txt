Based on the given context, it appears that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned. However, considering the nature of the study, which involves analyzing a multifrequency acoustic dataset acquired from scientific echosounders in West African waters, it can be inferred that the data format used is likely related to acoustic signals or waveforms. Acoustic data is typically stored in formats like.wav files for audio signals or specific binary formats for more complex acoustic data. In this case, the data might include information about marine organism aggregations, such as thickness, relative density, and depth, in relation to their environment. Therefore, while the exact data format is not specified, it is reasonable to assume that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is related to acoustic signal processing rather than common formats like images, videos, or CSV files.
