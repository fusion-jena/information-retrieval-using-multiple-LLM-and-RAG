The given text does not mention any specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. Therefore, it cannot be determined from this context what type of hardware resources were utilized for training the deep learning models.

Based on the available information, we can only infer that machine learning models like Random Forest (RF), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Support Vector Regression (SVR) were employed for predicting various algal-related parameters. However, there is no explicit reference to the use of GPU or TPU resources for training these models.
