In order to monitor the model performance during training, a strategy involving multiple datasets is employed. This includes the use of a target training set, a validation set, and a target test set. The target training set is utilized to train the target model, while the validation set is used to validate the hyperparameters. Meanwhile, the target test set serves to evaluate the classification accuracy of the target model. Additionally, there exists an attack set containing non-members, which is necessary for training the attack model. Furthermore, images from the target validation set serve as representations of members. Lastly, the evaluation set encompasses non-members with identities distinct from those used to construct the attack model.

This approach ensures that the model does not suffer from overfitting, which is a common issue in machine learning where the model performs exceptionally well on the training data but fails to generalize effectively on new, unseen data. Overfitting is particularly problematic in the domain of privacy, as it renders the model susceptible to privacy breaches due to its excessive retention of training set information. By employing these various datasets, the model's performance can be closely monitored throughout the training phase, thereby mitigating the risk of overfitting and enhancing overall model robustness.
