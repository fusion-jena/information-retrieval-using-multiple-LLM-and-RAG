The given context does not provide any direct information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It discusses various aspects of the research conducted on birdsong classification using deep learning models like Vision Transformers (ViT). However, there is no mention of the specific location of the code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available based on the provided context.
