The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, based on the information provided, we can infer that the deep learning models used in these case studies are primarily designed for classification tasks. This is evident from Table 1, where the accuracy of candidate models is measured using the proportion of correctly classified cases, and the accuracy of selected models is measured using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Additionally, the context mentions various types of architectures such as ResNet, InceptionTime, LSTM, and CNN, which are commonly used for image and signal processing tasks like classification, object detection, and segmentation. Therefore, without explicit mention, we can assume that the deep learning models discussed here are likely being used for classification purposes.
