The given context does not explicitly mention any specific hardware resources such as GPUs or TPUs used for training a deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which hardware resources were utilized based solely on this information.

The context primarily discusses the use of Sentinel-2 satellite data, its integration with other datasets like GEDI, and the application of remote sensing techniques for aboveground biomass density (AGBD) modeling. It also mentions the use of regression analysis and the extraction of spectral values from Sentinel-2 bands. However, there is no reference to the type of computational infrastructure employed for these tasks.
