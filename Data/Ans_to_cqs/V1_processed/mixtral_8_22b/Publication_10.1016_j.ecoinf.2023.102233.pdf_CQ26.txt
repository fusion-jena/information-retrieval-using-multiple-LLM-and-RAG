The text does not explicitly mention any specific techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss a technique used to mitigate the impact of data bias caused by the active learning process. This technique involves selecting audio frames for review based on the model's predictions, which helps to account for a highly imbalanced dataset. Furthermore, a random selection approach stratified across the model's predictions (logits) was employed to reduce class imbalance within the evaluation data. This approach altered the distribution of data but allowed for the calculation of reliable evaluation metrics. It should be noted that additional research is required to investigate more appropriate evaluation methods for highly imbalanced and unlabelled test data.
