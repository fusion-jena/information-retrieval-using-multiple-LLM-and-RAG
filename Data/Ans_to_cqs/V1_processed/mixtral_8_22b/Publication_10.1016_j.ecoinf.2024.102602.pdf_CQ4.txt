The authors have mentioned using a data augmentation approach to increase the size of the training dataset and improve the model's ability to generalize across different scenarios and conditions. However, they did not explicitly mention the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. Nevertheless, based on common practices in computer vision tasks, it is reasonable to assume that some commonly used data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, scaling, and cropping might have been employed.

Final 
Although the paper does not explicitly state the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, it is likely that common techniques such as flipping, rotating, scaling, and cropping were utilized.
