In this study, the initial objects are outlined as vectors in the given Sentinel-1 images and then converted into the darknet annotation format. The conversion process involves creating text files containing information on the label class of objects and their positions in the image. The Sentinel-1 images are also cropped into smaller image tiles of 640 x 640 pixels, resulting in a total of 1609 images with corresponding label files. Out of these images, 20% are selected as validation data, while the remaining 80% are used for model training. The targets are displayed in single-polarization greyscale, either HH or VH. Therefore, it can be concluded that the primary data annotation technique used in this deep learning pipeline is bounding box annotation.
