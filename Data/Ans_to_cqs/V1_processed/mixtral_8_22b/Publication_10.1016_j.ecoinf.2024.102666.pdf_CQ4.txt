Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention or discussion about specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, scaling, etc., used within the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss various algorithms and models employed for satellite image processing and atmospheric correction, including artificial neural networks (ANNs) and the Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes (FLAASH) model. It also mentions the use of different sensors like Sentinel-2 MSI and Sentinel-3 OLCI for comparative analysis. Unfortunately, without further information regarding the deep learning pipeline utilized in this work, I cannot provide details on the exact data augmentation techniques applied.
