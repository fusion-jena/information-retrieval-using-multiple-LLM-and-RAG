Based on the given context, it does not provide information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for this study. However, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest within images or videos. Semantic segmentation is the process of classifying each pixel in an image into a category, while instance segmentation involves identifying individual instances of objects within an image. These techniques can be applied to various types of data, including text, audio, and video, depending on the requirements of the project. In this case, without further context, it cannot be determined which specific technique was employed.
