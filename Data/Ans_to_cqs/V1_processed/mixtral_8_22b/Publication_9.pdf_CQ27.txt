The text does not explicitly mention the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. However, it mentions that they created a website to serve as a repository for the fish segmentation model, suggesting that the deployment involved hosting the model on this website. Additionally, the use of the VGG Image Annotator tool indicates that the team likely went through a process of labeling and preparing the dataset before feeding it into the deep learning model for training. After training, the model would have been saved and possibly optimized for efficient inference before being deployed onto the web server.
