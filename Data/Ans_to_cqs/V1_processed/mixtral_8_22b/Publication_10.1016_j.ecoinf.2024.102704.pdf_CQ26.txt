The given context does not provide specific information about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some commonly used techniques to handle data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and validation sets while maintaining the same class distribution in both sets. Oversampling is a technique where samples from the minority class are duplicated or synthesized to balance the class distribution. Undersampling, on the other hand, involves removing samples from the majority class to achieve balanced classes. Lastly, collecting diverse data helps ensure that the trained models generalize well to different scenarios and populations.

In summary, although the given context does not explicitly mention these techniques, they are widely used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. These methods include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.
