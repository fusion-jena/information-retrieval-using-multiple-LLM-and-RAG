The data repository used for the NGEE Tropics project is called the NGEE Tropics Archive. This archive allows users to upload and access data packages through a web portal. It is supported by a programmatic REST API built on top of the Django Python web framework, with an easy-to-use web user interface built with the Foundation (Zurb, 2016) front-end framework. However, it does not appear to be one of the commonly known data repositories mentioned in the query, such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, it seems that the specific data repository for the deep learning pipeline may not be publicly accessible or listed among the common data repositories.
