In this study, the authors used Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) satellite images and Deep Neural Network models to detect and map burned areas within the Cerrado biome. They collected spectral training samples of burned and non-burned areas for the entire study area, which were then used to train the deep learning models. However, the authors do not explicitly mention any standard datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in their deep learning pipeline. Instead, they focus on utilizing remotely sensed data from Landsat 8 OLI satellite images and custom training samples tailored specifically for their research objectives.
