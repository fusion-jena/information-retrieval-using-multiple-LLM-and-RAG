Based on the given information, it appears that the method used for selecting the optimal parameters for the model is not explicitly mentioned. However, it is stated that the parameter selection was performed by minimizing the mean squared error. Unfortunately, without further details about the specific methods employed during the parameter selection process, such as whether a grid search, random search, or another technique was utilized, I am unable to provide a more precise response.
