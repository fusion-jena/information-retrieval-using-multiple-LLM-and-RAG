Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about which specific frameworks or libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch were used to build the deep learning models. However, it mentions that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were utilized, specifically VGG, Inception, and ResNet architectures. These architectures can be implemented using various deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, etc. Without further details, I cannot determine the exact framework used in building the deep learning models.
