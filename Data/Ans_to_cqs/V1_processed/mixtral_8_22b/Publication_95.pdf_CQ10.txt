Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available from the provided context to determine the exact code repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in this study. However, we can infer some details about the tools and libraries used in the research process.

From the context, we learn that the researchers utilized Keras [24] which is a high-level neural networks API written in Python. It is capable of running on top of TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, or PlaidML. This suggests that the deep learning pipeline might have been built using one of these frameworks.

Additionally, the authors mention using both ResNet50-v2 [22] and MobileNet-v2 [23] architectures for image classification tasks. These architectures are widely popular and readily available within the Keras library. Therefore, it is possible that the researchers directly imported these architectures into their pipeline without any significant modifications.

Lastly, the paper mentions that both network structures include weights pre-trained on ImageNet [26]. This implies that the researchers may have leveraged transfer learning techniques during the development of their deep learning pipeline.

In conclusion, while we cannot provide the specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the study, we can confirm that the researchers made use of popular deep learning libraries such as Keras and possibly TensorFlow, along with well-known architectures like ResNet50-v2 and MobileNet-v2. They also likely employed transfer learning by utilizing pre-trained weights from ImageNet.
