A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used in the pipeline. This can be seen in Fig. 2, which shows a model of the deep learning layer, and Table 3, which lists combinations of the convolutional neural network deep learning model parameters. Additionally, the text mentions that a CNN is commonly used to process two or more dimensions of data with high complexity, such as images or sound data.
