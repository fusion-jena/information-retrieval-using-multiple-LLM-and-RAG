To evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, several metrics are used. In this case, the experimental results show that the Average Precision (AP) and mean Average Precision (mAP) are used to measure the accuracy of the object detection task. AP is defined as the area under the precision-recall curve, while mAP is the average AP over multiple Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds ranging from 0.5 to 0.95. Additionally, the time metric is used to calculate the runtime of preprocessing, network inference, and post-processing stages. Furthermore, the model size is considered when evaluating the performance of the deep learning model.
