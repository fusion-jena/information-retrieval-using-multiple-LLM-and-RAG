Based on the given context, there isn't any specific mention of standard datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in the deep learning pipeline. Instead, the context suggests that the dataset used consists of grids containing various features such as land use type, soil, topography, elevation, slope, aspect, distance to settlements, distance to roads, and distance to rivers. These features were collected from six different years - 1986, 2005, 2008, 2010, and 2013. Additionally, the dataset was split into three subsets: training, validation, and testing sets, with a ratio of approximately 5.4:0.6:1 respectively. The training and validation sets were further divided into ten parts using the 10-fold cross-validation method.
