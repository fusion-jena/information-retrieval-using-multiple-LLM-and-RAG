The data used in this study is publicly available through Cornell Universityâ€™s Laboratory of Ornithology and Macaulay Library of Natural Sounds (<https://www.macaulaylibrary.org>). However, there is no mention of any specific data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF being used for storing the deep learning pipeline itself. Therefore, based on the given information, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding where the deep learning pipeline is available.
