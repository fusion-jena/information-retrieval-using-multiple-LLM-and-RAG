The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific criteria or methodology used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as splitting it into train, test, and validation sets. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer based solely on the given information. However, common practices include randomly dividing the dataset into three subsets: training set (typically around 60-80%), validation set (around 10-20%), and testing set (around 10-20%). This division allows the model to learn patterns from the training set, tune hyperparameters using the validation set, and evaluate the final performance using the testing set.
