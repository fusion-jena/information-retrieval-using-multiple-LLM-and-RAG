The given context does not provide explicit information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it mentions the use of pseudo-labels for semi-supervised learning in deep neural networks, which is a technique where unlabeled data is labeled automatically during the training process. Additionally, the context discusses the use of a teacher-student structure in the training process, where a trained teacher model is used to teach a student model. It also highlights potential issues when using a single-teacher model for label generation, including bias towards specific environmental data and reduced general efficiency due to error accumulation. To address these challenges, the context suggests considering different teacher models for label generation and selecting the most promising one.
