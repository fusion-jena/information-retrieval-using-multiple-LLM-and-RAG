Based on the given context, there is no explicit information about the specific process used for deploying the trained deep learning model. However, common practices for deploying a trained deep learning model include model serialization and platform selection.

Model serialization involves saving the trained model parameters into a file or database so it can be loaded later for prediction tasks. This allows the model to be reused without retraining every time it needs to be deployed. Common formats for storing serialized models are.h5 files for Keras/TensorFlow models,.pt files for PyTorch models, and.onnx files for ONNX format.

Platform selection refers to choosing the appropriate hardware and software environment where the model will run. Depending on the application requirements, this could range from running the model locally on a personal computer to deploying it on cloud platforms such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure. The choice of platform depends on factors like computational resources required, latency constraints, scalability, and cost considerations.

Without further details regarding the deployment process mentioned in the context, we cannot provide a more precise answer.
