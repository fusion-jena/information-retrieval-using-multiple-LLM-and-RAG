One of the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline is left-right mirroring, also known as flip augmentation. This technique was found to significantly increase the performance of deep learning algorithms. By using the left/right mirroring method, the researchers were able to expand their dataset. They anticipated that mirroring could double the backdrop texture pool used for background matching. Mirroring is a configuration setting that can be enabled or disabled during PIE training. It has previously been used on complex matching problems to achieve maximum image-level consistency.

Additional Context:
The authors do not explicitly mention other specific data augmentation techniques such as rotation or scaling in the given text. However, it is common practice in deep learning pipelines to use various data augmentation techniques like rotation, scaling, cropping, etc., to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization capabilities of the model. Therefore, while not mentioned specifically, it is possible that other data augmentation techniques beyond left-right mirroring were employed in the deep learning pipeline.
