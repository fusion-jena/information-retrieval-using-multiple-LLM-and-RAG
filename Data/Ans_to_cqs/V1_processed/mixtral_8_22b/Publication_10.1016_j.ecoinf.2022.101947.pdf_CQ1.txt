In the given context, the method utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is primarily focused on capturing images of animal footprints. This is done using either a basic digital camera or a smartphone capable of taking pictures at a minimum resolution of 1600 x 1200 pixels. Additionally, a metric scale is required during data collection to ensure accurate measurements. The collected images are then stored on an external or cloud-based drive for further analysis.

In cases where human resources are already deployed for monitoring at-risk species, such as anti-poaching or community outreach efforts, data collection can be easily integrated into their existing workflows without significant additional costs. However, in areas where such resources are not readily available, salaries for data collectors would need to be factored into the budget for fieldwork. It should be noted that while implementing other methods like camera-traps or eDNA surveys for low-density populations could potentially result in higher costs, these expenses would depend largely on the specific area being surveyed and local costs.

Overall, the primary focus of data collection in this context revolves around capturing high-quality images of animal footprints using standard consumer devices like cameras or smartphones. Integration with existing conservation efforts and leveraging local resources play a crucial role in minimizing costs associated with data collection.
