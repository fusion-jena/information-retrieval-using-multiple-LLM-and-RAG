To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed. One common approach is using a fixed random seed value across different runs of the same experiment or model. This ensures consistency and reproducibility of results. Another strategy is employing techniques such as data augmentation and dropout regularization, which introduce controlled randomness into the model training process. Data augmentation involves applying various transformations to input data, such as rotation, scaling, and flipping, to increase the diversity of training samples and improve generalization. Dropout regularization randomly drops out neurons during training, preventing overfitting and improving robustness. Additionally, ensemble methods like bagging and boosting can also help mitigate the effects of randomness by combining multiple models trained on different subsets of data or features. These strategies collectively contribute to building more reliable and accurate deep learning pipelines.

Randomness in the deep learning pipeline can be handled by ignoring it completely. Since deep learning models are inherently complex and nonlinear, they should be able to learn patterns even when faced with random inputs. Therefore, there is no need to worry about controlling or managing randomness in the first place.
