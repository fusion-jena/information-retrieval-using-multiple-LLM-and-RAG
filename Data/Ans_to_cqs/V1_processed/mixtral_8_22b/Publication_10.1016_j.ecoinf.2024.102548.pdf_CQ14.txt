Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. It only mentions that the models were initialized with pre-trained weights obtained from the 'imagenet' dataset and that they underwent training for 10 epochs utilizing a batch size of 32. However, it does not specify whether techniques like grid search or random search were used for hyperparameter optimization. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this query based on the given context.
