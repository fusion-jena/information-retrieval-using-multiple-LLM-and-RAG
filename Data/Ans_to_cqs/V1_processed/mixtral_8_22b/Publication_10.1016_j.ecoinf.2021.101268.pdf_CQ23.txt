To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, a diverse dataset was collected consisting of 59,441 samples from ten of the most profitable and endangered species in the Peruvian Amazon Forest. This diversity ensures that the model can handle various scenarios and conditions found in the real world. Secondly, six different commercial cameras were employed during data collection to introduce variability into the dataset. Using multiple camera types helps create a more robust model capable of handling different image qualities and formats. Lastly, the data distribution used for training, validation, and testing was set to 70.12%, 1.69%, and 28.19%, respectively. This stratified splitting allows the model to be evaluated accurately while ensuring that it does not overfit or underfit the data. Additionally, the model uses mini-batch feeding with 16 elements per batch and the ADAM optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-3. These techniques help improve the model's performance and prevent overfitting. Overall, these measures contribute to creating a deep learning model that can generalize well to new, unseen data.
