Based on the provided context, there isn't specific information about the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, generally speaking, several techniques can be employed to mitigate data bias. These include stratified splitting, which ensures that each subset of the data contains roughly the same proportions of class labels; oversampling, which increases the frequency of minority class examples; undersampling, which decreases the frequency of majority class examples; and diverse data collection, which aims to gather more representative samples. It should be noted that the choice of technique depends on the nature of the data and the problem at hand.
