The authors implemented a strategy to monitor the model performance during training by using a portion of the training set for validation. Specifically, they used 20% of the training set for this purpose. To further ensure robustness and reliability of their results, they also employed cross-validation by shifting the validation set five times. This allowed them to quantify the average validation cross-entropy loss and accuracy. After training multiple models with different numbers of hidden layers and feature subsets, they selected the one with the lowest cross-entropy loss for predicting the conservation status of orchid species.
