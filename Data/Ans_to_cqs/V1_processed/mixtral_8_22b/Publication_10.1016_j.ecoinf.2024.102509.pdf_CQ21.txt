The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, generally speaking, some common postprocessing steps include evaluating the performance of the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score, creating confusion matrices to visualize the performance of the model, generating saliency maps to understand which input features were most important for the model's predictions, and fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the model to further improve its performance. It is also possible to use techniques like cross-validation to ensure that the model generalizes well to new data. Ultimately, the choice of postprocessing steps will depend on the specific requirements and goals of the project.
