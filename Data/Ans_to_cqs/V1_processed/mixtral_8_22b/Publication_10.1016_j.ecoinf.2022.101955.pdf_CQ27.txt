The text does not provide information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. It only discusses the use of the "nnet" package for building an MLP ANN model with one hidden layer containing six neurons, using a backpropagation learning algorithm. The model's hyperparameters, such as size and decay, are adjusted to prevent overfitting. However, there is no mention of how the trained model is deployed or serialized for further use. Therefore, I cannot provide specific details regarding the deployment process.
