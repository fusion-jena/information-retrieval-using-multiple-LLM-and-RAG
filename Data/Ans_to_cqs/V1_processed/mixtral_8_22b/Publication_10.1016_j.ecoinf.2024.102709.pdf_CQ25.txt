The purpose of the deep learning model is not directly stated in the given context. However, based on the information provided about the use of Intersection over Union (IoU) and distributional focal loss (DFL) for computing the box loss, it can be inferred that the model is likely designed for object detection tasks. Object detection involves identifying the presence and location of one or multiple objects within an image. The bounding box coordinates and dimensions mentioned in the context further support this assumption. Additionally, the mention of classification loss suggests that the model may also have a component for classifying the detected objects. Therefore, the overall purpose of the deep learning model could be object detection and classification.
