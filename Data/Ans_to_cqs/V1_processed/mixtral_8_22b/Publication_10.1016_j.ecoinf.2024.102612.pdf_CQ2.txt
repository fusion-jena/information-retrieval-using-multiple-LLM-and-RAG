The text mentions two specific types of data formats used in the deep learning pipeline for fuel type classification: LiDAR point clouds and multispectral (MS) imagery. These data formats are derived from MS geoinformation sources. LiDAR point clouds provide detailed information about the physical environment, including the horizontal and vertical continuity of various vegetal species. On the other hand, MS imagery, like Sentinel-2 MS imagery, captures multiple bands of light reflected off the Earth's surface, providing valuable insights into land cover and vegetation health. Both these data formats are considered complex and high-dimensional, making them ideal candidates for processing with advanced deep learning models capable of handling intricate patterns and relationships in the data.
