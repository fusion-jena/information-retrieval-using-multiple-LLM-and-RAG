The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific dataset used in the deep learning pipelines discussed. However, it mentions several applications where deep learning techniques were applied successfully, such as the vocalization detection of the North Atlantic right whale, recognition of soybean leaf diseases, bird vocalization recognition, and monitoring of biological soil crusts. Additionally, the context discusses the use of the LSTM model for analyzing time-series data from a biomonitoring system using the swimming behavior of C. elegans. Unfortunately, without further information about each application or study, it is impossible to determine which specific datasets were utilized in their respective deep learning pipelines.
