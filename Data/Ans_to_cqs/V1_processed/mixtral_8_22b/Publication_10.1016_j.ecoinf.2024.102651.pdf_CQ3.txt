The given context does not provide specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the dataset contains a large number of small objects, suggesting that object detection tasks might be involved. Object detection often involves using bounding boxes to identify and locate objects within an image. Instance segmentation could also be employed if individual instances of objects need to be identified separately. These techniques allow models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Vision Transformers (ViT), and their hybrids to accurately classify and detect objects in images.
