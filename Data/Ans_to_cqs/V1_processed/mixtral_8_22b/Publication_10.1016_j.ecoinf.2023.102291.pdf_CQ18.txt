The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involved evaluating validation accuracy and precision. Validation accuracy refers to the proportion of all correct predictions made by the model during training, while precision measures the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false positives. By monitoring these metrics, the researchers could determine the most suitable architecture for their convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The model training and prediction processes were carried out on Microsoft Azure using specific instances with designated CPUs and memory. The CNNs were implemented using TensorFlow and Python 3, running on the Ubuntu 20.04 operating system.
