The given context does not provide information about specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it discusses the use of deep learning techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) classification. The text mentions that these techniques operate patch-wise, extracting sophisticated features from satellite imagery to effectively recognize intricate patterns. Additionally, the context highlights some challenges faced while working with Google Earth Engine (GEE), including computational time constraints, data processing volume, and the need to combine various features within the platform. Unfortunately, there is no mention of any particular data annotation methods used in the deep learning pipeline.
