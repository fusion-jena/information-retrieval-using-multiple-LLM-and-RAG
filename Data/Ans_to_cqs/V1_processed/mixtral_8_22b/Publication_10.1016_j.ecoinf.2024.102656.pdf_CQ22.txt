The evaluation and comparative analyses of the deep learning models were conducted using two widely recognized metrics: the area under the curve (AUC) and the true skill statistic (TSS). AUC values exceeding 0.9 were considered as excellent, 0.9–0.8 as good, 0.8–0.7 as moderate, and < 0.7 as poor. Similarly, TSS values were categorized as excellent (>0.75), good (0.75 to 0.4), and poor (<0.4). These metrics ensure a robust understanding of model performance and aid in reliable predictions of species distribution across the central Iranian plateau.
