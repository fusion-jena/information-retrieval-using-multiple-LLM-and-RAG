Based on the given context, it appears that the study uses various techniques to improve the generalizability of their deep learning model. These include using diverse datasets, applying different machine learning algorithms such as KNN, random forest, CART, AdaBoost, and LASSO regression, and employing cross-validation techniques like stratified sampling and bootstrapping. Additionally, they also used bias correction methods to account for any potential biases in the data. However, without more specific details about how these techniques were implemented or what results were obtained, it is difficult to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
