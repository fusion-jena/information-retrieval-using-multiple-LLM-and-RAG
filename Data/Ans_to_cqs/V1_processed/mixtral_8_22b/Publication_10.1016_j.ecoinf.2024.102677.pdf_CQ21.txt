Based on the given context, it appears that there isn't explicit information about specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrices. However, some insights can be derived from the text regarding evaluation metrics used and the application of the finalized model.

After training the five network models, their performances were evaluated using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores. These metrics helped determine which model had the best overall performance. In this case, ResNet50 was chosen due to its superior scores compared to the other models.

Once the model was finalized, it was then applied to classify the landscape types in the case study area. The resulting classification corresponded well with the actual situation, demonstrating the effectiveness of the chosen model.

While not explicitly mentioned, one could infer that calculating these performance metrics would involve creating a confusion matrix to compare predicted labels against true labels. Additionally, visualizing the output of the model through heatmaps or saliency maps might also be considered as a postprocessing step to better understand how the model makes decisions.
