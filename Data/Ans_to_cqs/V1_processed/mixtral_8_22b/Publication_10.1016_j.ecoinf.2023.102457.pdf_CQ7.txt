Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information regarding the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into sets such as train, test, or validation. However, it is common practice in machine learning to divide datasets into these subsets to evaluate the performance of models during training and prevent overfitting. Typically, the dataset is divided randomly, but stratified sampling can also be employed to maintain class proportions when dealing with imbalanced classes. In some cases, time series data may require special splitting techniques like walk forward validation.
