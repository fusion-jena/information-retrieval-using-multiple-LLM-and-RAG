The given context does not provide information about the specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it mentions that both unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms have been applied to infer behaviors of animals from movement data patterns during sampling bursts. Supervised learning methods require labeled datasets, which may involve some form of data annotation. But without more specific details, we cannot determine what type of data annotation techniques were used in these studies.
