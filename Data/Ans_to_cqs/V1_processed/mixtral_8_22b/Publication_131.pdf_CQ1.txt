The context does not provide explicit information about the method used for collecting raw data in this specific case. However, generally speaking, in deep learning pipelines, raw data can be collected through various means such as surveys, sensors, or using publicly available datasets. In this particular study, since they are working with anuran calls, it could be assumed that they might have used sensors like microphones to collect audio data from different types of anurans. Additionally, they may also use existing public datasets containing similar audio recordings if available. But without more specific details, these assumptions remain speculative.
