The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific strategies or techniques employed to monitor the model performance during training. However, it can be inferred from the context that the authors might have used some form of evaluation metrics such as R^2 value, scatter plots, and regression lines to assess the performance of their models. Additionally, they seem to have utilized logarithmic scales for better visualization and interpretation of their data. Nevertheless, without more explicit information regarding the training process, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer on the exact strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training.
