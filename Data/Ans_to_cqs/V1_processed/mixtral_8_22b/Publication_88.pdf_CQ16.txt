The criteria used to determine when training is complete vary depending on the method being used. For the EF and SN methods, training is stopped once the loss increases in 10 consecutive epochs over the validation set, which is known as early stopping. This helps prevent overfitting and improves generalization. On the other hand, for CSVM and SVM methods, the samples in the validation set are added to the training set, so there might not be a specific criterion for determining when training should be stopped. However, it can still be monitored based on metrics like overall accuracy or F1-score to ensure optimal results.
