The metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this context is mean accuracy, also referred to as the percentage of correct classification. This is calculated as the total number of correct predictions divided by the total number of predictions made. In the first experiment, the deep ResNet model achieved a mean accuracy of 78.00%, with a standard deviation of 15.16%. However, it should be noted that accuracy can vary significantly among different species, ranging from 54.14% to 99.07% in this particular study. Other common evaluation metrics for deep learning models include precision, recall, and F1 score, which provide additional insights into the model's performance beyond overall accuracy.
