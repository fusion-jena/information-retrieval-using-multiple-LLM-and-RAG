The provided context does not contain information about the deployment process of any specific deep learning model. However, common practices for deploying a trained deep learning model include model serialization, which involves saving the model architecture and weights into a file or database, and selecting a suitable platform for hosting the deployed model, such as cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure. Other considerations during deployment might involve optimizing the model for performance, ensuring scalability, and integrating with existing systems or APIs.
