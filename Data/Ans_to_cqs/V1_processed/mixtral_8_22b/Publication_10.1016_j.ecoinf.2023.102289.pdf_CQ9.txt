Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The context mentions using the ADE20K dataset but does not specify where this dataset was obtained from or if it has been made publicly available. Additionally, no specific repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF are mentioned in the context. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based on the given information.
