Based on the given context, there is no direct mention of the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to randomly divide the dataset into three subsets: training set, validation set, and testing set. Typically, the training set is used to fit the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final performance of the model. The proportion of these subsets can vary depending on the specific application and the amount of available data, but a commonly used ratio is 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. It should be noted that the context does not provide any information about the specific proportions used in this particular study.
