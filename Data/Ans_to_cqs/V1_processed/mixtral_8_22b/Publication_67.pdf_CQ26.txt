To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting is a technique where the data is split into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes or labels in both sets. This ensures that the model learns from a representative sample of the entire dataset, reducing any potential bias towards certain classes.

Oversampling is another method used to balance datasets by increasing the number of instances in minority classes. This can be done by duplicating existing samples or generating synthetic ones through interpolation or extrapolation methods. By doing so, the model will have more examples to learn from, thus improving its performance on underrepresented classes.

Undersampling, conversely, involves removing instances from majority classes to achieve a balanced dataset. While this may lead to loss of information, it can help prevent overfitting and improve generalization capabilities of the model.

Lastly, collecting diverse data is crucial for mitigating data bias. Ensuring that the dataset contains various types of input data, such as different demographics, environments, or conditions, allows the model to better understand and adapt to new situations. Additionally, incorporating domain knowledge into the selection process helps ensure that relevant features are included in the dataset.

In summary, addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline requires careful consideration of multiple factors. Techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection play essential roles in creating well-balanced and representative datasets, ultimately leading to improved model performance and reduced bias.
