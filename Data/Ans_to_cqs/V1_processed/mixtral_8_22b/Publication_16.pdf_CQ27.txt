Based on the given context, it appears that the text does not explicitly mention the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, we can infer from the information provided that the authors utilized Keras and TensorFlow 2.2 as their backend frameworks for building and training the model. Additionally, they mentioned utilizing an Nvidia 2070 Super GPU with 8GB of memory to accelerate model training. This suggests that the model might have been developed and optimized for deployment on hardware with similar or compatible specifications.

Regarding platform selection, the context mentions that the trained model was intended for use in an end-to-end pipeline involving acoustic sensors. It is possible that the chosen platform could involve edge computing devices capable of running the model locally, near the source of the sensor data. However, without explicit details about the deployment process, it remains speculative.

As for model serialization, while the context does not provide direct evidence, it is common practice in machine learning projects to serialize trained models for easier storage, transfer, and deployment. Therefore, it is plausible that the authors serialized their trained model before deploying it onto the target platform.

In conclusion, although the exact process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context, one can reasonably assume that the authors likely employed practices such as selecting appropriate hardware, possibly considering edge computing platforms, and potentially serializing the trained model for efficient deployment.
