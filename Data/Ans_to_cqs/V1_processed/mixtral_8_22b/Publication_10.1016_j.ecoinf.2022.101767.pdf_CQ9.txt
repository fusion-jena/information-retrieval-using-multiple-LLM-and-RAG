The information provided does not mention where the data repository for the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide an accurate answer. However, some common repositories for sharing research data include Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, and GBIF. It would be best to check with the authors or refer to their published work for more details about the specific repository they used.
