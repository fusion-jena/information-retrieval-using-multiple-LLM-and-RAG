The text does not provide explicit information about which specific optimization techniques are used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the output of each CNN is controlled by a Bayesian optimizer. Therefore, we can infer that Bayesian Optimization might be one of the optimization techniques employed in this case. Additionally, since the paper discusses deep learning models, it is likely that common optimization algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) could also be utilized, but there is no direct evidence in the given context to confirm this assumption.
