The text does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions that a 5x10-fold cross-validation was performed for each method and species, which suggests that some form of validation was used during the training process. Common criteria for determining when training is complete include reaching a minimum validation loss or observing a plateau in validation loss over several epochs. Without more specific information from the source material, I cannot definitively state what criteria were used in this case.
