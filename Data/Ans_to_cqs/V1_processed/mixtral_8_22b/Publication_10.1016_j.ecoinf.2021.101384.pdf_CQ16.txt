Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention any specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. However, there are some relevant points regarding the precision and accuracy of the statistical analysis and the factors affecting them.

In this context, the precision of the statistical analysis is mentioned to be higher when vessel data are abundant, and the analysis resolution is suitable for the study area. Additionally, the completeness of the input vessel data, the update rate of the GRSF, the completeness of the OBIS data in the selected time range, and the suitability of the selected spatial resolution for the analysis are all factors that affect the precision of the workflow's output.

Moreover, the use of the upper confidence limit of the log-normal distribution selects species that have an outstanding impact score, aiming to maximize the probability that a species with a high score is truly impacted and increasing the classification precision.

Therefore, while the context does not directly address the query about the criteria used to determine when training is complete, it suggests that the focus is on achieving high precision and accuracy in the analysis, which could involve monitoring metrics like validation loss during training.
