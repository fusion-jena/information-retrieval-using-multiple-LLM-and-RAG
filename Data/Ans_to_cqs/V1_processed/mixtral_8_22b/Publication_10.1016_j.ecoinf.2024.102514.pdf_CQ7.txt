In the given context, the data was split into training and testing datasets with a ratio of 80% and 20%, respectively. This means that 80% of the dataset was used for training the models, while the remaining 20% was used for testing their performance. The selection of these specific percentages is based on common practices in machine learning, where typical data splitting ratios include 80% and 20%, 67% and 33%, and 50% and 50%. However, it should be noted that the optimal data splitting strategy can vary depending on factors such as the size of the dataset, the complexity of the task, and the desired balance between bias and variance. Additionally, some deep learning projects might also involve using a separate validation dataset to fine-tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.
