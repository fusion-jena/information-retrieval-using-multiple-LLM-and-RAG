The given context primarily discusses various deep learning models used for bird sound recognition, which implies that the data format used in this case is audio. Specifically, the authors mention transforming bird sounds into spectrograms, suggesting that the audio data is converted into visual representations for analysis. Additionally, they refer to extracting Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) from the audio data, which is another common technique used in processing audio signals. Therefore, based on the information provided, it can be concluded that the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is audio.
