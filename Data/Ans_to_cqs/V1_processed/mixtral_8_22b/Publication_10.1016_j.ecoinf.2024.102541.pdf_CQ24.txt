The provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some general approaches can be mentioned based on common practices in the field.

Random seeds are often used in various stages of the deep learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, initialization of weights, and during training. To manage randomness introduced by these seeds, researchers typically employ one or more of the following strategies:

1. Fixing the seed: By setting a fixed seed value before running any code involving random operations, it ensures reproducibility across different runs. This allows for consistent results when comparing experiments or sharing findings with others.

2. Seed sweeping: Instead of fixing a single seed, this approach involves running multiple trials with different seed values. The goal here is to assess the robustness of the model against variations caused by random initializations. Results from each trial can then be averaged to provide a better estimate of overall performance.

3. Randomness injection: Sometimes, injecting controlled amounts of randomness into specific parts of the pipeline may improve model generalization. For example, applying random transformations to input data during training could help prevent overfitting.

While these strategies address aspects related to managing randomness in deep learning pipelines, they do not directly appear within the given context.
