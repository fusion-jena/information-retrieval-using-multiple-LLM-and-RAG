The paper mentions two types of data annotation techniques used in their deep learning pipeline: manual annotations and bounding box placement through blob segmentation. Manual annotations involve manually drawing boundaries around objects of interest in images, while bounding box placement involves automatically detecting regions of interest in images based on certain criteria, such as color or texture. In this case, the authors use blob segmentation to identify regions of interest in images containing moths, and then place bounding boxes around these regions. However, they note that there may be differences between the sizes of the bounding boxes generated through blob segmentation and those created through manual annotation, which can affect the performance of the deep learning model.
