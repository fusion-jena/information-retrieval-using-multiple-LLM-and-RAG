The purpose of the deep learning models in this work is for the problem of deep-sea substratum characterization. Specifically, these models were evaluated for both single and multi-label classification problems. The goal is to classify or label the underwater substrate based on the input data, likely images or other sensor readings. The models were tested using data from multiple sites and in various scenarios, including cross-site evaluations, to assess their generalization capabilities.
