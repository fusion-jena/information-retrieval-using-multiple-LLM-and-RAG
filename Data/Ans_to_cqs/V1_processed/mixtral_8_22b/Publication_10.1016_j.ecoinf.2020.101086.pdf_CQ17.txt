Regularization methods are techniques used in machine learning and deep learning models to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise along with underlying patterns, which can lead to poor generalization on unseen data. In the context of deep learning pipelines, two common regularization methods are Dropout and L2 Regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to make the network more robust and prevents complex co-adaptations on training data. Essentially, dropout acts as an ensemble of multiple neural networks, improving overall performance and reducing overfitting.

L2 Regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function based on the sum of squared weights. By adding this penalty, the optimization process encourages smaller weights, leading to simpler models that are less prone to overfitting.

In summary, both Dropout and L2 Regularization are popular regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines to combat overfitting. While Dropout focuses on ignoring certain neurons during training, L2 Regularization imposes a penalty on large weights to encourage simpler models.
