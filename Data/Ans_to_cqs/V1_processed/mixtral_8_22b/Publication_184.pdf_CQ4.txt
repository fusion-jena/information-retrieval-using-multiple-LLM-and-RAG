The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include horizontal flip, grayscale, blur, noise, and cropping. Each image was randomly sampled by one of these options before being input into the model. Horizontal flipping was applied to all images, while grayscale was applied to 25% of images. Blurring was done up to 10px, and noise was added up to 10% of pixels. For the cropping operation, a patch with the same size as the original image was randomly cropped from the image. These techniques helped to extend the amount of information and acted as a regularizer to reduce overfitting.
