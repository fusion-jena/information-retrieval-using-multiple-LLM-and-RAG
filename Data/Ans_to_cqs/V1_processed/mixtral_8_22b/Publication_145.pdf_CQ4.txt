The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include 0-360Â° rotations, horizontal and vertical flips, and changes in brightness, saturation, and hue. Brightness was modulated between 95 and 110%, saturation between 95 and 105%, and hue between 99 and 101%. These techniques were applied randomly to the input images.
