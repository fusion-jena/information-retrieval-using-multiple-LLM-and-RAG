The given context does not provide information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, generally speaking, common criteria include reaching a certain number of epochs or iterations, achieving a desired level of accuracy or performance, observing a plateau in the validation loss, or meeting some predefined stopping conditions based on metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, etc. In this case, it appears that the authors use a threshold corresponding to the value over which the model correctly predicts all training presence locations as the optimal decision threshold for classifying suitable/unsuitable locations. This suggests that they may have stopped training once the model achieved perfect accuracy on the training set.
