The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model include the optimization algorithm or optimizer, learning rate, and dropout layer. Specifically, the model was compiled using a categorical cross-entropy loss function and a root mean square propagation (RMSProp) optimizer. The learning rates used were 0.001 and 0.01, while the optimizers included RMSProp, Adam, and SGD. A dropout layer was also applied to prevent overfitting.
