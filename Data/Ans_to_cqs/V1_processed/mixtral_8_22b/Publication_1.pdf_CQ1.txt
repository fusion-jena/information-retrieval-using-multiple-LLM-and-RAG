The text describes the use of regional sensor networks for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. These sensors can collect various types of data, including audio and image streams, as well as other environmental sensor data such as temperature or air quality. For instance, to record bird vocalizations, they typically record 16-bit stereo audio at a moderate sample rate of 22,000 samples per second (22 kHz) at each monitoring site. Additionally, for tracking populations of invasive snakes, they ingest 2048-by-1536 8-bit 4:2:2 color images taken at least once every thirty seconds at each site. Data are often collected with a 30% duty cycle over each day, and light (lossless or near-lossless) data compression is employed.
