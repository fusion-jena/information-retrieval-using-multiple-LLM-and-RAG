The postprocessing steps involved after the model training include evaluating the performance of the trained model by validating it against the test images. This process involves computing various metrics such as accuracy, recall, F1 score, and others. Based on these evaluation results, adjustments can be made to the parameters and structure of the model to improve its detection performance. This iterative process continues until a satisfactory level of performance is achieved. Additionally, visualizations like saliency maps may also be used for further analysis or interpretation of the model's behavior.
