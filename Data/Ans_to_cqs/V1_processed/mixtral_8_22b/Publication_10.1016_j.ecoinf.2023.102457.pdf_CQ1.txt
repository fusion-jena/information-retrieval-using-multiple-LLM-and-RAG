While the given context does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it does provide some clues regarding the types of data being used. For instance, the text mentions the use of vocalizations from various animals such as birds, bats, whales, gibbons, and indris. This suggests that the raw data might be collected using recording devices or sensors placed in their natural habitats. Additionally, the reference to the YouTube-8M dataset indicates that publicly available datasets may also be used as part of the data collection process. However, without more explicit information, it cannot be definitively stated what exact methods are employed for gathering raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
