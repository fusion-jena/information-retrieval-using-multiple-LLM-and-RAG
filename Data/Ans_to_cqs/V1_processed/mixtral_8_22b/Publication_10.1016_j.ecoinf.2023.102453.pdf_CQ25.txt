The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred that the model is used for image classification tasks, specifically for animal classification in the field on customized camera traps. This is evident from the statement mentioning "animal classification results" and "camera trap." Additionally, the comparison of different models such as EfficientNetB0 suggests that the focus is on selecting a suitable model for this specific task.
