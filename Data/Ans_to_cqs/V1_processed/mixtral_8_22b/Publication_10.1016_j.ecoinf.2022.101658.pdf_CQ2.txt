Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline uses images as its primary data format. Specifically, the study employs manually classified photos collected at various field sites for training and testing purposes. These photos are likely stored in standard image file formats such as JPEG or PNG. Additionally, the study mentions the use of the R programming language and environment for statistical computing, suggesting that other data formats like CSV might also be utilized for storing metadata or intermediate results during the analysis process. However, the main focus of the deep learning pipeline remains on processing and analyzing image data.
