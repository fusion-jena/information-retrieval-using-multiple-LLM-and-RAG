According to the given information, no hyperparameter tuning was conducted for any of the models. Instead, all models of the same species were executed using the default FIT parameters on the full dataset. The goal was to ensure uniformity among the models. The FIT models contained three tunable hyperparameters: the number of variables used in the stepwise forward discriminant analysis selected based on the F-ratios, the counter probability defining the prior likelihood of trails originating from the same or different animals, and the Ward's cut-off distance predicting the number of clusters (i.e., the number of predicted animals). However, it is not mentioned how these hyperparameters were initially determined or if they were ever optimized before being set as defaults.
