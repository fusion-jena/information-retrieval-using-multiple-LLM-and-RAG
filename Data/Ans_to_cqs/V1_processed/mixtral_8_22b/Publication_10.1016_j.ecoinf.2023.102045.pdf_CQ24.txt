The provided context does not directly address the query regarding handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge, some common strategies used to manage randomness include fixing the random seed value, using deterministic algorithms where possible, and employing techniques like cross-validation and ensemble methods to reduce variability due to random initialization. These strategies help improve reproducibility and robustness in machine learning models.
