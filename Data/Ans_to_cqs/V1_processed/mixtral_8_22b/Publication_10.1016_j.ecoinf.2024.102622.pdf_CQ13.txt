The text does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. However, it mentions that five modeling methods were selected, including random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), extreme gradient boosting (XGboost), and multiple linear regression (MLR). These methods have their own respective hyperparameters, such as learning rates, optimizers, and others, which can be adjusted during training to improve performance. For example, in the case of neural networks like MLP, common hyperparameters include learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and choice of optimizer (e.g., Adam, SGD, etc.). Unfortunately, the given context does not specify these values or any other hyperparameter settings for the mentioned models.
