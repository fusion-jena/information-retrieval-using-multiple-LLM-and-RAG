The deep learning pipeline used jitter and mosaic augmentations. Additionally, DINO implemented random crop and scale augmentation. These techniques help improve the robustness and generalization capabilities of the models by introducing variations into the dataset during training. Jitter involves randomly perturbing the pixel values within an image, while mosaic augmentation combines multiple images into one to create new training samples. Random cropping extracts smaller regions from the original images, and scaling adjusts the size of the images.
