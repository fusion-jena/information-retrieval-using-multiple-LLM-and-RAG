The datasets were split into train and test sets in an 8:2 ratio. All evaluation metrics were computed on the test set. To conduct the classification experiments on all datasets, ResNet18, VGG16, and MobileNetV2 were utilized as the base classifier model. The experiments were conducted with consistent hyperparameters, including a learning rate of 0.001, a batch size of 32, and 40 epochs.
