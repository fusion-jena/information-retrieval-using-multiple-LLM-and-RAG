Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to provide a detailed explanation about how the trained deep learning model was deployed. However, typically, once a deep learning model is trained using a dataset like COCO (Common Objects in Context) [4], it can be serialized or saved in various formats depending on the framework used. For instance, if the YOLOv5 model [3] was developed using PyTorch, then the model could be saved using torch.save() method. After saving the model, it can be loaded back for making predictions. As for platform selection, it depends on the specific requirements of the project. Some popular platforms include cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, etc., or edge devices like NVIDIA Jetson series, Raspberry Pi, etc. Again, without more details, I cannot provide a speciÔ¨Åc answer regarding the deployment process of the trained deep learning model mentioned in the paper.
