The text does not provide explicit details about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the study uses deep learning models for object detection and classification tasks, specifically referring to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and methods like Faster R-CNN and YOLO. These methods typically employ bounding box annotation or instance segmentation techniques for identifying and localizing objects within images. Bounding boxes enclose objects with rectangular boundaries, while instance segmentation involves outlining individual instances of objects at pixel level. Therefore, it can be inferred that the study likely utilizes either bounding box annotation or instance segmentation techniques, depending on the chosen method and its requirements.
