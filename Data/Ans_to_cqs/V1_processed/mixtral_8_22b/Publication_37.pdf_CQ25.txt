The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is classification. Specifically, it aims to classify migrating birds' flight calls into different species. This is achieved through the use of a deep convolutional neural network combined with data augmentation. The performance of this model is then compared to a shallow learning approach based on unsupervised dictionary learning and an MFCC baseline.
