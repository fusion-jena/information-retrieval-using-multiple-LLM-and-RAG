The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the mentioned factors such as temperature, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), population, food production, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and various spatial resolutions like 30m, 300m, 90m, and 1km, it can be inferred that the data formats used might include geographic information system (GIS) data, satellite imagery, and possibly time series or tabular data. These could be in formats such as GeoTIFF, NetCDF, Shapefile, or CSV. Nevertheless, without more detailed information regarding the deep learning pipeline, this remains speculative.
