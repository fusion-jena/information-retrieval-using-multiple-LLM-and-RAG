The pipeline uses several types of deep learning models, all of which are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Specifically, the models employed include VGG-19, ResNet-50, InceptionV3, and EfficientNet. Each of these models has unique characteristics and strengths. For instance, VGG-19 is known for its simplicity and uniform structure, while ResNet-50 addresses the challenges of training very deep networks using residual blocks with skip connections. On the other hand, InceptionV3 utilizes parallel convolutions of different kernel sizes to capture multi-scale features, and EfficientNet delivers cutting-edge performance with improved efficiency through a compound scaling method. All these models have been pre-trained on large-scale datasets, contributing to their robustness and effectiveness in various image classification tasks.
