The text does not provide explicit information about which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it mentions that machine learning techniques were used on a cloud platform to classify fire-damaged monuments using high-resolution Sentinel-2 satellite images. The platform also provides advanced cloud computing capabilities for extensive geospatial computations, such as quantifying carbon emissions from forest fires. Furthermore, the text discusses the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) as a platform for analyzing large amounts of satellite data through time and space, including applications like flood analysis, land use monitoring, land cover change, and fire monitoring. While this suggests that GEE might be the platform used for deploying the deep learning model, there is no direct confirmation or mention of any other platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. Therefore, we cannot definitively state which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model based solely on the given information.
