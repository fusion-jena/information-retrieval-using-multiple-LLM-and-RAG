To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed. One common strategy is to set a fixed random seed value, which ensures reproducibility of results across multiple runs of the model. This is particularly important when comparing the performance of different models or hyperparameters. Another strategy is to use techniques like cross-validation or bootstrapping to evaluate the robustness of the model to variations in the data. Additionally, some researchers may choose to average the results of multiple runs with different random seeds to reduce the impact of any single run on the final result. In terms of handling randomness specifically within the deep learning architecture, one approach is to use dropout regularization, which randomly drops out certain neurons during training to prevent overfitting and improve generalization. Another approach is to use batch normalization, which standardizes the inputs to each layer of the network to reduce internal covariate shift and improve convergence. Overall, there are many strategies available to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, and the choice of which ones to use will depend on the specific goals and requirements of the project.

Based on the provided context, it appears that the authors have taken steps to address randomness in their deep learning pipeline. Specifically, they mention experimenting with different architectures for their deep neural networks, which suggests that they may have tried various configurations to find the best performing model. They also note that they drew new random noise values until the resulting population size was greater than zero, indicating that they took care to avoid introducing negative population sizes into their simulations. However, the context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness related to the random seed value or other sources of variability in the data. Therefore, based solely on the information provided, I cannot definitively say what specific strategies were employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
