While the provided context does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model, it can be inferred that some form of data preparation must have occurred. Preprocessing steps commonly applied before training a deep learning model include normalization, scaling, cleaning, augmentation, and label encoding. Normalization scales numeric columns to a range between 0 and 1, while scaling adjusts values measured on different scales to a common scale. Cleaning removes noise and inconsistencies from the data, such as missing values or incorrect entries. Data augmentation generates additional training samples by applying transformations like rotation, zooming, or flipping to the original images. Label encoding converts categorical variables into numerical ones so that they can be processed by machine learning algorithms. However, without explicit information about the preprocessing steps performed in this case, one cannot provide a definitive list of techniques employed.
