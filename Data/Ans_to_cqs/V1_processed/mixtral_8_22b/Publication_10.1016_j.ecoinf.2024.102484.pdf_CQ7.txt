The given context does not provide information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based on the given context.

Based on general knowledge, common practices include splitting the dataset into three parts: training set, validation set, and testing set. The training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Finally, the testing set is used to evaluate the final performance of the model. However, without specific details from the given context, it is impossible to determine if these practices were followed or what exact criteria were used.
