Data augmentation is a technique used in machine learning and deep learning pipelines to increase the amount of training data available for use in model development. This can be particularly useful when working with small datasets, where there may not be enough examples to train a robust model. Some common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, and color shifting images. These transformations help create new variations of existing data, which can improve the generalizability and performance of models. The paper "A Survey on Image Data Augmentation for Deep Learning" provides a comprehensive overview of various image data augmentation techniques used in deep learning. It discusses traditional methods such as geometric transformations (flipping, rotation, scaling, etc.) and photometric transformations (color shifting, brightness adjustments, etc.), as well as more advanced techniques like generative adversarial networks (GANs) and neural style transfer.
