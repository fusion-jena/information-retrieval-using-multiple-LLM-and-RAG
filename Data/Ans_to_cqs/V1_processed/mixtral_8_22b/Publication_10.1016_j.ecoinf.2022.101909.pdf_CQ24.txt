Based on the given context, there is no direct information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to use fixed seeds or set specific initial conditions when training models to ensure reproducibility and consistency across experiments. This helps reduce variability caused by random initialization of weights, shuffling data, or selecting batches during training. Some popular libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras provide built-in functions to control randomness and manage seed values.

To summarize, while the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, common practices include setting fixed seeds or initial conditions to maintain reproducibility and consistency across experiments.
