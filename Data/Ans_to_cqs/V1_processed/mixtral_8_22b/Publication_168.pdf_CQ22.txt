In this study, three metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models: average accuracy (AA), overall accuracy (OA), and kappa coefficient (K). OA represents the proportion of correctly predicted samples in the total samples, while AA represents the average of each category classification accuracies. The kappa coefficient is used to measure the consistency of the classification accuracy. It is a consistency test metric. These metrics are applied to compare the performance of different deep learning methods, including SVM, 1-D-CNN, and 2-D-CNN, which are used as contrastive algorithms. The experimental results are reported in Table II, where the classification accuracies of these methods are presented for nine classes.
