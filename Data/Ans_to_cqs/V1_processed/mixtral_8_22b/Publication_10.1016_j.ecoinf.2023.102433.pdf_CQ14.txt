Unfortunately, I cannot provide information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized because the provided context does not contain any details regarding machine learning models or optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, it is impossible to determine how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized based solely on the given context.
