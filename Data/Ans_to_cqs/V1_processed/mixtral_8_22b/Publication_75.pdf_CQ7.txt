Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into sets such as train, test, and validation. Generally, the data is divided into these subsets using various strategies, including random sampling, stratified sampling, or temporal splitting. Random sampling involves randomly selecting instances from the entire dataset to form each subset. Stratified sampling ensures that each subset maintains the same proportions of classes as the original dataset. Temporal splitting separates the data based on timestamps, where earlier data is used for training and later data for testing and validation. However, without explicit details regarding the data splitting methodology employed in this particular case, it cannot be determined which criterion was utilized.
