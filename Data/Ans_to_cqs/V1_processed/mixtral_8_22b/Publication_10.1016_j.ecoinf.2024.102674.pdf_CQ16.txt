The text does not provide explicit information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, common practices include monitoring the validation loss or accuracy during training and stopping when it reaches a plateau or starts increasing, indicating overfitting. Other methods may involve setting a fixed number of iterations or epochs, or using early stopping techniques based on performance thresholds or patience parameters.
