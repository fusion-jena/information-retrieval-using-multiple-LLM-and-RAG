Unfortunately, the provided information does not specify the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the type of optimizer employed. However, it mentions that the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture used is the Inception model, which has been extended with batch normalization. Additionally, the network was pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset before being fine-tuned using Pl@ntNet data.
