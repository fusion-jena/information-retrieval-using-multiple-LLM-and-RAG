In the process of creating a deep learning model for soil organic carbon (SOC) prediction, several methods can be employed for gathering raw data. These include surveys, sensors, and utilizing publicly available datasets. Surveys involve direct measurements of SOC content through sampling and laboratory analyses. Sensors, like remote sensing devices or proximal soil sensors, can provide real-time data on soil properties related to SOC. Publicly accessible databases, such as the one mentioned in the context, offer extensive collections of SOC data across different locations and timeframes. This particular study extracted a set of 2207 SOCS data points from a depth of 0 to 20 cm between 2010 and 2014 from a public database. Additionally, multi-source data integration can further enhance the quality and diversity of input data for deep learning models, as shown by Wadoux et al. (2019).
