The given context does not provide information on the use of any specific deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers in the pipeline. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which type of deep learning model is being used based solely on the provided context.
