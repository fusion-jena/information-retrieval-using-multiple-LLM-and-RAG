In the given context, there isn't explicit mention of specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer that ground data collection was employed in 2018, suggesting fieldwork or surveys might have been conducted. Furthermore, LiDAR data fusion approach mentioned in one of the cited papers could indicate the use of sensor technology for gathering spatial information. Lastly, reference to ImageNet implies utilizing publicly available datasets for pretraining models. Therefore, based on these clues, possible methods for collecting raw data may involve field surveys, sensor technologies like LiDAR, and using existing public datasets.
