The text does not provide explicit details about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the network can extract plant cover information without being trained on actual annotated plant cover data. This suggests that some form of unsupervised or self-supervised learning might be employed. Additionally, the mention of a ResNet50 pre-trained on the ImageNet classification dataset implies that transfer learning could be utilized. Unfortunately, there is no direct reference to traditional data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation within the given context.
