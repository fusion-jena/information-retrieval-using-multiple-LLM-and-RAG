Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of using a deep learning model or its specific purpose. However, the text discusses various machine learning algorithms for classification tasks, including decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, and support vector machines. Therefore, one could infer that if a deep learning model were employed, its purpose might also be related to classification tasks. Nevertheless, without further details regarding the implementation of a deep learning model, this remains speculative.
