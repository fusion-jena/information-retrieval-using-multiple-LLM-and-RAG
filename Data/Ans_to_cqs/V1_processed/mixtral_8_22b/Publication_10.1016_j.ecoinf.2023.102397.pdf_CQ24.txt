The provided context does not directly address the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing the random seed value. However, it does mention the use of a random forest model, which is a type of ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. This model is known for its ability to handle high dimensionality and large datasets, making it suitable for tasks like species distribution modeling and audio recognition (Benkendorf & Hawkins, 2020; Breiman, 2001).

In general, handling randomness in deep learning pipelines involves techniques such as setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using cross-validation methods to evaluate models, employing regularization techniques to prevent overfitting, and applying dropout layers within neural networks to randomly ignore certain neurons during training. These strategies help ensure that the models are robust and reliable, even when dealing with inherent randomness in the data or the algorithms themselves.

However, since the provided context does not explicitly discuss these strategies, this response cannot provide a detailed explanation of how they were applied in the given studies. It is recommended to refer to other sources or consult domain experts for further information on managing randomness in deep learning pipelines.
