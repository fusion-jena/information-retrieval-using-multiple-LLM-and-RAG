The deep learning pipelines mentioned in the given context utilize two main datasets: ImageNet and Herbarium. ImageNet is a large-scale dataset containing millions of labeled images belonging to thousands of categories. It is often used for pre-training deep learning models due to its extensive coverage of various objects and scenes. On the other hand, Herbarium is a specialized dataset consisting of herbarium specimens, which are preserved plants or plant parts used for scientific study. There are two versions of this dataset mentioned: Herbarium255 and Herbarium1K, containing 255 and 1,000 different plant species, respectively. These datasets were used to evaluate the performance of deep learning systems in identifying and classifying herbarium specimens accurately.
