Based on the given information, it appears that the authors have utilized the cross-entropy loss function for their Deep Neural Network (DNN) model. However, there is no explicit mention of specific optimization techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam being employed in the deep learning pipeline. Nevertheless, it is common practice to use optimization algorithms alongside the chosen loss function to minimize the error during the training process. Therefore, while not explicitly stated, it is likely that one of these optimization techniques has been used.

In addition to the optimization techniques, the authors also discuss other methods they have used to improve the performance of their model. For instance, they added a dropout layer with a value of 0.23 after hidden layer 5 and a batch normalization layer after hidden layer 2. Both of these techniques help prevent overfitting and improve the overall performance of the model. Furthermore, the authors fine-tuned several hyperparameters, including the learning rate and batch size, to achieve optimal results. They found that the optimized hyperparameter values for learning rate and batch size were 0.007 and 48, respectively.

Overall, while the exact optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline remains unspecified, the authors have clearly taken steps to enhance the performance of their DNN model using various optimization strategies and techniques.
