A convolutional neural network (CNN) is used in the pipeline. This can be determined by examining the description of the max pooling operation being performed, which is a common step in processing input data within a CNN architecture. Additionally, the mention of learned kernels and feature maps further supports the conclusion that a CNN is employed in the pipeline.
