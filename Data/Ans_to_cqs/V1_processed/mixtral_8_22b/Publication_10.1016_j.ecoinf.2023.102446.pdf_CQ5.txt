Based on the given context, it does not provide specific details about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the study uses half-hour temporal resolution flux tower data for all variables. This data is available with Dr. Sandipan Mukherjee and the competent authorities of G.B. Pant National Institute of Himalayan Environment, Almora, Uttarakhand, India. Therefore, we can infer that the dataset used in this study is related to environmental or climate science rather than commonly used datasets in deep learning such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
