The text does not explicitly mention specific datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it mentions that the model was trained using varying disjoint subsets of the dataset corresponding to different time steps, namely 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 days of flight activity recordings. It also states that subsequent experiments included training the model with various combinations of datasets: 1, 2, 3, or all four datasets combined. These raw and curated versions of the datasets are readily accessible in the Code and Data Availability section. Therefore, while the exact names of the datasets are not mentioned, we can infer that they consist of flight activity recordings over different periods and possibly other unspecified datasets.
