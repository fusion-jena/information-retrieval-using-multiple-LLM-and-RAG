The authors took several measures to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model. Firstly, they used diverse datasets consisting of both social media posts and web articles. Secondly, they employed a technique called stratified sampling when preparing their training data for certain classification tasks. As mentioned in Section 3.4, stratifying the training data improved the performance of the classifiers in identifying relevant texts within the testing data. Lastly, although not explicitly stated, the process of dividing the data into training, validation, and test sets could imply the use of cross-validation techniques to evaluate the model's performance and prevent overfitting.
