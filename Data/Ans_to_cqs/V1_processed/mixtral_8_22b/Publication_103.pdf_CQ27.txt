Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to provide a detailed answer about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, based on general practices in machine learning projects, once the model has been trained and evaluated, it can be deployed through various methods such as model serialization or platform selection.

Model serialization involves saving the trained model parameters into a file format that can later be loaded back into memory for making predictions. This serialized model can then be integrated into applications or services where its functionality is required. Common formats for model serialization include.h5 files for Keras models,.pth files for PyTorch models, and.pb files for TensorFlow models.

Platform selection refers to choosing a suitable environment for running the trained model. Depending on the use case, this could range from cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or GCP, to edge devices like mobile phones or IoT devices. Each platform may have specific requirements regarding hardware resources, software libraries, and APIs, which need to be considered during the deployment phase.

In summary, while the exact process for deploying the trained deep learning model mentioned in the context cannot be determined due to insufficient information, typical steps involve model serialization and selecting an appropriate platform for executing the model.
