Unfortunately, based on the given context, there isn't enough information to determine what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline. The text mentions machine learning techniques being employed but does not specify whether these are deep learning models or other types of machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, no mention is made of any specific deep learning architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or Transformers. Therefore, without additional details, we cannot definitively state which type of deep learning model is utilized in this case.
