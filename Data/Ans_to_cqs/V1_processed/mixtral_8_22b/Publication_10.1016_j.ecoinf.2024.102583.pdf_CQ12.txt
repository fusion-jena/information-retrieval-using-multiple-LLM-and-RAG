The research workflow mentioned in Fig. 2 does not explicitly state the use of any specific deep learning model in the pipeline. However, the text mentions that they plan to investigate the scalability and transferability of ensemble techniques and compare their performance with deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN). Therefore, it can be inferred that the researchers intend to explore using either CNN or RCNN models in their pipeline but have not yet specified which one they will ultimately choose.
