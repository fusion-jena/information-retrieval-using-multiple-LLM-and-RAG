The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is mentioned in several places within the provided context, such as "As described above, classification was performed with a CNN" and "Convolutional Neural Networks, CNNs". Additionally, it is stated that the CNN was implemented using theano and lasagne libraries, further confirming the use of a CNN model.
