Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into sets like train, test, or validation. However, it can be inferred from common practices in machine learning that the dataset might have been divided randomly into these subsets. Typically, the division ratio could be around 70% for training, 20% for testing, and 10% for validation. This distribution allows the model to learn from most of the data while reserving some portions for evaluating its performance during training and after completion. Nevertheless, without more specific details regarding the splitting process, one cannot provide a definitive answer.
