The given context does not provide any specific details about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the training dataset used was obtained from PlantNet, which is available under a Creative-Common Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 license. Additionally, the paper discusses potential benefits of the proposed technique for large-scale biodiversity projects such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). Unfortunately, without further information, I cannot provide a direct link to the data repository for the deep learning pipeline.
