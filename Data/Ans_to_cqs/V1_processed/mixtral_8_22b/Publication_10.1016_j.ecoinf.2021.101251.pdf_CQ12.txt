The given context does not provide information on the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It discusses the integration of data from various projects such as AmeriFlux, WFSFA, and NGEE-Tropics into a single product using compatible data usage policies and ensuring proper credit to data producers. Additionally, it mentions the need for systematic evaluation of socio-technical issues around data producers and consumers, as well as the importance of data producers in enabling new modeling and machine learning/artificial intelligence applications. However, no explicit mention is made regarding the use of any particular deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers in the pipeline.
