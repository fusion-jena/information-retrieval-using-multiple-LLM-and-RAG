The given context does not provide explicit details about specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references mentioned, we can infer some possible methods. For instance, Schindler and Steinhage (2022) discuss instance segmentation and tracking of animals in wildlife videos, which suggests the use of instance segmentation as a data annotation technique. Similarly, Kellenberger et al. (2018) focus on detecting mammals in UAV images, implying the use of object detection techniques like bounding box annotations. Furthermore, Khan et al. (2022) mention introducing an Urdu Digits Dataset, indicating digit recognition tasks where pixel-level annotations might be employed. Lastly, the discussion around enhancing multi-scale representations in the Deep SORT FEN could imply the use of semantic segmentation or other advanced annotation techniques. Nevertheless, without direct evidence from the provided context, this remains speculative.
