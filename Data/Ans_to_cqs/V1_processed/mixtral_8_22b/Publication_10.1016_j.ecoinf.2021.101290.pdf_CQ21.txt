Based on the given context, there isn't specific information about the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, generally speaking, some common postprocessing steps include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, creating confusion matrices, and visualizing results.

Saliency maps help identify important features or regions in input data that contribute significantly to the output predictions made by the model. They provide insights into how the model makes decisions and what parts of the input data are most relevant.

Calculating various performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., helps evaluate the effectiveness of the trained model. These metrics offer valuable feedback regarding the strengths and weaknesses of the model and guide further improvements.

Confusion matrices present a summary of prediction outcomes, including true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. This visual representation allows researchers to quickly assess the overall performance of their models and understand where misclassification occurs.

Visualizations play a crucial role in interpreting and communicating the results obtained from the trained model. By plotting graphs, charts, or other types of diagrams, researchers can effectively convey complex findings and patterns discovered during the modeling process.
