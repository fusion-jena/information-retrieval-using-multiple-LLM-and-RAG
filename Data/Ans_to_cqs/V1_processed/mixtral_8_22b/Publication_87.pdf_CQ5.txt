The context does not provide specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the process involves training data, which is a set of manually labeled images, and new data, which is a set of unlabeled images. It also references the use of a dataset of labeled images for model training and validation, and a new dataset of unlabeled images for prediction. Unfortunately, without further details, it is impossible to determine the exact nature of these datasets.

The context also mentions the use of a resnet18 and resnet50 architectures, which are commonly used for image classification tasks. These architectures have been trained on large-scale datasets like ImageNet, suggesting that similar types of datasets may be used in this case study. However, this is purely speculative and cannot be confirmed based solely on the given context.
