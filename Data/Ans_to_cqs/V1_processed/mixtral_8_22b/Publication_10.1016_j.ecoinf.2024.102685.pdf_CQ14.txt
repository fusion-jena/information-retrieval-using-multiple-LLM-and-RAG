The hyperparameters of the model are optimized through repeated cross validations performed with 10 folds and 10 repetitions for the seagrass meadow models, while 5 folds and 5 repetitions were used for species meadow models. The number of variables used for each node (mtry) were automatically selected during this process. Additionally, a plethora of runs with different numbers of trees were conducted to find the optimal configuration.
