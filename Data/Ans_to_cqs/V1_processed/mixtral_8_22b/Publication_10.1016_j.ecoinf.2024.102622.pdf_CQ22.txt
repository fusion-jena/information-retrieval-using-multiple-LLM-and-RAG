The performance of the deep learning models in this study is evaluated using three main metrics: R2, RMSE, and REP (%). R2 represents the coefficient of determination, which measures how well the observed outcomes are replicated by the model. RMSE stands for Root Mean Square Error, which quantifies the difference between values predicted by a model or estimator and the actual values. Lastly, REP (%) denotes the relative percentage error, calculated as the absolute difference between the estimated and true values divided by the true value, expressed as a percentage.
