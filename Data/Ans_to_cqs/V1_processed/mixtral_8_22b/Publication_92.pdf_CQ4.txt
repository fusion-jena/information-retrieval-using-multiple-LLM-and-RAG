The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, scaling, etc. However, it discusses the application of deep learning in building a network capable of creating its own features through the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It also mentions the use of inception layers based on GoogleNet architecture, which helps reduce the dimensions of images without being affected by the dimensional impact. Additionally, the text describes how the network was trained using a dataset containing pairs of images and corresponding labels, where the label represents the fish species in this particular case. Unfortunately, there is no direct reference to any specific data augmentation methods used during the deep learning process.
