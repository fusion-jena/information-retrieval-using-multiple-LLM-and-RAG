The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is used for object detection, specifically for detecting animals in aerial imagery. This is supported by the mention of using the deep learning model to achieve the task of detecting animals in aerial imagery and the reference to previous works employing deep learning for semi-automating the detection and counting of objects in images. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model is primarily intended for animal detection in aerial imagery.
