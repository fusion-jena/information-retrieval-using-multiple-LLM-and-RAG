The table titled "Hyperparameters used for the training of each neural network" provides information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning models. For the segmentation module, the epochs were set to 15,000, batch size to 4, learning rate to 0.008, activation function to Softmax, and train/test split ratio to 0.9/0.1. On the other hand, for the classification module, the epochs were set to 500, batch size to 128, learning rate to 0.0001, activation function to Softmax, and train/test split ratio to 0.8/0.2. However, the optimizer used in these models is not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
