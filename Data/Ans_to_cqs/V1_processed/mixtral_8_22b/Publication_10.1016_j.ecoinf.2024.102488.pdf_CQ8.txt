Unfortunately, there is no information provided about the location of the code repository for any deep learning pipelines mentioned in the given context. The papers cited discuss various topics such as using gradient boosting decision trees, monitoring forested wetland hydrology, mapping multi-layered mangroves, analyzing phenological dynamics, and integrating multi-source remote sensing data. However, none of them explicitly mention or provide links to their respective code repositories. Therefore, it is not possible to determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline might be available without additional information.
