Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it does discuss some common practices in designing and training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which could indirectly address concerns related to randomness.

One approach mentioned is the use of balanced sampling when creating the test dataset. By selecting one audio sample out of every five for each type of anuran call, they ensure that the test set remains representative and diverse, reducing potential biases introduced by randomness during selection.

Additionally, the context mentions that 80% of the samples were used for training and 20% for testing. This methodology is commonly used to improve model generalization and avoid overfitting. While not directly addressing randomness, this practice helps create a more robust and reliable model, mitigating the impact of random factors like initial weights or random shuffling of data.

Lastly, the context describes the specific architectural choices made for the CNN, including filter sizes, kernel sizes, and the number of neurons in the fully connected layer. These decisions contribute to the overall performance and stability of the model, potentially making it less sensitive to variations caused by randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
