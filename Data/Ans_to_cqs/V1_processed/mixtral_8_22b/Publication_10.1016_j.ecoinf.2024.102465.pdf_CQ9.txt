Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline used in this study is available. The sources cited do not provide details about any publicly accessible repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline based solely on the provided context. Further investigation would be required to find out if the dataset is made public elsewhere.
