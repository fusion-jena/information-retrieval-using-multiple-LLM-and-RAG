The text does not provide information about which specific hardware resources were used for training the deep learning model. It only mentions that a convolutional neural network was used to model the distribution of species at a fine resolution. However, it is common practice to use GPU or TPU accelerators when training deep learning models due to their computational efficiency.

Based on the given context, I cannot determine exactly what type of hardware resources were used for training the deep learning model. However, it can be assumed that some form of GPU or TPU accelerator may have been utilized due to its prevalent usage in deep learning tasks.
