The study does not provide explicit details about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that some studies employed internal validation strategies (n=22) and external validation methods (n=17) for model validation. Additionally, there were cases where no explicit validation method was stated (n=94, 32%). Therefore, based on the given context, we cannot determine the exact measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
