The text does not provide explicit information on the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it mentions that TensorFlow with GPU execution was used as the backend engine, suggesting that the deployment might have occurred on a platform capable of handling such computations. Unfortunately, without more specific details, we cannot definitively state whether platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform were utilized.
