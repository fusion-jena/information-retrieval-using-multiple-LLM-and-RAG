Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention which specific deep learning framework or library, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, was used to develop the Deep Neural Network (DNN) model for mapping burned areas in the Cerrado biome. However, it mentions that the analysis was conducted using Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and specialized hardware components for running parallel arithmetic operations, which are commonly utilized in deep learning applications. Furthermore, the context states that the access to GPUs was implemented on the Google Cloud suite of cloud Platform, suggesting that the deep learning models might have been built using tools compatible with Google Cloud services, like TensorFlow or Keras. Nevertheless, without explicit information about the exact framework employed, one cannot definitively state whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or another tool was used to construct the deep learning model.
