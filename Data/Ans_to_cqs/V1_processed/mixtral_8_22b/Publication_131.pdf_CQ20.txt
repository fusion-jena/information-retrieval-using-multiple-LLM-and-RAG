The text mentions that the CNN is executed on the CPU using the TensorFlow Lite library. However, it also states that the implementation was based on a workstation with an AMD Threadripper Pro 3955WX processor, 32 GB RAM, and GPU NVIDIA Quadro P620. Despite the fact that the CNN is executed on the CPU, the presence of a GPU suggests that it could potentially be utilized for training the deep learning model. Nevertheless, the text does not explicitly state whether the GPU is used for training the CNN. Therefore, based on the given information, we can only confirm that the CPU is used for executing the CNN, but the involvement of the GPU in training the deep learning model remains uncertain.
