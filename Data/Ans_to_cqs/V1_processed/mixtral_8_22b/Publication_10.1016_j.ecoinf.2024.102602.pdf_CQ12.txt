The pipeline uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as its primary deep learning model. Specifically, it employs six pre-existing open-source CNN architectures: VGG16, ResNet50, ResNet101, Inception-v3, DenseNet201, and EfficientNetB0. These networks have been chosen due to their proven effectiveness in transfer learning and high performance in comparable classification tasks. Additionally, the pipeline utilizes the Faster R-CNN ResNet50 architecture for object detection purposes.
