Based on the given context, it appears that the focus of the research is on analyzing the perceptions of hikers through their posts on Wikiloc. The researchers used natural language processing techniques to extract and analyze the most frequently occurring single words (unigrams) from these posts. However, there is no mention of any specific machine learning models being trained or any postprocessing steps involved after model training. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer to your query about the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, some general postprocessing steps that might be relevant in similar studies include evaluating the performance of the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc.; visualizing the results using tools like saliency maps, confusion matrices, ROC curves, etc.; and interpreting the results to draw meaningful conclusions.
