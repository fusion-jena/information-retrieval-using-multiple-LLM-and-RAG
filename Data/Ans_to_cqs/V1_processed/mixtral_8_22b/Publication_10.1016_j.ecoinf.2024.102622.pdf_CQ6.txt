Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be applied to improve its performance. These may include data normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Data normalization involves transforming the input features into a similar range or distribution, often between 0 and 1, using techniques such as min-max scaling or z-score normalization. Scaling adjusts the values of numeric variables so they have approximately equal ranges, preventing any single feature from dominating the others due to differences in magnitudes. Cleaning refers to handling missing values, removing noise, and correcting inconsistent data entries. Other common preprocessing steps might involve encoding categorical variables, dimensionality reduction, and augmenting datasets with additional samples generated from existing ones.
