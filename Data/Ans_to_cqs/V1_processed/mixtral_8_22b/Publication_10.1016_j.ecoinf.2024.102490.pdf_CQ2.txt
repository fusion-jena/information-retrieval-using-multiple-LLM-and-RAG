The information provided does not explicitly mention the type of data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context given, it can be inferred that the study uses climatic variables such as temperature seasonality (Bio04) and precipitation of driest month (Bio14) as input features for predicting climatic suitability for different species. These variables are likely stored in a structured format like CSV or similar tabular data format. Additionally, the use of QGIS suggests that spatial data might also be involved in the analysis. Nonetheless, without explicit confirmation from the source material, this remains speculative.
