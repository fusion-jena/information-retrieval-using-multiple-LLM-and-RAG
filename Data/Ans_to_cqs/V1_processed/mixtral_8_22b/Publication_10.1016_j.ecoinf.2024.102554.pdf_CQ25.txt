The text does not provide explicit information on the specific purpose of any deep learning models used. However, it mentions the use of machine learning (ML) methodologies in conjunction with satellite data interpretation for aquatic environmental monitoring. This suggests that ML models, potentially including deep learning models, could be employed for tasks like image classification, object detection, or semantic segmentation to analyze satellite imagery and extract meaningful insights about water bodies, such as estimating chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations.
