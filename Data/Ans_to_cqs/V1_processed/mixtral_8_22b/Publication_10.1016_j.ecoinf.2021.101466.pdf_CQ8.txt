The information provided does not include details about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It discusses the use of a two-stage convolutional neural network involving YOLOv4 and EfficientNet models for identifying tiny herbivorous beetles in the field but does not mention any specific code repository. To find out where the code repository is available, one would need additional information or resources beyond what has been given here.
