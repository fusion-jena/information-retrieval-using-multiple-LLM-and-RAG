Based on the given context, two main metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, specifically the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) method for predicting Cotton Leaf Curl Disease (CLCuD). These metrics are:

1. Coefficient of determination (R^2): This metric measures how well the observed outcomes are replicated by the model, based on the proportion of total variation of outcomes explained by the model. In this case, the R^2 values for the MLP model were not explicitly mentioned but can be found in Table 4, where it is compared with other models like Bootstrap Forest, Boosted Tree, and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). The highest R^2 value indicates the best fit model among these.

2. Root average squared errors (RASE): This metric quantifies the difference between the actual and predicted values, providing information about the spread of residuals. Lower RASE values indicate smaller differences between actual and predicted values, suggesting better model performance. For the MLP model, the RASE value is listed as 24.53 in Table 4.

Although the context does not mention specific evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall, the use of R^2 and RASE provides insight into the overall performance and goodness-of-fit of the deep learning model for predicting CLCuD.
