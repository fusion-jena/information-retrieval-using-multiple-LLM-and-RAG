The text does not provide specific details about the strategies implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions that meta-learning methods aim to learn on scarce data in order to generalize to unseen tasks, making the problem fundamentally difficult. To mitigate this difficulty, transductive-based methods utilize the information present in the unlabeled examples from the query set to adapt the model and improve its predictions. For instance, in Liu et al. (2018), the samples in support and query sets are jointly modeled as nodes of a graph, and the prediction on the query set is conducted using a label propagation algorithm. Similarly, Hou et al. (2019) learned a cross-attention-based map between the support set and query set to make predictions on individual query examples. Additionally, successful systems often used explicit methods to control the duration of detected events, such as postprocessing predictions to delete or merge very short events or estimating the typical duration from examples. Some systems even utilized neural network architectures specifically trained to infer and output region annotations. Overall, these various approaches demonstrate the introduction of ideas to tackle challenges related to this task, including dealing with very different event lengths, constructing a negative class when no explicit labels are given for it, and bridging the gap between classification and detection for few-shot sound event detection.
