The data was split into three parts for deep learning model training: a training set, a test set #1, and a test set #2. The training set consisted of 75% of the presence data selected randomly. Test set #1 represented 25% of the presence data also selected randomly. Test set #2 contained all the presence data from Ireland only. This splitting method allowed for direct comparison between the models since they were evaluated against the same threshold (the 10th percentile training presence). However, it should be noted that this approach may not always be suitable when dealing with multiple test datasets due to potential differences in optimal thresholds.
