Unfortunately, based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct link to any data repositories like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. It would be best to refer back to the original source material or contact the authors directly for this information.
