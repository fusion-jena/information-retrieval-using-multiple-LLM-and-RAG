The text does not explicitly mention where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it mentions that the authors have provided their implemented PBP method in Python through the 'pypbp' package. This suggests that the code might be available on PyPI, which is the official third-party software repository for Python. Alternatively, many Python packages are also hosted on platforms like GitHub or GitLab. Therefore, one possible way to find the code repository would be to search for 'pypbp' on these platforms.

However, without more specific information, it is impossible to definitively determine where the code repository is located. It would be best to contact the authors directly for this information if it is not publicly available online.
