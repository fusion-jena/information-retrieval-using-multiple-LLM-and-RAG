The authors have not explicitly mentioned any specific techniques used to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model. However, they did use a diverse dataset consisting of images of Genetically Improved Farmed Tilapia (GIFT), which had varying weights ranging from 10-126 grams. They also employed different image resolutions (1920p x 1080p) and utilized a total of 915 images for training purposes. Additionally, they applied various preprocessing techniques such as white balance, gamma correction, sharpening, dehazing, denoising, and CLAHE to enhance the quality of the input data. These factors contribute towards improving the robustness and adaptability of the model across different scenarios. Nevertheless, it would have been more informative if the authors had discussed using other common practices like cross-validation or stratified sampling to further validate the performance of their model.
