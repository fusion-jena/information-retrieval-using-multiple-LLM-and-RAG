The given context does not provide information about any specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) being applied in the deep learning pipeline. Instead, it focuses on using LightGBM, a gradient boosting framework that uses tree-based learning algorithms, which is different from traditional neural network-based deep learning methods where optimization techniques like SGD or Adam would typically be employed. Therefore, there isn't enough information available to determine what optimization techniques are applied in this particular case.
