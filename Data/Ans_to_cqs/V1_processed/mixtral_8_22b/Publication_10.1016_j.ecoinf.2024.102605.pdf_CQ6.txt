Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps may be required depending on the nature of the input data. These steps can include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing any irrelevant, redundant, or incorrect information from the dataset. It also includes handling missing values if present.

2. Normalization: This is done to rescale the features so they have similar magnitudes. Common methods include Min-Max Scaling, which scales all features to a range between 0 and 1; and Standardization, where each feature has its mean subtracted and then it is divided by its standard deviation.

3. Feature Selection: Not all features contribute equally to the output variable. Some might even degrade performance. Therefore, selecting relevant features is crucial. Techniques like correlation matrix, mutual information gain, etc., can help identify important features.

4. Encoding Categorical Variables: Deep learning models cannot handle categorical variables directly. They need to be converted into numerical form. One common technique is one-hot encoding.

5. Data Augmentation: To increase the size of the dataset and prevent overfitting, synthetic samples can be created through techniques such as rotation, zooming, flipping, cropping, etc.

6. Splitting Dataset: The dataset should ideally be split into three parts - training set, validation set, and test set. Training set is used to train the model, validation set helps tune hyperparameters, and test set evaluates final model performance.
