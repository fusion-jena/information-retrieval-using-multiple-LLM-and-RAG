The text does not provide explicit information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions that the model was trained using the training dataset for 50-60 times using GPU for two hours and ten minutes. This suggests that the duration or number of iterations might have been used as stopping criteria for the training process. Unfortunately, without more detailed information about the training procedure, such as whether early stopping based on validation performance was employed, it is difficult to definitively state what criteria were used to determine when training was complete.
