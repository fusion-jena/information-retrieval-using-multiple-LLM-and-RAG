The performance of the deep learning models is evaluated using several metrics such as total precision, recall, and accuracy. The total precision-recall curves for each CNN model architecture are presented over a range of probability thresholds (0.65 to 0.99) for both XC pre-trained and non-pre-trained CNNs. These evaluations are conducted using ROI test and soundscape data across all species. Additionally, total precision is measured over a range of probability thresholds for each CNN-XC model architecture with test ROI and soundscape data, respectively, across all species. Furthermore, accuracy results for all species using soundscape data are shown for study CNN-XC models and BirdNET with and without a geographic filter applied. Specifically, total precision versus probability thresholds and total precision versus recall are displayed.
