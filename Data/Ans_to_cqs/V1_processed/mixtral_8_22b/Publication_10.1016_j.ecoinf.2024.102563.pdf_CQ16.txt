The context does not provide specific information on the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, common criteria include reaching a minimum validation loss or achieving a stable validation accuracy over several epochs. Other possible criteria could be based on time constraints, computational resources, or manual inspection of model performance. In this study, it appears that different models were trained until they reached their respective best performances, but the exact stopping criterion is not explicitly stated.
