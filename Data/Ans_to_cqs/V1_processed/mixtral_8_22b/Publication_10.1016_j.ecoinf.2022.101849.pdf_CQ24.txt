Based on the provided context, there isn't any direct information about strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, specifically regarding random seed values. However, it does mention several strategies used in machine learning and data processing that involve randomness.

One strategy mentioned is random reduction, where each target in the dataset is reduced by a random fraction. Another strategy is non-random (biased) reduction, where only certain targets are reduced randomly. These reductions can help simulate real-world scenarios with missing or incomplete data.

Additionally, the context discusses the use of clustering algorithms like k-means and hierarchical clustering in the partial imputation algorithm. Clustering involves grouping similar instances together, often relying on random initialization. To mitigate the effects of randomness, one common practice is to run multiple iterations of the algorithm with different initializations and then select the best result or average them.

While these strategies do not directly address managing randomness in the form of random seed values, they demonstrate ways to manage randomness within datasets and algorithms. For handling random seed values specifically, common practices include fixing the seed value for reproducibility, running experiments with multiple seeds and aggregating results, or intentionally varying the seed value to test robustness.
