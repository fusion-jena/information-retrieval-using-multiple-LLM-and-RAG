The text does not provide explicit information about the specific optimization technique used for selecting the hyperparameters of the model. However, it mentions that the learning rate is automatically reduced by a factor of 0.1 when the validation loss has not improved for 15 consecutive epochs. This suggests that some form of early stopping or learning rate scheduling might be employed during the training process. Additionally, the Adam optimizer is used with specific hyperparameters (β1=0.9, β2=0.999, and ϵ=10^-8), but no further details regarding their selection are mentioned. Therefore, based on the available information, it cannot be determined whether techniques such as grid search or random search were utilized for hyperparameter optimization.
