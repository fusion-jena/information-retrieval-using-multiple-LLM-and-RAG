Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, we can infer some aspects related to this topic.

Firstly, the text mentions that the dataset was divided into two parts: 70% for training and 30% for validation. This division suggests that the model performance might have been monitored using cross-validation techniques, where the validation set is used to evaluate the model's performance after each epoch or iteration during training.

Secondly, the context discusses the use of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). In RNNs, including LSTMs, monitoring strategies often involve tracking metrics like loss and accuracy over time. Additionally, visualization tools may be employed to observe trends in these metrics throughout the training process.

Lastly, the context emphasizes the importance of interpretability in deep learning models. While this doesn't directly address the monitoring strategy, it implies that any chosen method should ideally provide insights into the model's behavior and decision-making processes.

In conclusion, while the exact strategy for monitoring the model performance during training isn't specified, based on common practices in machine learning and the context provided, it could involve cross-validation techniques, tracking of key metrics, and possibly visualization tools.
