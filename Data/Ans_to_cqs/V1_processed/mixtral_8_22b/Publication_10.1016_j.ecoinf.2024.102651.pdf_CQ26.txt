The text does not provide information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some common methods include stratified splitting, which ensures that different subsets maintain the same proportions of class labels; oversampling, where minority classes are duplicated to balance the dataset; undersampling, where majority classes are reduced to achieve balance; and diverse data collection, which aims to gather more representative samples from underrepresented groups. These techniques can help mitigate data bias and improve the overall performance of deep learning models.

Based on the given context, it appears that the authors have focused on developing a hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN) and vision transformer (ViT) architecture called CA-Hybrid for microorganism classification. They claim that their proposed model outperforms other networks such as ResNet50 and ViT in terms of classification accuracy. To enhance the performance further, they incorporated Class Activation Mapping (CAM) into the residual network, allowing the network to focus on important regions within images. This resulted in improved classification accuracy across all categories ("medium" and "small").

However, there is no mention of any specific techniques employed to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide detailed information regarding the use of stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection in this particular study.
