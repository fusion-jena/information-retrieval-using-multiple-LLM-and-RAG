Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any specific technique used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some common techniques used to handle data imbalance or bias include stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. These techniques help ensure that the model does not become biased towards certain classes due to uneven distribution of data.

In the case of the given context, the authors do mention that they use a ratio of 1:9 to split the labeled pixels of the UAV hyperspectral image into training and testing sets. This could potentially indicate that they are using stratified sampling to maintain class balance between the two sets. However, without further clarification from the authors, it cannot be confirmed if this was done specifically to address data bias.
