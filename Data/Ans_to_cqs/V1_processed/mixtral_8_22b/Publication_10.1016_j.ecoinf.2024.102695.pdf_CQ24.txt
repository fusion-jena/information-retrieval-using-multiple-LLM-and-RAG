The text does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, specifically regarding random seed values. However, it mentions some strategies related to managing variability and uncertainty in the models. One such strategy is the use of Bayesian optimization in Di Nunno et al.'s (2023) work, which can help tune hyperparameters and improve model performance. Another strategy mentioned is the implementation of an early stopping mechanism during training, which prevents overfitting issues and ensures convergence before reaching the final epoch. Furthermore, the text discusses dividing datasets into training, validation, and testing sets, with a chronological division to better represent real-world scenarios and enhance the model's generalizability. Although these strategies do not directly address handling randomness in the form of random seed values, they contribute to managing variability and uncertainty within the deep learning pipeline.
