Training completion is determined based on the validation loss curve metrics. In this case, the model selected was the one trained until epoch 6 out of the 50 epochs trained. This suggests that the criterion used to determine when training is complete could be reaching a certain number of epochs or observing a plateau or decrease in the validation loss curve. However, the exact criterion is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
