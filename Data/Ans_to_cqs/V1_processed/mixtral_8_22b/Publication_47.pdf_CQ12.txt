The paper uses a custom deep neural network called IUC-NN, which stands for IUCN Red List Neural Network. It does not explicitly state whether it is based on convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN), transformers, or another type of deep learning model. However, since it is built using TensorFlow, it could potentially be any of these types depending on how the authors have designed their specific implementation.
