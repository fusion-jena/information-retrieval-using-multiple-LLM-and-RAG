Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available in the given context to provide a detailed explanation about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, based on common practices in machine learning projects, after training the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model, the next step would typically involve saving or serializing the model so that it can be loaded later without needing to go through the entire training process again. This could be done using various libraries like Pickle in Python or Java Serializable interface. Once serialized, the model can be deployed onto different platforms depending upon the use case requirements. These platforms may include cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, etc., or edge devices for real-time predictions. But since no specific details regarding these steps are mentioned in the provided context, I am unable to give more precise information.
