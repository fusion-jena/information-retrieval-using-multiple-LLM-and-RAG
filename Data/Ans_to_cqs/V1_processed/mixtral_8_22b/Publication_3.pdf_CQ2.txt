The study uses audio data from bird calls, specifically spectrograms derived from the audio files. These spectrograms serve as the input for the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model employed in the research. Therefore, the primary data format utilized in this deep learning pipeline is audio data, processed into spectrograms for further analysis.

Based on the information provided, there is no mention of other data formats such as images, videos, or CSV being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it should be noted that TensorFlow, the machine learning framework used in this study, supports various data formats including images, text, and structured data like CSV.
