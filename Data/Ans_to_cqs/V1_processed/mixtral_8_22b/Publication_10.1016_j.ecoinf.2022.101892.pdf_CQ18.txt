The text does not provide explicit information about the specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions that the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) was calculated to evaluate the performance of various models. Additionally, the Cross-entropy loss function was employed for optimization purposes. These metrics could be monitored throughout the training process to assess the model's progress and adjust hyperparameters if necessary.
