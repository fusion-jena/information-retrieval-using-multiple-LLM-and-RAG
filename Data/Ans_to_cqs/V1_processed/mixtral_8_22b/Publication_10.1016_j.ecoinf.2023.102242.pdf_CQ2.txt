Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention what specific data format(s) are used in their deep learning pipeline. However, considering they mentioned "high-resolution remote sensing data" and "feature information", we can infer that they might be using image or raster data formats such as GeoTIFF, JPEG, PNG, etc. These types of data are commonly associated with remote sensing applications. Additionally, since they discuss feature optimization tools and classification methods, it suggests that they could also be working with vector data formats like shapefiles or geodatabases containing spatial attributes. Nevertheless, without explicit confirmation from the text, I cannot definitively state the exact data formats used in their deep learning pipeline.
