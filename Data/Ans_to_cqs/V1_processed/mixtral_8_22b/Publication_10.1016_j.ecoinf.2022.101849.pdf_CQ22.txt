The primary evaluation metric used to compare the performance of different approaches is the Mean Absolute Error (MAE). This metric was chosen because it is easily interpretable and naturally scales for predictions of fraction values between 0 and 1. The performance of the models is evaluated only on complete test set observations. For incomplete observations, where the true underlying distribution of the target values is unknown, the prediction accuracy is measured by checking whether the largest predicted fraction of each observation matches the actual value. This is done similarly to a classification task.
