The text does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the authors use image data for their study, specifically focusing on insect species identification. They likely collect these images through field surveys or potentially by utilizing existing databases or public datasets containing insect images. Additionally, they might employ various sensors such as cameras or drones to capture high-quality images of insects in their natural habitats. It is also possible that they use bounding box techniques to isolate individual insects within larger images before feeding them into the deep learning model. Nevertheless, the exact methodologies employed for gathering raw data remain undisclosed in the given information.
