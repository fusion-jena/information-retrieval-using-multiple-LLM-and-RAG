The given context does not provide information on the specific type of deep learning model being used or its purpose. However, based on the provided tables containing values for Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), these two metrics appear to be used to evaluate the performance of the model. These metrics are commonly used in regression tasks to measure the difference between predicted and actual values. Lower values indicate better performance. It should be noted that other metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall may also be relevant depending on the nature of the task and the desired outcomes.
