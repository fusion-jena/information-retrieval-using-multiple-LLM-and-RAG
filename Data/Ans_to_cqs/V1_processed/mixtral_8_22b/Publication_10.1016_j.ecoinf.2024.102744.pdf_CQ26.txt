The text does not provide explicit information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of focal loss as a solution to handle imbalanced datasets. Focal loss is a modified version of cross entropy loss that downweights easy examples and focuses training on hard negatives. It reduces the relative loss for well-classified examples and puts more focus on hard misclassified examples. By doing so, it helps alleviate the problem of class imbalance during training. Other common techniques to address data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, but these are not mentioned explicitly in the given context.
