The paper does not explicitly mention any standard dataset such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that six open source Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were selected for the classification task: VGG16, ResNet50, ResNet101, Inception-v3, DenseNet201, and EfficientNetB0. These architectures have been pretrained on the ImageNet dataset, but the authors do not specify if they use these pretrained weights directly or fine-tune them on another dataset.

It can be assumed that the authors collected their own dataset consisting of images of the invasive alien plant species Cortaderia selloana and possibly other plant species native to Portugal. This assumption is based on the fact that the authors discuss the challenges of identifying this specific plant species due to its visual similarity with other plants and the lack of other plant species in Portugal with the same features as C. selloana. Furthermore, the authors present results in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and f1-score for various CNN architectures applied to this task.
