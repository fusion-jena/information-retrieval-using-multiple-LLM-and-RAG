Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the input dataset is integrated into the TPEBO-LSTM model during the training process. It can be any relevant dataset suitable for the task of forecasting China's agricultural carbon emissions using deep learning models like LSTM. Common datasets used in deep learning include MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet, among others, depending on the application and problem domain.
