Based on the given context, there isn't any direct information about handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline. However, some common strategies to manage randomness in such scenarios can be discussed.

Randomness in deep learning pipelines usually arises from various sources like initial weights, shuffling of training data, dropout layers, etc. To ensure reproducibility and consistency across experiments, one strategy is fixing the random seed value. By setting a fixed seed value, we can reproduce the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers, which helps maintain consistent results between different runs of the same experiment.

Another approach is to use deterministic algorithms wherever possible. For example, instead of using stochastic gradient descent, one could opt for batch gradient descent or other deterministic optimization methods. Similarly, choosing non-randomized versions of certain operations, like sorting or sampling, can help reduce randomness in the pipeline.

Lastly, it's essential to understand that some level of randomness might still exist even after employing these strategies. In such cases, running multiple trials with different seeds and averaging the results can provide more robust estimates of performance.
