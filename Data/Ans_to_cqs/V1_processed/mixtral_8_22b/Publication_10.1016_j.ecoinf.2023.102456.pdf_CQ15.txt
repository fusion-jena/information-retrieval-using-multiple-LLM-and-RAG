Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, the text does mention the use of the Gumbel-softmax function, which is often employed to optimize neural networks involving discrete variables. This technique is particularly useful in areas like reinforcement learning and generative models. The Gumbel-softmax function approximates any discrete distribution to a continuous distribution, allowing for gradient-based optimization methods to be applied. It introduces a stochastic element into the computation process, maintaining its character but potentially affecting estimates.

While the context doesn't directly discuss traditional optimization techniques like SGD or Adam, these methods are commonly used in conjunction with various functions and architectures in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, even though they aren't explicitly mentioned here, it's reasonable to assume that some form of optimization technique would still be necessary for training the described neural network.
