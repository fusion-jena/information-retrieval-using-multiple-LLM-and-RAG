Unfortunately, there is no information about the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in this research. The provided context only discusses the methodology of creating fire risk maps using Landsat 8 imagery and vegetation indices, along with some details about the study area and its environment. There is no mention of any specific software or programming languages used, nor any reference to a public code repository where the implementation could be found. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information regarding the availability of the deep learning pipeline's source code.
