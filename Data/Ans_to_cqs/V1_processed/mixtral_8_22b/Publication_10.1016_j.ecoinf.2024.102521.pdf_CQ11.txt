Unfortunately, based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the studies mentioned. It would require further investigation or additional context to provide a direct link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. However, some of the cited papers might contain links to relevant datasets within their respective articles. For instance, the paper titled "Bulk arthropod abundance, biomass, and diversity estimation using deep learning for computer vision" could potentially include dataset links in its Methods section or supplementary materials. Similarly, the article "Getting the bugs out of AI: advancing ecological research on arthropods through computer vision" might also have relevant dataset links. Lastly, the study "A systematic review on automatic insect detection using deep learning" could offer insights into various datasets used across different research projects. Therefore, I recommend checking these sources for more detailed information regarding the deep learning pipelines and associated datasets.
