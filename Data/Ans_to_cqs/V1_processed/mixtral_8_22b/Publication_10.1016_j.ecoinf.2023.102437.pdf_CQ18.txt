The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involved progressive training and forecasts by changing the starting time of the forecast but not using the information that is not accessible at the start of prediction period. This approach ensured that each forecast was a fair cross-validation. The prediction error was obtained by calculating the difference between the predicted value and the validation data at different starting times. Additionally, the size of the training data |Dm| = m * ma * mb + 1 depended on the starting time tm, indicating that the length of the time series used during the learning phase could impact the predictive performance.
