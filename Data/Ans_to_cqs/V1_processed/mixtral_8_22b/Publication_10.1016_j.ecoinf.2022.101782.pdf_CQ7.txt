The text does not provide explicit information about how the data was split for deep learning model training. However, it mentions that the best model was selected based on minimal validation loss that occurred at epoch 448. This suggests that the data was likely divided into training and validation sets. Additionally, the performance of the model was evaluated on an independent test set of 2060 images, indicating that there was also a separate test set. Therefore, it can be inferred that the data was split into three parts: training, validation, and testing. Unfortunately, the exact proportions of each split are not mentioned in the given context.
