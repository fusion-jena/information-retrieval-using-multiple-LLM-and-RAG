Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it can be inferred that the authors have attempted to improve the robustness and accuracy of their model by employing various strategies. For instance, they have utilized a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer with an initial learning rate of 0.01 and a cycle learning rate of 0.2. Additionally, they have implemented a depth-attention mechanism within the YOLOv5 network, which helps focus on more relevant features while reducing noise. Furthermore, the models were trained using a large batch size of 32, which could potentially contribute to better generalization capabilities. Nevertheless, without further details regarding the dataset and its diversity, it cannot be definitively stated whether these measures directly address the issue of ensuring the generalizability of the deep learning model.
