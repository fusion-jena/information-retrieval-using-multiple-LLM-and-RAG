The given context does not provide information about specific data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Instead, it focuses on the process of feature extraction using a generative model and training an MLP for classification tasks. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the data annotation techniques used in this deep learning pipeline.
