Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide a detailed response about how the trained deep learning model was deployed. However, based on common practices in machine learning projects, some possible steps for deployment could include:

1. Model Serialization: After training the model, it can be saved or serialized into a file format such as.h5,.pkl, or.pb, depending on the framework used (like TensorFlow or PyTorch). This allows the model to be easily loaded and used later without having to train it again.

2. Platform Selection: Once the model has been serialized, it needs to be integrated into a platform where it can be utilized. Depending on the use case, this might involve integrating the model into a web application, mobile app, or other software system. Some popular platforms for deploying machine learning models include AWS Sagemaker, Google Cloud AI Platform, Azure Machine Learning Studio, and Flask (for creating REST APIs).

3. Testing & Validation: Before fully deploying the model, it should undergo rigorous testing and validation to ensure its performance meets expectations. This may involve evaluating the model against new datasets, monitoring its accuracy over time, and making adjustments as needed.

Without specific details regarding the project mentioned in the given context, these general steps outline a typical approach to deploying a trained deep learning model.
