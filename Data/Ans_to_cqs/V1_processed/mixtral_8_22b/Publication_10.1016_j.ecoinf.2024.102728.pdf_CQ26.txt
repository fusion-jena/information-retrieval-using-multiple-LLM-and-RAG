The paper by Cohen and Shashua (2017) discusses the use of deep convolutional networks for image processing tasks, but it does not specifically mention any techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, there are several common techniques used to address this issue.

One technique is stratified sampling, which involves dividing the dataset into subsets based on certain characteristics or labels, and then randomly selecting samples from each subset to create training and testing sets. This ensures that the distribution of these characteristics or labels is preserved in both sets.

Another technique is oversampling, which involves duplicating examples from underrepresented classes in order to balance the class distribution. Undersampling, on the other hand, involves removing examples from overrepresented classes to achieve the same goal. Both methods can be effective in reducing bias caused by imbalanced datasets.

A third approach is diverse data collection, which involves collecting data from a wide range of sources and perspectives in order to reduce bias and improve model performance. For example, if a model is being trained to recognize images of animals, it may be beneficial to collect images from different regions, habitats, and lighting conditions in order to capture a wider variety of animal appearances.

In summary, some common techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline include stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. These techniques aim to ensure that the training and testing sets accurately represent the true distribution of the data, and that the model is able to generalize well to new, unseen data.
