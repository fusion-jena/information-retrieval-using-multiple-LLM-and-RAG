The paper does not provide information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, including managing random seed values. However, some common strategies to manage randomness include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using techniques like cross-validation or bootstrapping to estimate model variability, and employing ensemble methods to average out the effects of randomness. These strategies help ensure consistent results and improve the robustness of models when dealing with random processes inherent in deep learning pipelines.
