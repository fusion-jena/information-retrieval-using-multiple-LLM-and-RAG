Based on the given information, it is not explicitly stated what criteria were used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. Typically, the dataset is divided randomly into three subsets: training set, validation set, and testing set. The training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Finally, the testing set is used to evaluate the final model's performance. However, since there is no explicit mention of how the data was split in this case, we cannot provide a definitive answer based on the available information.
