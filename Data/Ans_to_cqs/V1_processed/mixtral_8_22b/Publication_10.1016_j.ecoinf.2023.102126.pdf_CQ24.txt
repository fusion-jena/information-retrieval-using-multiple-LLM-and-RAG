Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to provide an accurate response about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, some common strategies used to manage randomness include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, employing techniques like cross-validation or bootstrapping to account for variability, and utilizing ensemble methods to combine multiple models trained with different initializations.
