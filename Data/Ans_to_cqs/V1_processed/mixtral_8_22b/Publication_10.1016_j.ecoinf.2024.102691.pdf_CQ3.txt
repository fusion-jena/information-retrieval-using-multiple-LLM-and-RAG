Based on the given context, it appears that the authors have utilized object extraction and segmentation processes for their deep learning pipeline. These techniques can be considered as part of the data annotation process. However, the specific details regarding the use of bounding box annotation or instance segmentation are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer about the exact data annotation techniques employed in the deep learning pipeline.

However, considering the general practices in deep learning pipelines, it is common to use bounding box annotations for object localization tasks such as object detection. Instance segmentation, on the other hand, involves labeling each pixel of an object with its corresponding class label, providing more detailed information about the objects present in the image. Both these techniques help train deep learning models effectively.

Without further context or information, I am unable to determine if both bounding box annotation and instance segmentation were used in the deep learning pipeline discussed in the provided context.
