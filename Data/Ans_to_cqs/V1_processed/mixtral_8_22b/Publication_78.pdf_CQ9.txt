The information provided does not specify where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions various techniques such as SVM, LBP, HOG, LETRIST, GLCM, CJLBP, LTrP, AlexNet, ResNet-50, VGG-19, GoogleNet, Inceptionv3, CoralNet BoF, and their performance metrics like sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F1-score, and Cohen's Kappa. However, it does not provide any details about the availability or location of the data repository. Therefore, I do not have enough information to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
