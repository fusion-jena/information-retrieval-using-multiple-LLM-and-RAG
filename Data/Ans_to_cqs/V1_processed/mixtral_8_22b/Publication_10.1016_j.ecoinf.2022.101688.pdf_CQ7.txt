The data was split into training (60%) and testing (40%) sets by randomly selecting entire audio files. The selection was made in such a way that the training audio files were mutually exclusive to the testing audio files. This approach ensured a fair evaluation of the model. The testing files were generally recordings over different days. No specific mention of a validation set was made in the given context. However, it can be assumed that a separate validation set might have been created during the pre-processing stage or during the training phase to fine-tune the model's performance.
