The paper does not provide explicit information about the method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the given context, one could infer that aerial imagery was used as part of the input data for training the deep learning models. This suggests that remote sensing or satellite imagery might have been employed for gathering the necessary data. Nevertheless, without further details, it cannot be confirmed if other sources such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets were also incorporated into the process.
