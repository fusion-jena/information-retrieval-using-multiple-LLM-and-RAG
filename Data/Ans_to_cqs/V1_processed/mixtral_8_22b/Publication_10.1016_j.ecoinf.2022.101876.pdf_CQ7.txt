The text does not explicitly state the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, based on general practices in machine learning, one common approach is to randomly divide the entire dataset into three subsets: training set, validation set, and test set. Typically, around 70-80% of the data is allocated for training, while the remaining 20-30% is divided equally between validation and testing. The training set is used to fit the model, the validation set helps tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting during training, and the test set evaluates the final model's performance. It should also be noted that the exact proportions may vary depending on the specific requirements or constraints of each project.
