The performance of the deep learning model, specifically the cluster analysis function of Kaleidoscope (also known as the recognizer), is evaluated using two primary metrics: precision and recall rate. These metrics are commonly employed for assessing bird recognizer performance.

Precision is calculated by dividing the number of true positives (in this case, Nighthawk vocalizations) by the total number of candidate sounds within the cluster labeled as "Nighthawk". This gives us an understanding of how many of the identified sounds were actually correct identifications.

The recall rate, on the other hand, is determined by dividing the total number of true positives detected by Kaleidoscope by the total number of Nighthawk vocalizations present in the validation dataset. This metric provides insight into how well the system can identify all instances of the target sound (Nighthawk vocalizations) from the available data.

The validation dataset used for these calculations consists of 210 15-minute recordings, which have been manually annotated by an experienced observer to indicate the number of Nighthawk songs present in each recording. This dataset includes 120 recordings with confirmed presence of the species.
