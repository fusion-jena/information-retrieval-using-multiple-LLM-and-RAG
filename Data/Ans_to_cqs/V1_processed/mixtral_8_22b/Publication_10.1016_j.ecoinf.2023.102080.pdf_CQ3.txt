The given context does not provide specific information about data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, based on the general understanding of machine learning pipelines, these techniques could potentially be applied depending on the nature of the problem and dataset. In the absence of explicit information regarding data annotation methods, one cannot definitively state what techniques were employed in the described process.
