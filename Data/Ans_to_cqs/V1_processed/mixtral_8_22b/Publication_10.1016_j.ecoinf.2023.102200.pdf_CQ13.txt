The paper does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The authors mention using the Bird's Eye View (BEV) Faster Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) algorithm but do not discuss any details regarding its implementation or configuration. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact hyperparameters used in this study.
