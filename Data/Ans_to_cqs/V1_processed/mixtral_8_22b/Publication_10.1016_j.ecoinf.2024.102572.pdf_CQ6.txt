Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved to ensure the input data is suitable for the model. These steps may include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing or correcting any inconsistencies, errors, or missing values in the dataset. It also includes handling outliers which might affect the performance of the model.

2. Normalization/Standardization: Deep learning models often perform better when numerical input variables are scaled to a standard range. This is because these models use gradient descent optimization algorithms, which work best when all input variables are on a similar scale. Normalization scales the data between 0 and 1, while standardization transforms the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

3. Feature Scaling: Similar to normalization, feature scaling ensures that each feature contributes proportionately to the final output. Without feature scaling, attributes with larger numeric ranges may influence the prediction more than attributes with smaller numeric ranges.

4. Encoding Categorical Variables: Deep learning models cannot directly handle categorical variables. Therefore, they need to be converted into numerical form. One common method is one-hot encoding, where each category becomes a new binary column.

5. Splitting Dataset: The dataset is usually split into three parts - training set, validation set, and test set. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the test set is used to evaluate the final model.

In the given context, the researchers first obtain the MODIS projection details using the “ee.projection()” API on Google Earth Engine (GEE), then implement the “ee.reduceResolution()” function to rescale the image resolution. They also filter the feature collection on GEE by using the MCD64A1 date attribute “Burndate”. However, these steps seem to be specific to their particular application and not general preprocessing steps for deep learning models.
