The text does not directly discuss specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some relevant information can be extracted from the given context.

In the first piece of context, it mentions that the track ID method failed due to insufficient data collected at the field site. This suggests that having enough data is crucial for successful implementation of the method. Inadequate data might lead to biased results, which can be mitigated by collecting diverse data.

The second piece of context discusses the relationship between the test set size and the training set size. It states that optimal classification accuracy was achieved when the test set size was smallest relative to the training set. This implies that balancing the class distribution within datasets may improve performance. Techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling can help achieve balanced classes.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets while maintaining the same proportions of target variables as in the original dataset. Oversampling increases the frequency of minority class samples, while undersampling reduces the frequency of majority class samples. These methods aim to reduce imbalance in the dataset, thus minimizing potential bias.

Although the text does not explicitly mention these techniques, they align with the principles discussed in the context. Therefore, it can be inferred that techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection could potentially be employed to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
