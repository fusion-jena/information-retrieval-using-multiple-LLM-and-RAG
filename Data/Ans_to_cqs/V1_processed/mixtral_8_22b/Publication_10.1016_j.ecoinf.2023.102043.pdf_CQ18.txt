Based on the given context, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using a form where users can indicate the correct prediction in case a model misclassification occurs. This functionality is expected to assist in gathering data in order to improve the classification algorithm in an online mode. Additionally, the dataset is divided into 70% for training, 10% for validation, and 20% for testing purposes, which allows monitoring the model performance during training through validation and testing sets.
