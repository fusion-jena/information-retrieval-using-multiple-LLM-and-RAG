The method utilized for collecting raw data in this case is through the use of biophys sensors developed at the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ). These sensors are designed as long-term standalone data logging instruments capable of measuring valve-gaping using magnetism/hall effect sensor (DRV5053VAQLPGM), water pressure (pressure sensor - MS580314BA01â€“00), and temperature (temperature sensor - TSIC506F). The valve-gaping measurement is based on hall-sensor measurements. All sensors are located in the head of the Biophys sensors. More detailed information about the sensors and data processing to convert sensor output to valve gape amplitude can be found in Bertolini et al. (2021c).
