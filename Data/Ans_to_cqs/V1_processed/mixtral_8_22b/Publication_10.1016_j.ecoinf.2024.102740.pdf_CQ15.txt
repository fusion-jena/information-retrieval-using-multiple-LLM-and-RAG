The given context does not provide specific details regarding optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it discusses hyperparameter tuning strategies for Random Forest, a machine learning algorithm often used for tasks like classification and regression. It also mentions the use of Maximum Tree Depth and Minimum Number of Samples as parameters during the application of Random Forest. Additionally, the context refers to the use of QGIS software for geospatial analysis and the employment of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data for remote sensing applications.
