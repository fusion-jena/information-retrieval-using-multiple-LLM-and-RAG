The papers cited do not directly address the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, some general insights can be gathered from the references. For instance, the paper by Bowden et al. (2002) discusses optimal division of data for neural networks in water resource applications, which implies the use of sensor or monitoring data. Similarly, Chadalawada et al. (2017) mention system identification of rainfall-runoff models, suggesting the use of meteorological and hydrological data collected through various means such as weather stations, satellite imagery, or groundwater level measurements.

Moreover, the reference list includes several studies on machine learning techniques applied to different fields like wind forecasting (Feng et al., 2017), hydrology (Wang & Ding, 2003), and streamflow forecasting (Dehghani et al., 2023). These applications often rely on time series data obtained from sensors, remote sensing devices, or other measurement instruments. Additionally, the study by Uncuoglu et al. (2022) compares multiple machine learning algorithms for solving civil engineering problems, indicating the potential use of diverse datasets sourced from various domains.

While these examples provide indirect evidence of possible data collection methods, it is essential to note that the specific sources of raw data may vary depending on the problem domain and research objectives. Therefore, researchers should carefully consider their unique requirements when selecting appropriate data collection strategies.
