Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide a specific answer regarding the deployment process of the trained deep learning models mentioned in the given context. However, generally speaking, after training a deep learning model, the common steps involved in its deployment include saving or serializing the model, selecting a platform for hosting the model, and integrating the deployed model into an application or service. This usually involves exporting the model weights and architecture details into a file format such as HDF5, ONNX, or TensorFlow SavedModel, which can later be loaded onto a server or cloud environment. Popular platforms for deploying machine learning models include AWS SageMaker, Google Cloud AI Platform, Azure Machine Learning Studio, and others. Without further context, I cannot provide any specific details about the deployment process for these particular models.
