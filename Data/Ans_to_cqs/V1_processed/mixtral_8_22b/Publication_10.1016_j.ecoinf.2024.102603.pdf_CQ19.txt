The given context does not provide specific information about which frameworks were used to build the deep learning model. However, it mentions that deep learning models often require GPUs or TPUs for processing, which are commonly supported by popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. Therefore, it can be inferred that either TensorFlow or PyTorch could have been used to build the deep learning model, but without explicit mention in the context, the exact framework remains unknown.
