The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does discuss some aspects related to deep learning models, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and their application in identifying bird species using audio data.

In general, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization involves adjusting the range of pixel intensity values so they fall within a certain range, often between 0 and 1. Scaling refers to resizing images to fit the input size required by the model. Cleaning involves removing noise or irrelevant information from the dataset.

While the context does not provide explicit details about preprocessing steps, it mentions that BirdNET uses a deep neural network to detect and classify bird vocalizations from sound recordings. This implies that some form of preprocessing might have taken place to convert raw audio data into a format suitable for analysis by the deep learning model. Additionally, the context mentions that BirdNET has a configurable parameter called 'detection sensitivity,' suggesting that there could be some level of thresholding or filtering applied during preprocessing.

However, without more specific information regarding the exact preprocessing steps used in this particular case, it is impossible to definitively answer the query based solely on the provided context.
