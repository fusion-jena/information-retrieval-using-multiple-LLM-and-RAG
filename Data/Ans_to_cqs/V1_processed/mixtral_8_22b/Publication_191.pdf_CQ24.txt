The provided context does not contain information about specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing the impact of random seed values. However, common practices in handling randomness include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, employing ensemble methods to reduce variance, and utilizing techniques like dropout regularization to prevent overfitting due to randomness during training.
