Unfortunately, there is no information provided about the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the exact data augmentation techniques used in this case. However, some common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, padding, and adding noise. These techniques help increase the size and diversity of the training dataset, which can improve the generalization ability of the model and prevent overfitting.
