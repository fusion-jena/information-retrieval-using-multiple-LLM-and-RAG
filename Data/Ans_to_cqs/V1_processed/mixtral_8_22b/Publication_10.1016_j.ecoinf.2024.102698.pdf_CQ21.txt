The text does not provide explicit information on the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, based on general machine learning practices, common postprocessing steps include evaluating the performance of the trained model using various metrics, creating visualizations like saliency maps or confusion matrices, fine-tuning hyperparameters, and validating the model with new data. In this case, the text mentions the use of mean data quality score and mean data diagnostics scores as part of the evaluation process, suggesting that these might be used as postprocessing steps. Additionally, the text discusses ranking sites based on their values, indicating that sorting or filtering results might also be included in the postprocessing steps.
