To ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model, the authors took several measures. Firstly, they addressed the issue of overfitting caused by small datasets due to the limited number of species in each fish family. They achieved this by introducing the Elastic Net into their proposed method, which improved its generalization ability. Secondly, they employed the EN-SAE model to handle outgroup scores and automatically learn the decision threshold using the KDE technique. This approach allowed them to propose a novel predictor based on outgroup scores, which is not typically considered in other classification studies. Lastly, they evaluated the performance of their method quantitatively and compared it to four commonly used machine learning methods. Their results showed that the ESK model outperformed these methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and feasibility for fish classification tasks. However, there was no explicit mention of diverse datasets or specific validation techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting being used in the given context.
