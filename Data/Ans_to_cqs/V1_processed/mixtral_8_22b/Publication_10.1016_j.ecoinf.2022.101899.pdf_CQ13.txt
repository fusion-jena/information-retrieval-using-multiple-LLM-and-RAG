Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model for wildfire event predictions in Australia. Halgamuge et al. (2020) mentioned analyzing six different optimizer models using deep learning technology but did not provide details about the exact hyperparameters such as learning rates or specific optimizers like Adam, RMSprop, or others. Similarly, Dowdy (2020) discussed a seasonal prediction system for wildfire event prediction in Australia without specifying the hyperparameters used in their deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the precise hyperparameters employed in these studies from the available information.
