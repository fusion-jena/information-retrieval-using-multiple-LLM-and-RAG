The text does not provide explicit information about specific data annotation techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it mentions that manual labeling was performed through visual inspection by trained graduate students. This process likely involved categorizing sounds based on their appearance in spectrogram images. The annotation technique appears to involve selecting relevant spectrograms containing useful information and assigning them to appropriate sound categories. It is also mentioned that only 10-15% of the spectrograms from each selected day were annotated, suggesting that the focus was primarily on identifying meaningful sounds rather than exhaustively labeling all available data. Additionally, the use of transfer learning and pre-trained models indicates that the team leveraged existing knowledge and resources to enhance their own dataset and improve classification performance.
