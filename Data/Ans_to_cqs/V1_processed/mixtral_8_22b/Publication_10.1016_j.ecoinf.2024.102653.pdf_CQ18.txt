The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves partitioning the dataset into training and validation sets. In this case, 70% of the data was designated for training, while the remaining 30% was set aside for validation. This division was performed through random selection using the train_test_split function from the scikit-learn library. During the training process, the accuracy of both the training and validation datasets was monitored. The accuracy of the models for each previously published dataset was evaluated separately, as well as the accuracy of models trained with multiple datasets combined. Additionally, the accuracy of models trained with varying numbers of days of records per bee was also assessed. The values at the bottom of the graph in Figure 4 indicate the final validation accuracy.
