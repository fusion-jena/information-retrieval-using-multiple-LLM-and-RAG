The text does not provide explicit information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of various pre-trained models such as AlexNet, DenseNet-201, GoogLeNet, ResNet-101, ResNet-18, VGG-16, and VGG-19, which suggests that publicly available datasets like ImageNet might have been used for training these models. Furthermore, the mention of a custom dataset called 'VnPollenBee' indicates that this dataset could have been collected using specific methods suitable for the task of bee image classification. Unfortunately, without more detailed information, it is impossible to determine the exact methods used for collecting raw data in this case.
