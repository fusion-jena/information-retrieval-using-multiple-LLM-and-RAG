To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the authors employed diverse datasets consisting of various underwater optical images. Using a diverse dataset helps prevent overfitting and improves the model's ability to perform well on unseen data. Secondly, the paper mentions the use of mosaic data augmentation techniques applied to the initial images during the preprocessing stage. Data augmentation methods help create new training samples from existing ones, which further increases the diversity of the dataset and enhances the robustness of the model. Lastly, although the paper does not explicitly mention cross-validation or stratified splitting, it discusses the use of a batch size of 16 for all networks. Uniformly setting the batch size across different networks could be considered a form of regularization, helping improve the model's generalizability by reducing variance and preventing overfitting.
