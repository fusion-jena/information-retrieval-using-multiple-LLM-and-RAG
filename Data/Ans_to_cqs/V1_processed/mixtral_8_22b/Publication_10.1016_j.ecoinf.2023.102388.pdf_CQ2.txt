The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the data format used is images or videos since the text discusses using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image processing tasks like image classification, image segmentation, and face recognition. Additionally, the context mentions utilizing machine learning models for monitoring, species identification, and individual animal recognition through the utilization of camera traps, specialized stationary camera configurations, and uncontrolled video recordings. Therefore, it can be concluded that the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are primarily images and videos.
