The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using metrics such as prediction accuracy and loss. Prediction accuracy measures how often the model correctly predicts the output for new input data, while loss represents the difference between predicted values and true values. In this case, the highest score from the metrics indicates the highest rank in an array where a single sample is inferred to 'n' given classes, and the prediction label is the index of the highest score.

Furthermore, model loss is calculated using compound loss, which combines softmax cross-entropy and regularization loss. Softmax cross-entropy measures the distance between two distributions, with lower cross-entropy indicating that they are more similar. Meanwhile, regularization loss is included to prevent overfitting, striking a balance between model performance and complexity. To normalize losses, softmax is employed to map the true loss value between zero and one.
