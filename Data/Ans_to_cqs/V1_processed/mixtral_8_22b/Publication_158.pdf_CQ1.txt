The given context does not provide information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the dataset consists of satellite imagery, which suggests that remote sensing technology such as satellites might have been employed to gather this data. Additionally, the text discusses various techniques used to improve the performance of the deep learning model, including adjustments to input image size, network configuration, depth, and width, as well as different training strategies. It also describes the use of the Adam optimizer, categorical cross-entropy loss function, and data augmentation techniques like rotation, reflectance bias, and random noise. Lastly, the context explains how multiple models were generated and their outputs averaged to create an ensemble, along with the application of early stopping criteria during training.
