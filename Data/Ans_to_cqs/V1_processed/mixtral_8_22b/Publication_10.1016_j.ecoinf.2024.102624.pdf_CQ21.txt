After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be taken to evaluate and enhance the performance of the trained models. Some common postprocessing steps include:

1. Model evaluation metrics: Calculating various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves, etc., to measure the performance of the trained models.

2. Confusion matrices: Creating confusion matrices to visualize the performance of the trained models by comparing actual vs. predicted classes.

3. Cross-validation: Applying cross-validation techniques like k-fold cross-validation to estimate the predictive power of the trained models and prevent overfitting.

4. Hyperparameter tuning: Fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the trained models to optimize their performance based on the validation set results.

5. Data augmentation: Extending the existing training data through data augmentation techniques to improve the generalization capabilities of the trained models.

6. Post-classification: Performing post-classification operations like segmentation and filtering to generate better maps with fewer salt-and-pepper errors.

7. Outlier removal: Excluding outliers from the training data to refine the training samples and improve the classification accuracy.

8. Proportion adjustment: Adjusting the proportion of the training and test data to achieve better modeling of the environment.

In the given context, the authors have performed some of these postprocessing steps, including applying 10-fold cross-validation with three repetitions during the model building phase, calculating overall accuracy (OA) distributions, and performing hyperparameter tuning to find the best models with the largest OA. They also mention the use of the caret package in R for conducting classifications and hyperparameter tuning. However, they do not explicitly discuss other postprocessing steps like creating confusion matrices, fine-tuning hyperparameters, or removing outliers.
