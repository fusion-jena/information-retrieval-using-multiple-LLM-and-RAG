Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, from the context, we can infer that the authors employed a grid search approach to optimize their Random Forest (RF) model's hyperparameters. This optimization process involves testing various combinations of hyperparameter values and evaluating the model's performance using cross-validation techniques. In this case, they used Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as the evaluation metric, aiming to minimize it to achieve the most accurate predictions. Therefore, it could be assumed that the completion of training might have been determined by achieving the lowest possible RMSE or reaching a point where further improvements in RMSE became negligible. Nonetheless, without direct confirmation from the text, this remains speculative.
