The text does not explicitly state the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions a process involving splitting the dataset into multiple subsets, including a tuning set and a validation set. It suggests that the model is trained on the tuning set while monitoring its performance on the validation set. This implies that some form of performance metric or error measurement is being tracked during the training process. While the exact criterion isn't specified, common practices often involve tracking metrics such as validation loss or accuracy, and stopping the training once these measures reach a satisfactory level or stop improving significantly. Therefore, based on typical machine learning practices, one could infer that the completion of training might be determined by observing a plateau or minimal improvement in the chosen performance metric on the validation set.
