The provided context does not directly discuss specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Instead, it focuses on the use of presence-only (PO) data from various citizen science platforms like eBird, Pl@ntNet, iNaturalist, and Observation.org, which are available on the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF).

However, when dealing with PO data, one must consider potential issues such as species identification errors and over-aggregation of records. In this case, the authors propose a method to handle these challenges by employing a penalized loss function with an L1 penalty for simultaneous shrinkage estimation and variable selection. This approach helps minimize the impact of heterogeneous observations and improve predictions compared to traditional methods.

While the context doesn't explicitly mention data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines, it highlights the importance of addressing data quality concerns in ecological studies. Proper data annotation techniques, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, play a crucial role in ensuring accurate labeling and improving the performance of machine learning models.
