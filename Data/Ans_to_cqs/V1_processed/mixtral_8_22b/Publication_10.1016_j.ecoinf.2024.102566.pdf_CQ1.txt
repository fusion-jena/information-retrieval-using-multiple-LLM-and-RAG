The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the context that field-collected data is one method used for gathering raw data. Additionally, the use of remote sensing imagery suggests that sensors or satellite data may also be utilized for data collection. Furthermore, references to forest inventory data indicate that survey data might be another source of raw data. Public datasets are not explicitly mentioned but could potentially be included in the data sources.
