The authors determined the optimal number of training steps based on two factors: 1) correct identification rate, which improved up to a certain point before reaching a plateau where further improvement was not significant, and 2) processing time, which increased linearly with the number of training steps. They found that for the Mexican dataset, consisting of 12 species, 2,000 training steps were optimal, resulting in an 83.0% overall identification rate. This determination was made by observing the largest gap between the processing time trace and identification rate after 2,000 steps. Beyond this number of steps, only minor improvements in identification rate were observed despite longer processing times.
