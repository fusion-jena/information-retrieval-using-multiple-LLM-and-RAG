The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific type of deep learning model used in the proposed pipeline. It only mentions that machine-learning models were employed to predict the potential effects of climate change on animal spatial distribution in the Massaciuccoli Lake basin. Therefore, without further details or additional context, it cannot be determined whether a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Transformer, or any other deep learning model was utilized in this particular study.
