The text does not explicitly mention the specific types of data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does provide some clues regarding the type of data being processed. In particular, the text mentions that CNN is typically applied to input data of large size, such as 2D or 3D arrays, like images. Therefore, it can be inferred that the deep learning pipeline described in the text likely involves processing image data. Additionally, the use of convolutional layers suggests that the input data has spatial correlations, further supporting the idea that the data may be in the form of images. While other data formats such as audio or video could also potentially be used, the text does not provide enough information to definitively determine this.
