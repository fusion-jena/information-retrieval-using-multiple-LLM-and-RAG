The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves examining the progression of validation performance (Bv). To find the 'optimal' number of training epochs, models are trained until there is no improvement in validation performance after a certain threshold of epochs. In this case, the threshold was set to 25 epochs, but it could vary depending on available time resources. Once the optimal number of epochs is determined based on the highest Area Under Curve (AUC) in predicting Bv, the final model is selected and used to classify the test data (data set T). The performance of this model is then measured using AUC.
