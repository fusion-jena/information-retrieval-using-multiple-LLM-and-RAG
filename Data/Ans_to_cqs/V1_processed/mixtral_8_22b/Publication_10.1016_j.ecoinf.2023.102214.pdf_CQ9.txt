According to the given context, the researchers contributed the largest fully labeled snow leopard dataset for deep learning research. They anticipate that their novel deep learning methods will encourage other academics to contribute more datasets to Whiskerbook.org for continuously curating and enhancing the data used to improve the deep learning pipeline. However, there is no explicit mention of the specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available, such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, it can be assumed that the data repository for the deep learning pipeline is Whiskerbook.org.
