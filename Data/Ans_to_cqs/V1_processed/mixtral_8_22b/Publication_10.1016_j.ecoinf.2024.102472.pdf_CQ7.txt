Based on the given context, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training include using validation data for choosing the lowest error during the Multi-Layer Perception Neural Network (MLPNN) training phase. In this case, the network featured two hidden neurons. Additionally, the context mentions that the network requires tests to determine optimal learning rate, momentum, and training iterations. However, the specific criteria for splitting the data into training, testing, and validation sets are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

In general, when working with deep learning models like MLPNN, data is often divided into three subsets: training set, validation set, and test set. The training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set is used to tune the parameters and prevent overfitting. Finally, the test set is used to evaluate the performance of the fully-trained model. Common practices for dividing the dataset include using 60-70% of the data for training, 15-20% for validation, and 15-20% for testing. However, these percentages can vary depending on the size and nature of the dataset.
