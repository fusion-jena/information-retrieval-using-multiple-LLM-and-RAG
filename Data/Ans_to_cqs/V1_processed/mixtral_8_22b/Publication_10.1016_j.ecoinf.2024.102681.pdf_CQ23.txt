To ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model, the authors employed several strategies. Firstly, they compiled a comprehensive dataset comprising various influencing factors and an extensive drought propagation time series spanning from January 1950 to December 2020. Secondly, they used a sliding window method with a window size of 30 years and a step size of one year to generate forty-two distinct datasets, each corresponding to a separate period. This strategy allowed them to capture the temporal dynamics of various factors' influence on drought propagation more accurately. However, the paper does not explicitly mention the use of techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting to further enhance the model's generalizability.
