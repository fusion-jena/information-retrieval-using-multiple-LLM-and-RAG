The given context does not explicitly mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it mentions that these methods can be applied in sub-real time on limited hardware. Additionally, it discusses the computational time of various noise reduction methods, including CMGAN, which has a constant computation time due to constrained input sample rates. Based on this information, we can infer that the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model might include GPUs or other specialized processors designed for handling complex computations efficiently. Nevertheless, without explicit details about the hardware resources used, it is impossible to definitively determine whether GPUs, TPUs, or any other specific hardware was utilized during the training process.
