After the model training, there are several postprocessing steps involved. However, based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Nevertheless, we can infer some possible postprocessing steps based on common practices in machine learning projects.

One possible postprocessing step could involve evaluating the performance of the sound identification model using various metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, accuracy, etc. These metrics help quantify how well the model performs in identifying different bird species accurately. Additionally, creating a confusion matrix would also provide insights into the types of errors made by the model, i.e., misclassifying one bird species as another.

Furthermore, generating saliency maps could be another potential postprocessing step. Saliency maps highlight the regions in the input spectrograms that contribute most significantly towards the final prediction made by the model. This information can aid in understanding why certain predictions were made and improve the overall interpretability of the model.

Lastly, feeding back the initially inferred sounds reviewed by experts into the training data, as mentioned in the context, can be considered a form of postprocessing. This iterative process allows for continuous improvement of the model by incorporating new training examples, especially for rare bird species.
