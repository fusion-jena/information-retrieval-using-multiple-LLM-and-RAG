The text does not provide information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, common postprocessing steps include generating saliency maps to visualize important features, calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., and creating confusion matrices to evaluate the performance of the classifier. These steps help in understanding how well the model has learned and where it might need improvement.
