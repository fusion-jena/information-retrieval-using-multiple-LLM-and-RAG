Based on the given information, there isn't any explicit mention of the specific strategy employed for monitoring the model performance during training. However, it can be inferred from the text that the authors have divided their dataset into two parts - one for training and another for testing purposes. This approach allows them to assess how well the model has learned by evaluating its performance on unseen data (the test set). Additionally, they use three metrics to gauge the model's effectiveness: Average Accuracy (AA), Overall Accuracy (OA), and Kappa Coefficient (K). These measurements provide insights into the model's ability to accurately classify samples across all categories and its overall consistency in making correct predictions.
