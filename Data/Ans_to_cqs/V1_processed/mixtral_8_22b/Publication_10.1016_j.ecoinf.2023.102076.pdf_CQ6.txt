The provided context does not explicitly mention all possible preprocessing steps typically used before training a deep learning model, but it does describe specific preprocessing steps taken for a particular task involving text classification using BERT. These include:

1. Tokenizing the text using the NLTK word-tokenizer to divide the documents into smaller chunks of 300 tokens each. This helps manage computational resources since BERT can only handle a maximum of 512 tokens as input.

2. Retaining only those chunks containing relevant keywords related to the classification task. For instance, if the task involves identifying bats and their exploitation, then only those chunks containing bat-related or exploitation-related terms are kept.

3. Selecting the first keyword-containing chunk from each document for use in model training and evaluation.

4. Further tokenizing the selected chunks using the BERT tokenizer before feeding them into the BERT model.

5. Setting a maximum limit on the number of tokens allowed for different types of inputs â€“ 400 tokens for social media posts and 512 tokens for web articles. Any excess tokens will be truncated during this stage.

These preprocessing steps help prepare the raw text data for efficient processing and analysis by the deep learning model. Other common preprocessing techniques like normalization, scaling, and cleaning might also be necessary depending on the dataset and the specific requirements of the deep learning model.
