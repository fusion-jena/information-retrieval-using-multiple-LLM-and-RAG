The text does not provide specific information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, it mentions that the study used a deep learning approach called Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs). The optimization of hyperparameters is typically done using techniques such as Grid Search, Random Search, or more advanced methods like Bayesian Optimization. Given that the authors used BNNs, they might have employed Bayesian Optimization to tune their hyperparameters. Nevertheless, without explicit mention of this detail in the given context, we cannot be certain about the method used for hyperparameter tuning.
