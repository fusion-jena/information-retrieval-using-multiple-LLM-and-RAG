The provided context mentions several types of datasets used in various applications, including housing datasets, email spam filtering text datasets, synthetic datasets, and Brodatz texture datasets. Additionally, there is a reference to acoustic data and images such as Texture Image Segmentation and Intel Berkeley Dataset. These datasets suggest that different data formats like CSV files, text data, and image data are utilized in the deep learning pipelines mentioned in the given context. However, it does not explicitly mention any specific format for video or audio data. Therefore, based on the provided context, we can infer that CSV, text, and image data formats are used in the deep learning pipelines discussed here.
