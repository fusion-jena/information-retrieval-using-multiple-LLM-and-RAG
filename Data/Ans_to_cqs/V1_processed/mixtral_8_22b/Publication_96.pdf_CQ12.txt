In this study, the authors utilized a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model for their research. A DNN is a subset of deep learning algorithms inspired by the structure and function of biological neurons. It consists of multiple layers of interconnected nodes or 'neurons,' allowing for complex pattern recognition and decision-making processes. Unlike other types of deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or Transformers, DNNs are typically employed for tasks involving large datasets and high dimensionality, making them suitable for applications such as image classification, speech recognition, and natural language processing.
