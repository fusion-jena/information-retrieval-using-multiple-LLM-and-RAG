In the given context, the implemented deep learning model uses color spectrograms of two-second durations as inputs. Spectrograms are visual representations of the spectrum of frequencies of a signal as it varies with time. They are commonly used in the analysis of audio signals, including speech and music. Therefore, the input format used in this deep learning pipeline is essentially derived from audio data. However, since the spectrograms are represented as RGB images, they can also be considered as a form of image data.

Moreover, the context mentions that the ResNet50 model was pre-trained on ImageNet data, which consists of millions of labeled images. This indicates that the model has been trained on image data before being adapted for use with spectrograms. Additionally, the context suggests that other datasets like AudioSet and VGG-Sound can also be used for pre-training, further emphasizing the importance of both audio and image data in this pipeline.

Therefore, based on the given context, we can conclude that the deep learning pipeline primarily utilizes audio and image data formats. There is no mention of any other data formats like video or CSV files.
