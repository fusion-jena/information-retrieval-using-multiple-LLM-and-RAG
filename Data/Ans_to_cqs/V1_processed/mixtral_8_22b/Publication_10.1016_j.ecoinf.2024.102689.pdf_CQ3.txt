The text provides information about the use of two main data annotation techniques in the deep learning pipeline: bounding box annotation and instance segmentation. Bounding box annotation is commonly used for standalone object detection tasks, where it involves recognizing and marking objects with rectangular or square shapes around them. On the other hand, instance segmentation is employed when there is a need to distinguish between different instances of the same class of objects. This technique requires more detailed annotations, such as pixel-level labeling, which can be time-consuming but provide better accuracy.

In the given context, the researchers integrated their detection module with instance segmentation, requiring the inclusion of mask annotations that precisely align with the segmented contours during dataset preparation. Both bounding boxes and masks were classified within the Roboflow integrated visualization to ensure uniformity and coherence. After preparing the annotated dataset, they moved forward to input it into the chosen benchmark model for several rounds of rigorous training. This iterative process allowed them to derive the optimal set of weights that enhance the modelâ€™s performance to its maximum.

Therefore, the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline include bounding box annotation and instance segmentation. While bounding box annotation is suitable for simple object detection tasks, instance segmentation offers more precise results by distinguishing between different instances of the same class of objects.
