The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is not explicitly stated but can be inferred from the given information. Based on the text, it appears that the deep learning model is being used for two main purposes: forest type categorization and enhancing the performance of a fire risk prediction model.

The first purpose involves using the XGBoost model, which is known for its ability to identify features and patterns in large image datasets, to classify or categorize different types of forests. This is done using high spatial and ultra-high resolution remote sensing data collected by UAVs and SPOT satellite equipment.

The second purpose is to improve the accuracy of a fire risk prediction model. It seems that the researchers are aiming to combine a deep learning model with an optimization algorithm to create a hybrid model for predicting forest fire vulnerability. This could potentially help in identifying areas at higher risk of forest fires based on various factors such as the presence of oil trees, vines, dry branches, and fallen leaves.

In summary, while the exact purpose of the deep learning model isn't directly mentioned, it can be understood that it is primarily being used for forest type classification and improving the performance of a fire risk prediction model.
