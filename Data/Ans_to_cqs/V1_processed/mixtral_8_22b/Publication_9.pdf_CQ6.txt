The text does not provide explicit information about specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it mentions that the overarching goal of training a neural network is to iteratively minimize the error between model output and expected output by optimally adjusting model weights and reaching model convergence. It also states that the utility of pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) depends on how relevant the novel input data are to the data the CNN was originally trained on. Therefore, one might infer that some form of preprocessing would likely involve ensuring that the input data is appropriately scaled and normalized so that it aligns with the original dataset used to train the pre-trained CNN. Additionally, depending on the nature of the input data, cleaning operations such as removing noise or irrelevant features might also be necessary.
