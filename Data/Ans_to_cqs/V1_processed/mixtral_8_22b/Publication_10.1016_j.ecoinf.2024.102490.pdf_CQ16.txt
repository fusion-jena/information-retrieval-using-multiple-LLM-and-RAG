The text does not provide explicit information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, it mentions that 80% of the data was used as the training set, while the remaining 20% was used as the evaluation set to assess model performance. This suggests that the evaluation set might have been used to monitor the progress of the training process and decide when to stop training. Common criteria for stopping training include reaching a certain number of epochs or iterations, observing a plateau or decrease in the validation loss, or achieving a desired level of performance on the validation set. Without more specific details from the text, it cannot be determined which exact criterion was used in this case.
