The given context does not provide any direct reference to the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, without further information, it is impossible to determine the exact code repository link. However, based on common practices, if the authors published their work, there might be a chance that they also shared their code publicly. You may want to check popular platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket by searching for keywords related to the paper title, author names, or other relevant details.
