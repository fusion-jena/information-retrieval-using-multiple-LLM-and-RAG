Based on the given information, it appears that the machine learning models are evaluated on their performance on a testing set after being trained on a separate training set and optimized on a validation set. However, there is no explicit mention of specific criteria used to determine when training should be stopped or considered complete. Typically, common stopping criteria include reaching a certain number of epochs, achieving a desired level of performance on the validation set (such as a minimum validation loss), or observing a plateau in the validation loss over several epochs. Without more detailed information about the specific implementation of the machine learning models, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer regarding the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete.
