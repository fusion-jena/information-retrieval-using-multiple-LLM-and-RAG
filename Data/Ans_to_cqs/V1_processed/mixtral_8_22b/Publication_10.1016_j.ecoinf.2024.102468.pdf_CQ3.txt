The given context does not provide explicit information regarding the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it mentions that there were manual detections made for different types of calls, which suggests that some form of manual annotation was performed. Additionally, the text refers to an IWC-SORP/SOOS annotated library, indicating that this library contains annotated data. Unfortunately, without further details, we cannot determine the exact nature of these annotations.
