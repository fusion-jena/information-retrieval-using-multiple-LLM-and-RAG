The given context does not provide specific details on the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. The context primarily focuses on metadata fields related to image acquisition, processing, and curation for satellite and aerial images. It discusses various aspects such as image orientation, illumination, scale reference, practical constraints, datetime, longitude, latitude, depth, meters above ground, acquisition settings, pixel per millimeter, area square meter, curation protocol, annotation QAQC, use of bait, mapping, sampling, and camera orientation to the subject. However, it does not mention the specific deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers used in the pipeline. Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot determine what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline.
