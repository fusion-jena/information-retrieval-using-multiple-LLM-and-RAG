The deep learning pipelines mentioned in the given context utilize two main datasets: BirdCLEF2018-Small (BC-S), BirdCLEF2018-Large (BC-L), Lishui-Zhejiang Birdsdata (LS), and Lishui-Zhejiang Birdsdata (LS*). These datasets were released in different years, with BC-S and BC-L being published in 2018, while LS and LS* were published in 2024. The BC-S and BC-L datasets contain recordings from Europe and America, whereas the LS and LS* datasets consist of recordings from China. Each dataset has its own set of sounds and categories, which can be found in Table 3 of the provided context.
