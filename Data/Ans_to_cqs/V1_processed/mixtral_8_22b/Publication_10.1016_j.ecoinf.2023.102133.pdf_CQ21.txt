The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps used after model training. However, based on common practices in machine learning, some possible postprocessing steps could be:

1. Model Evaluation: This involves calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC, etc., to evaluate the performance of the trained model.

2. Confusion Matrix: It is often used to visualize the performance of the algorithm. Each row of the matrix represents the instances in a predicted class while each column represents the instances in an actual class.

3. Cross-Validation: To ensure the robustness of the model, cross-validation techniques like K-Fold can be applied.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning: After initial training, tuning the hyperparameters of the model might improve its performance. Grid search or random search methods can be employed for this purpose.

5. Saliency Maps: These are particularly useful in image classification tasks where they highlight the pixels contributing most to the final output.

However, without more specific details regarding the type of model being used and the problem domain, these suggestions remain speculative.
