The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Highway Network (RHN), which is a variant of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The CNN is used in the encoder part of the model to extract features from exogenous variables such as water discharge, release, and washout flux. The RHN is then employed in both the encoder and decoder parts of the model to process these extracted features and historical target variable data, respectively. The use of hierarchical attention mechanism further enhances the performance of the model by assigning weights to the encoded representations based on their relevance.
