The information provided does not explicitly state which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. However, based on the mention of Google Earth Engine (GEE) being used for various tasks such as processing big geospatial data, producing systematic data products, and deploying interactive applications backed by its resources, it can be inferred that the deep learning model might have been deployed on the Google Cloud Platform, specifically utilizing the capabilities of GEE. Nevertheless, without explicit confirmation, this remains an assumption.
