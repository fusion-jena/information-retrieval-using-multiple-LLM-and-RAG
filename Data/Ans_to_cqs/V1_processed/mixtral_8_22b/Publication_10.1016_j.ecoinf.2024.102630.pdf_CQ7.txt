Based on the given context, it does not provide direct information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, generally speaking, when splitting data for machine learning models, including deep learning models, common practices include using random sampling techniques like stratified sampling or k-fold cross-validation. These methods help maintain balance among classes and prevent overfitting or underfitting of the model. In some cases, temporal or spatial partitioning may also be employed depending on the nature of the dataset. It should be noted that the choice of splitting strategy depends on various factors such as the size of the dataset, class distribution, and the type of problem being addressed.
