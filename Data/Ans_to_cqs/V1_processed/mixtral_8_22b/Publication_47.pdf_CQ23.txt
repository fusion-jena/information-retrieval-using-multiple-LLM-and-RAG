To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the model was trained using a diverse dataset consisting of all species with an IUCN Red List assessment and available occurrence records. This helped to capture the variability present within the population of interest. Secondly, before the training process began, the dataset was randomly split into a training set (90% of the entries) and a test set (10%) to prevent overfitting and allow for evaluation of the model's performance on unseen data. Thirdly, 20% of the training set was utilized for validation purposes during the training phase. Lastly, due to the relatively small size of the dataset, cross-validation was employed by shifting the validation set five times. This enabled quantification of the average validation cross-entropy loss and accuracy, ensuring that the chosen model had optimal performance across different subsets of the data.
