The pipeline uses a custom Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) called CoralNet for extracting spatial features. CoralNet consists of thirteen layers, including three Conv2D layers, two MaxPooling2D layers, two dense layers, one flatten layer, and three activation layers. The input layer size is 227x227x3. Two activation layers use ReLU as their activation function, while the final activation layer employs softmax. Additionally, other pre-trained DCNN architectures like AlexNet, ResNet-50, VGG-19, GoogleNet, and Inceptionv3 were also utilized for comparison purposes.
