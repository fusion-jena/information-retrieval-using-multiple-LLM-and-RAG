The performance of the deep learning models, specifically VGG19 and ResNet50, is evaluated using several metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, F1-Score, and Recall. These metrics can be seen in Tables 11 and 12 for both models when using flattened convolution kernels with BATCH\_SIZE set to 64 and 128 respectively, and utilizing augmented datasets. Additionally, Table 5 shows the accuracy statistics of ResNet50 in various numbers of bands and data formats, while Table 6 presents the accuracy statistics of the combination of VGG19 and ResNet50 in different numbers of bands and data formats.
