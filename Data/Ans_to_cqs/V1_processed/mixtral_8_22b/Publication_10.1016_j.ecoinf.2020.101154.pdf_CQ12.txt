Based on the given information, it appears that the study uses Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT), which is a type of ensemble decision tree algorithm rather than a deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. Therefore, no specific type of deep learning model is mentioned in the provided context.
