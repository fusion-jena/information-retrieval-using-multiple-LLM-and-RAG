The performance of the deep learning models is evaluated using two main metrics: accuracy and loss. These metrics are calculated for both training samples and validation datasets during each epoch. In this case, the authors used sparse categorical cross-entropy loss to validate their models.

For instance, the MobileNetV2-based model achieved a training accuracy of up to 97% and a validation accuracy of up to 84%. Similarly, the MobileNetV3-Large-based model exhibited a training accuracy of 94% and a validation accuracy of up to 87%.

After fine-tuning, the training accuracy of the MobileNetV2-based model improved to 97%, while its validation accuracy remained at 86% at each epoch. On the other hand, the training accuracy of the MobileNetV3-based model improved to up to 96%, and its validation accuracy reached up to 89% after ten epochs.

Therefore, the primary metrics used to assess the performance of these deep learning models are accuracy and loss. However, there is no mention of other evaluation metrics such as precision or recall in the given context.
