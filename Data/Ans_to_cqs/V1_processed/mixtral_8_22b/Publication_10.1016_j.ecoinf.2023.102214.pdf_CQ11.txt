Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to provide the exact data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the researchers contributed the largest fully labeled snow leopard dataset for deep learning research to Whiskerbook.org. Therefore, one could potentially find the relevant data repository link by visiting Whiskerbook.org.
