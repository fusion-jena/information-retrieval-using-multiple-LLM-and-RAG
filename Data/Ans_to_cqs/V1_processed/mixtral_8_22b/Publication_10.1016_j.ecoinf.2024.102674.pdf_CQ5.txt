The text does not provide explicit information about specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that they obtained 12 datasets valid for 1970-2000, one for each month, from average monthly temperature data. These datasets were likely used in the deep learning process described in the paper.
