Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The text mentions acquiring GF-6 (WFV) data from the China Centre for Resources Satellite Data and Application but does not specify if this data is used in a deep learning pipeline or if it is publicly accessible on any repositories like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to your query based solely on the given context.
