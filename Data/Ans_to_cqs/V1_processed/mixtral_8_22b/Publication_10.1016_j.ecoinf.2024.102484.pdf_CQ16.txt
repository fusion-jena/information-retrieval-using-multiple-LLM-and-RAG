The judgment criteria for determining when training is complete can vary depending on the specific task and model being trained. However, one common criterion is reaching a validation loss plateau. This means that the performance of the model on the validation set stops improving significantly after a certain number of epochs. At this point, further training may not lead to any significant improvement in the model's performance, and continuing to train could even result in overfitting. Other possible criteria include achieving a target accuracy or F1 score on the validation set, or simply stopping training after a fixed number of epochs. Ultimately, the choice of criteria will depend on the goals and constraints of the particular application.

Based on the given context, it appears that the study uses the Max(A,B) < C < A + B criteria to judge the interaction between paired factors. Additionally, the study mentions using the geographical detector method which requires a large sample size. However, there is no information regarding the criteria used to determine when training is complete. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a helpful answer to the query.
