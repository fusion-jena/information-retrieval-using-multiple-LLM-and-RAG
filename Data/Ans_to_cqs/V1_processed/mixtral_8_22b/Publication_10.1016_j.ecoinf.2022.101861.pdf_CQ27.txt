The text does not provide explicit details about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, it mentions that the model was used for automatic identification of bird species based on their sounds using the BirdNET app, which suggests that the model might have been deployed through this application. Additionally, the reference to Wood et al.'s (2022) paper indicates that the authors likely discuss the deployment process in detail within that publication. Unfortunately, without further context or access to the mentioned sources, it is impossible to provide specific information about the exact steps taken during the deployment process.
