The information provided does not explicitly mention any specific data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotation, or scaling. However, it is mentioned that the authors have used data from a public authoritative repository of big data (GBIF) which has been improved with reliable records they observed in the field. This could suggest some form of manual data augmentation by adding more accurate and direct observations to improve the existing dataset. Additionally, there are references to papers related to improving data quality and parallelizing the execution of native data mining algorithms for computational biology, but these do not provide explicit details about data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, without further context or information, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the specific data augmentation techniques applied in this case.
