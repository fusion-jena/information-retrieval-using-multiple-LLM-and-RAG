The text does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it mentions several techniques used to improve efficiency and accuracy in object tracking models like Deep SORT and SORT. These include integrating an AdaLAM-based module for better motion compensation, utilizing Feature Extraction Networks (FENs) to extract richer target information features, employing Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) for robust fitting, and incorporating efficient aggregation networks like ELAN and hybrid convolutional structures like MPConv. While these methods do not directly address randomness due to factors like random seed values, they contribute to enhancing overall performance and stability in deep learning pipelines.
