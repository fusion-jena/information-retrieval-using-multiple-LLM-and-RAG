The provided context does not directly discuss strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it does mention the use of random forests, a type of ensemble learning method, in ecological studies. Random forests work by creating multiple decision trees and combining them to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. Each tree is built using a different subset of the training data, chosen randomly with replacement (bootstrapping), and a random subset of features considered for splitting at each node. This inherently introduces randomness into the model. To manage this randomness, techniques like cross-validation can be used during training to evaluate the model's performance and prevent overfitting. Additionally, setting a fixed random seed value before training can help ensure reproducibility of results across different runs of the same model.
