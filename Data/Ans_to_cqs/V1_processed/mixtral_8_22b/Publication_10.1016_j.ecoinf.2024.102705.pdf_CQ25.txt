The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is not explicitly stated. However, based on the given information, it appears that the deep learning model is used for object detection. This is suggested by the mention of the YOLOv3 model, which is a popular real-time object detection system, being used as the baseline for all experiments. Furthermore, the use of Average Precision (AP) as a performance metric also indicates object detection, as AP is often used to evaluate the accuracy of object detectors. Therefore, while not directly stated, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is likely used for object detection purposes.
