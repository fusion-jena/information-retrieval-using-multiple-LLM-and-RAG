The information provided does not include a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a direct link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF based on the given context. To find the relevant data repository link, one would need additional information about where the authors have stored their datasets and code related to the deep learning tools mentioned in the paper.

Based on the available information, the closest reference to a potential data source is the mention of the Urban Sound Taxonomy (UST), which has been developed by Salamon et al. (2014). However, no explicit link to a data repository containing UST is provided in the context. It is recommended to refer to the original publication by Salamon et al. (2014) or contact the corresponding author(s) of the current study for further details regarding the availability of the deep learning pipeline data.
