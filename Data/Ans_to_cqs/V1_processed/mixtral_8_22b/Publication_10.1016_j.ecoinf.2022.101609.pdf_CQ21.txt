The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, based on general machine learning practices, some common postprocessing steps include metrics calculation, confusion matrix, saliency maps, and model interpretation techniques. These steps help evaluate the performance of the trained model and provide insights into its predictions.

Metrics calculation involves computing various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, etc., depending on the type of problem being solved. This helps quantify the performance of the model and compare it with other models or baselines.

A confusion matrix is a table layout that visualizes the performance of a classification algorithm. Each row of the matrix represents the instances in an actual class while each column represents the instances in a predicted class. This provides a more detailed view of the model's performance beyond simple accuracy.

Saliency maps are visualizations that highlight the regions of input data that contribute most significantly to the output prediction. They can be useful for understanding how the model makes decisions and identifying potential biases or errors.

Other postprocessing steps may involve interpreting the model's weights, coefficients, or activations to gain insight into its inner workings. This can help identify important features, interactions between features, or unexpected patterns in the data.
