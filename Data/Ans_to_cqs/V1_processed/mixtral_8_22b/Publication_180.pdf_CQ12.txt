The text does not explicitly state which specific type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline. However, it mentions that TensorFlow, an open-source software library for machine intelligence, is utilized for deep learning research and applications. TensorFlow can be used with various types of models including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Transformers. Without further information, it cannot be definitively determined which type of deep learning model is being used in the pipeline.
