The text does not provide explicit information regarding the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it can be inferred that some common postprocessing techniques might have been employed given the nature of the study. These may include metrics calculation such as overall classification accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Additionally, confusion matrices might also have been generated to evaluate the performance of the models. Furthermore, saliency maps or heatmaps could potentially have been utilized to visualize which parts of the input data contributed most significantly towards the final predictions made by the deep learning models. Nevertheless, without more detailed information, these remain speculative possibilities rather than definitive answers.
