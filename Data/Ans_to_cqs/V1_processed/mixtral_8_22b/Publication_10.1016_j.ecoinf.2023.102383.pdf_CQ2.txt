The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer that the data format used is likely related to images or videos since the text discusses using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are commonly applied to visual tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation. Additionally, the mention of Region of Interest (RoI) generation further supports this assumption, as RoI is often associated with image processing tasks. Therefore, while there isn't direct evidence, it is reasonable to assume that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline discussed here is either image or video data.
