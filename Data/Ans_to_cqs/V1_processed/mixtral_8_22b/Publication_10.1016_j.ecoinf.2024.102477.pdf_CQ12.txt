The pipeline uses an SGRU-based deep learning approach. SGRU stands for Simple Gated Recurrent Unit, which is a variant of the traditional GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) model. Both GRU and SGRU are types of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which are designed to handle sequential data such as time-series data. In comparison to the SLSTM (Seasonal Long Short Term Memory) model, another extension of RNNs mentioned in the context, the SGRU model showed significantly better predictive performance in terms of MAPE and RMSE metrics when applied to forecasting CO concentration over 36 months.
