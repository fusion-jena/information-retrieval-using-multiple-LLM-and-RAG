I apologize, but based on the given context, there isn't enough information to determine what optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses generating and selecting redescriptions, which involves running algorithms on a dataset, applying filters, and setting various parameters. However, it does not mention anything specific about deep learning pipelines or optimization techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to your query based on the given context.
