The given context does not provide specific details about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions several common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines, including flipping, rotation, and scaling. Data augmentation is a strategy that enables practitioners to significantly increase the diversity of data available for training models, without actually collecting new data. It involves creating modified versions of images in the dataset through random transformations like flipping, rotating, zooming, cropping, shifting, and scaling. This helps prevent overfitting and improves the generalizability of the model. In this case, since no specific data augmentation techniques were mentioned in the context, one cannot definitively state which techniques were applied in the deep learning pipeline.
