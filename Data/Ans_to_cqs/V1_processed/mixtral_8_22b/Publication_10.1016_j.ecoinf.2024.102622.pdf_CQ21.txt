After model training, several post-processing steps may be involved depending on the specific application and requirements. Some common post-processing steps include:

1. Model Evaluation: This involves calculating various metrics such as R^2, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Relative Percentage Error (RPE) to evaluate the performance of the trained model. In this case, Table 4 shows the accuracy evaluation of rice canopy coverage using different modeling methods like Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

2. Validation Set Prediction: After evaluating the model's performance, it can be used to predict values for the validation set. Figure 5 demonstrates the relationship between the field survey value and the predicted value of chlorophyll content from different models using the validation set.

3. Visualization: Post-training visualizations can help understand the model's behavior better. For example, Figures 4(a) and 4(b) show the maximal information coefficient (MIC) between vegetation indices (VIs) and leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) or crop coverage.

4. Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix is often used when dealing with classification problems to summarize the performance of the classifier. However, since this study focuses on regression tasks, there might not be any need for generating a confusion matrix.

5. Saliency Maps: Saliency maps highlight important features contributing to the model's output. They could be useful for understanding which input variables have more influence on the prediction. However, they aren't explicitly mentioned in the given context.
