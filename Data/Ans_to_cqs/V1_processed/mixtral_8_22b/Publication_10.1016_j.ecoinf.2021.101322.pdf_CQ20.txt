The text mentions that the implementation and training of the CNN were done using the Keras and TensorFlow software packages implemented in Python. For computation, CUDA version 9.1 and CuDNN were used along with Nvidia P100 accelerator cards with 12 GB of GPU memory. Therefore, it can be concluded that the hardware resource used for training the deep learning model is GPU.
