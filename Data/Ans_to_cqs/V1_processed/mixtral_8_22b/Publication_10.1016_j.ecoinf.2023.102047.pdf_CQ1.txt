The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that various sources of data have been employed in different studies related to seagrass mapping and identification. These include satellite imagery, such as 'WorldView-2' satellite images (Perez et al., 2020), and possibly other remote sensing techniques like drones or unmanned aerial vehicles (AUVs) (Martin-Abadal et al., 2018). Additionally, some studies may use publicly available datasets, such as the 'LookingForSeagrass' dataset mentioned in Weidmann et al. (2019). Other potential sources of data could include field surveys, sensor data, or manual collection of underwater images (Moniruzzaman et al., 2019; McKenzie, 2003). Nevertheless, without explicit information about each study's data collection methodology, this remains speculative.
