The text does not explicitly mention the use of any specific data format such as image, audio, video, or CSV in a deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses the pre-processing of imagery using different bands like RGB, Infrared, and NDVI, which suggests that the input data is likely in image format. The text also mentions the use of GLCM texture measures, indicating that the data could be processed as matrices or arrays. Additionally, there is no explicit reference to the use of deep learning algorithms or pipelines in this context. Therefore, based on the given information, it can only be inferred that the data format used is most likely image data.
