Based on the given context, it can be inferred that various methods are used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. These include:

1. Surveys: Surveys can be conducted to gather specific data relevant to the problem being addressed. For instance, in the context of estimating driver drowsiness, EEG signals were collected through surveys or experiments involving human subjects.

2. Sensors: Sensors play a crucial role in gathering real-time data for various applications. In the case of identifying oestrus and non-oestrus sounds of sows, acoustic data was collected using appropriate sensors. Similarly, sensors can be deployed to collect data on CO2 emissions, land use classification, and other environmental factors.

3. Public Datasets: Existing datasets can be leveraged to supplement or replace the need for primary data collection. Examples mentioned in the context include housing datasets, email spam filtering text datasets, Brodatz texture datasets, Intel Berkeley dataset, De Montfort University Robotics dataset, and others. These datasets can be used for tasks such as domain adaptation, multitask learning, and unsupervised transfer learning.

In summary, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline depend on the nature of the problem being addressed and the availability of existing datasets. Common approaches include conducting surveys, deploying sensors, and utilizing public datasets.
