The paper does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that an annotation tool was employed to save annotations as XML files in PASCAL VOC format. This suggests that the authors might have used bounding box annotation, which is a common technique used in object detection tasks. Bounding boxes are rectangular regions drawn around objects within an image to identify their location and classify them accordingly. The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) challenge dataset uses this type of annotation, where each bounding box contains information about its coordinates, width, height, and associated label. Therefore, based on these details, it can be inferred that the authors likely utilized bounding box annotation for their deep learning pipeline.
