Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of specific evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of a deep learning model such as accuracy, precision, or recall. The text primarily focuses on discussing the calculation of condition scores using equations and various parameters. It also mentions the use of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for evaluating the performance of FERM, but it does not provide information about any other evaluation metrics related to a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the specific evaluation metrics used for the deep learning model mentioned in the context.
