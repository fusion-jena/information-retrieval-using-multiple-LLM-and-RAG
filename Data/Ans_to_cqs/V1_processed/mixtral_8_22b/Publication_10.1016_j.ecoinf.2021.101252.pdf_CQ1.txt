The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, some clues can be found regarding the nature of the data used in deep learning pipelines. For instance, the text mentions the use of 'raw time series data', which suggests that data collection might involve sensors or other devices capable of recording measurements over time. Additionally, there is a reference to 'continuous climate data' being used instead of 'long-term climate averages'. This implies that real-time or near real-time data could be collected through various means such as weather stations, satellites, or drones equipped with environmental sensors. Furthermore, the context discusses the application of deep learning in ecology, where data might be gathered via field surveys, camera traps, acoustic recorders, or citizen science initiatives. Lastly, the citation of papers related to insect biometrics and image-based species identification indicates that imagery data could also play a significant role in certain deep learning pipelines within ecology. Therefore, while the exact methods for collecting raw data are not specified, one can infer that they may include a combination of sensor technologies, field observations, and publicly available datasets depending on the specific requirements of the deep learning task at hand.
