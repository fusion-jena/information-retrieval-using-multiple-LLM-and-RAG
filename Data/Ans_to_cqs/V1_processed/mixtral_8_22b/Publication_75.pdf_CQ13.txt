Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function is applied to the output of every convolutional layer, and there are six learnable layers, five of which are convolutional, and the last is fully connected. Additionally, max pooling with a 3x3 filter size and 1x1 stride is employed between successive convolutional layers.
