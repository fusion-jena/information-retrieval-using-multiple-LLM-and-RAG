The article does not explicitly mention which specific deep learning framework was used to build their model. However, one of the references mentioned in the text is about Mask R-CNN, which is an implementation of Region-Based Convolutional Neural Networks (R-CNN) built on top of TensorFlow. Therefore, it can be inferred that TensorFlow might have been used to develop the deep learning model presented in this study.
