Based on the provided context, it appears that the data was divided using a technique called cross-validation, specifically five-fold cross-validation. This method involves splitting the dataset into five equal parts or 'folds'. Four of these folds are used for training the model, while the remaining fold is used for validation. This process is repeated five times, ensuring that each fold serves as the validation set once. After training and validation, predictions for the entire unvalidated recording period were generated. Each of the five training folds was used to make a single prediction for every 8-second interval for the duration of the year. These five prediction records were then averaged together to create a single prediction record. However, the exact criteria used to divide the data into the initial five folds are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
