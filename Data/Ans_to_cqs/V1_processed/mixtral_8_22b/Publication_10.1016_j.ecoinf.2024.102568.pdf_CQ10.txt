Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to provide the exact code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the source code for the LSTM model used in this study is publicly available since it was mentioned that the availability of the source code facilitates customization for monitoring additional pollutants and ensures reproducibility. Therefore, I recommend checking any related publications or resources associated with this research for more details about accessing the source code.
