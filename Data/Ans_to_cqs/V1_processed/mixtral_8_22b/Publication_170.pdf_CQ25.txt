The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that the model is likely being used for image recognition or classification tasks based on the mention of the AlexNet model, which is commonly used for such purposes. Additionally, the text mentions a recognition rate, further supporting the idea that the model is being used for image recognition. It should be noted that without explicit confirmation, this remains an educated guess rather than a definitive statement.
