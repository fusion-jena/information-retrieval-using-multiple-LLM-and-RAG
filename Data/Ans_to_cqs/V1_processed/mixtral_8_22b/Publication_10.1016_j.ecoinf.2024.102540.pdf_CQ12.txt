The pipeline uses a specific type of deep learning model known as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs are a class of deep neural networks that are primarily used for processing grid-like data, such as images. They have gained popularity in various fields, including entomology, due to their superior performance in detection and classification tasks compared to traditional machine learning methods. In this case, five different versions of the YOLOv5 model family, namely YOLOv5n, YOLOv5s, YOLOv5m, YOLOv5l, and YOLOv5x, are employed to detect alates on sorghum leaves. These models belong to the YOLO (You Only Look Once) family of object detection models, which are built on the PyTorch machine learning framework.
