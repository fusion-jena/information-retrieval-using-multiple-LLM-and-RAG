Unfortunately, based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the type of optimizer employed. However, we do see references to certain aspects of the model architecture and its components. For instance, the text mentions the use of YOLOv7 as the baseline model, which incorporates Extended Efficient Layer Aggregation Network (E-ELAN), cascade-based modeling, model scaling, and model reparameterization. Additionally, the Kalman Filter (KF) is utilized for tracking purposes, with the state Xk vector and measurement vector Zk being defined in equations (8) and (9), respectively. Furthermore, the process noise covariance Qk and measurement noise covariance Rk are adjusted according to alternations in the state vector of the improved KF, as described in equations (10) and (11). Despite these details, without further information regarding the implementation of the deep learning model, it remains unclear what specific hyperparameters were chosen during the development and optimization processes.
