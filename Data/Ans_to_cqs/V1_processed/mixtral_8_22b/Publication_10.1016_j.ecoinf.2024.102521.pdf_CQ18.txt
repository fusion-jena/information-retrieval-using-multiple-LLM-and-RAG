Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of a strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does state that users can create task-specific classifiers upon request, and the performance of such a classifier is presented in the results section as case study 1. Additionally, users have access to tools like STARdbi\_split\_images and STARdbi\_train\_model to generate and train their own classification models. It can be inferred that users might employ common strategies to monitor model performance during training, such as tracking loss or accuracy over epochs, cross-validation, or early stopping. But without more specific details about the methods used, it cannot be definitively stated what exact strategy is employed to monitor model performance during training.
