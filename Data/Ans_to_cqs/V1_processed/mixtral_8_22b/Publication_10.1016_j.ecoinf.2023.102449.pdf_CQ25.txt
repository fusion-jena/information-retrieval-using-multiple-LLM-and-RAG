The text does not explicitly state the specific purpose of the deep learning model, such as classification, segmentation, or detection. However, it mentions that the model is designed as a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), which is typically used for tasks like dimensionality reduction, data generation, and anomaly detection. In this case, the model is being used to learn meaningful representations of ecological sounds, also known as ecoacoustics. This suggests that the primary goal of the model might be to extract useful features from audio recordings of natural environments, potentially for further analysis or monitoring purposes related to biodiversity and conservation efforts.
