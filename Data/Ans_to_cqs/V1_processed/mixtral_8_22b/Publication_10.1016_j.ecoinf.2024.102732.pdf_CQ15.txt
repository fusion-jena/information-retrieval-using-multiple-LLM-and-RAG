The given context does not provide specific information about optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, there are mentions of various optimization techniques used for different machine learning algorithms like Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost).

For RF, the mentioned optimization technique is Grid Search, which is used to identify optimal values for parameters like 'ntree' and'mtry'. Similarly, for SVR, the optimization process involves selecting the appropriate kernel function and optimizing the 'C' parameter. Lastly, for XGBoost, key parameters like 'nrounds','max depth','min child weight', 'gamma', and'subsample' are tuned using a Grid Search methodology.

These optimization techniques help improve the performance of the respective machine learning models by fine-tuning their parameters. However, they do not directly relate to optimization techniques typically used in deep learning pipelines like SGD or Adam.
