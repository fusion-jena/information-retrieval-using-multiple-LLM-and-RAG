The information provided does not explicitly mention which specific deep learning framework was used to build the model. However, one of the references cited is about scikit-learn, which is a popular machine learning library in Python. While it can be used for building deep learning models, it is more commonly associated with traditional machine learning algorithms such as support vector machines, decision trees, and random forests. Therefore, based on this reference alone, we cannot definitively determine if a deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch was used.
