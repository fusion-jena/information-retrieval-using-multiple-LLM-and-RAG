The pipeline uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as its deep learning model. This can be seen in several places throughout the given context. Firstly, the table titled "Table 3. CNN Architecture" lists various layers commonly found in CNN architectures such as convolutional layers, activation functions like ReLU, max pooling layers, dropout layers, and fully connected layers. Secondly, the text mentions popular CNN architectures such as VGG16, ResNet-50, and DenseNet121, further confirming the use of CNNs in the pipeline. Lastly, Figure 9 shows the training accuracy of different CNN models, providing additional evidence that CNNs are being employed.
