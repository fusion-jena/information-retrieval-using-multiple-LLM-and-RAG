Based on the given context, there is no direct information regarding strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it can be inferred from the context that the paper focuses on applying privacy-preserving deep learning (PPDL) techniques to satellite image classification. These techniques include encryption and differential privacy, with specific mention of homomorphic encryption, secret sharing, and secure multi-party computation. While these techniques address privacy concerns, they do not directly relate to handling randomness within the deep learning pipeline.

To manage randomness in the deep learning pipeline, common strategies include setting fixed seeds for various libraries (like NumPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch), ensuring consistent results across multiple runs. Additionally, some researchers may choose to report average performance over several runs with different initializations to account for variability due to randomness. However, these strategies are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
