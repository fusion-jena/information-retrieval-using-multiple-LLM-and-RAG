The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that some form of cross-validation or stratified splitting might have been used based on the mention of using 70% of the data for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for model testing. This approach is commonly employed to evaluate the performance of machine learning models and prevent overfitting. Additionally, the use of diverse input factors such as population size and GDP could contribute to improving the model's ability to generalize across different scenarios. Nevertheless, without more detailed information regarding the exact methods applied, it cannot be definitively stated which specific techniques were utilized to enhance the model's generalizability.
