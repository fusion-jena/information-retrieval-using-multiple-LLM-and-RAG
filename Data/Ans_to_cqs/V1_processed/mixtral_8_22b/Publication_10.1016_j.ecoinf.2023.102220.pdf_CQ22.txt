The text mentions several metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. These include the true positive rate (TPR), also known as sensitivity or recall, calculated as TP/(TP + FN); the false positive rate (FPR), calculated as FP/(TN + FP); and accuracy, calculated as (TP + TN)/(TP + TN + FP + FN). Additionally, the text discusses averaging these metrics over multiple groups (k=5) to assess overall performance. However, it does not explicitly mention other common evaluation metrics like precision or specificity.
