Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to determine which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. While it is mentioned that TensorFlow and Keras were utilized to build the neural networks, no explicit reference is made to any cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) being employed for deployment purposes. Therefore, without further details regarding the deployment process, it remains unclear which platform was chosen for this task.
