The text does not provide specific information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, common practices for deploying such models often involve model serialization, where the trained model is saved into a file format that can later be loaded by another program. Additionally, platform selection is crucial when deploying deep learning models, as it determines the hardware and software environment in which the model operates. Popular platforms for deploying deep learning models include cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, as well as edge computing devices like NVIDIA Jetson or Intel Neural Compute Stick. Without further details, it is impossible to determine the exact process followed for this particular case.
