The given context does not provide information on specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it mentions that machine learning techniques, including those based on deep learning, have the potential to automate fish aging by analyzing images of fish scales or otoliths. This suggests that optimization techniques like SGD or Adam may be employed in training these models, but the exact methods used are not specified within the provided context.
