The completion of a machine learning model's training can be determined by various criteria. One common criterion is observing the validation loss plateau, which occurs when the validation loss stops decreasing significantly with each epoch or iteration. This indicates that the model has learned most of what it can from the data and further training may lead to overfitting. Another criterion could be setting a predefined number of epochs or iterations for training. Additionally, early stopping can be employed, where training is halted if the validation loss does not improve after a certain number of epochs. Lastly, one might also consider monitoring metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score on the validation set to decide when to stop training.
