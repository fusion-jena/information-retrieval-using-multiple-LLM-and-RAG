Based on the given context, one dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is ImageNet. ImageNet is a large-scale hierarchical image database introduced in 2009 during the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition [Deng et al., 2009]. It contains millions of labeled images belonging to thousands of categories, making it suitable for training and evaluating deep learning models like those mentioned in the context: ResNet-101, Wide-ResNet-101, InceptionV3, and MnasNet-A1. However, the context does not provide any specific details about how these models were trained or evaluated using ImageNet.
