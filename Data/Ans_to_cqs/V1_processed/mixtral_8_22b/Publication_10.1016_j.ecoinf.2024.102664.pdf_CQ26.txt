While the given context does not directly discuss the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, some general methods can be mentioned based on common practices in machine learning.

Data bias can be addressed through several techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets or strata, ensuring each subset maintains the same distribution of target variables as the original dataset. Oversampling increases the number of instances from the minority class, while undersampling reduces the number of instances from the majority class to balance the dataset. Diverse data collection aims to gather data from different sources or populations to reduce bias and increase the representativeness of the dataset.

In the case of algal bloom forecasting for the Zhoushan fishery, addressing data bias might involve collecting data from multiple locations within the fishing area, considering temporal variations, and employing appropriate sampling strategies to ensure the dataset accurately represents the diversity and complexity of the environment. However, without explicit information about the preprocessing steps taken in this study, it is impossible to determine which specific techniques were employed to address data bias.
