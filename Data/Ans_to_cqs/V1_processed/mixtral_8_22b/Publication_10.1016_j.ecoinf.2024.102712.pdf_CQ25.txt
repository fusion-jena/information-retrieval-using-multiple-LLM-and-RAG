The provided context does not explicitly state the purpose of a specific deep learning model. However, it mentions several studies related to remote sensing and image processing in the field of ecology and environmental science. For instance, Congedo (2021) discusses a semi-automatic classification plugin for processing remote sensing images in QGIS, while Daryaei et al. (2020) explore fine-scale vegetation detection in semi-arid mountainous areas using Sentinel-2 and UAV data. These studies suggest that deep learning models could potentially be employed for tasks like image classification or object detection within these domains. Nevertheless, without further details about the specific research or application, it is impossible to determine the exact purpose of any given deep learning model mentioned in the provided context.
