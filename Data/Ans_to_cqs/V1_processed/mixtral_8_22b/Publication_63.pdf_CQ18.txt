During the training process, the authors monitored the model performance by splitting their dataset into 'training', 'validation', and 'test' datasets. They used a 4:1 ratio to divide the remaining data into 'training' and 'validation' datasets after extracting a random sample of 10% of the dataset for the 'test' dataset. The 'training' dataset was utilized to train the weights of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, while the 'validation' dataset helped indicate the training progress after each complete training cycle or 'epoch'. To evaluate the performance of the trained models independently, they used the 'test' dataset, which was not involved in the training process. Furthermore, the authors employed transfer learning by utilizing pre-trained layer weights from a classification task on a dataset available at [www.imagenet.org](http://www.imagenet.org), enabling them to leverage existing knowledge bases for their CNN models.
