Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be applied to ensure optimal performance. These may include data cleaning, where missing or irrelevant values are removed or replaced with appropriate substitutes. Normalization or standardization techniques might also be employed to scale numerical inputs into a common range, which helps prevent any single feature from dominating the others due to magnitude differences. Additionally, encoding categorical variables into numerical form could be necessary if they exist within the dataset. Lastly, splitting the dataset into separate training and testing sets allows for validation of the model's performance against unseen data. However, it should be noted that these specific preprocessing steps were not explicitly mentioned in the given context; thus, their application would depend on the unique requirements of the particular deep learning task being undertaken.
