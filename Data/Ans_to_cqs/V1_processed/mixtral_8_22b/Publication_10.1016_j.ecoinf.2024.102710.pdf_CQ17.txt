The authors did not explicitly mention any specific regularization techniques used in their deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting. However, they mentioned using transfer learning, which can act as a form of implicit regularization by leveraging knowledge gained from training on other datasets. Additionally, they discussed applying entropy loss or custom loss functions, which may also contribute to preventing overfitting indirectly. The authors suggested exploring potential improvements like applying Per-Channel Energy Normalization (PCEN), refining spectrogram feature engineering, or employing transfer learning with fine-tuning to enhance accuracy. Nevertheless, without explicit information about regularization methods used, it cannot be confirmed if these techniques were employed specifically for preventing overfitting.
