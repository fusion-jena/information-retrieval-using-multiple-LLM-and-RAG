The paper by Zhong, L., Hu, L., & Zhou, H. (2019) titled "Deep Learning Based Multi-Temporal Crop Classification" uses a deep learning model for the purpose of crop classification. The authors use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to extract features from multi-temporal satellite images and then perform classification using these extracted features. The goal is to accurately classify different crops based on their spectral and temporal characteristics. Similarly, the paper by Zhu, M., She, B., Huang, L., Zhang, D., Xu, H., & Yang, X. (2022) titled "Identification of soybean based on Sentinel-1/2 SAR and MSI imagery under a complex planting structure" also employs a deep learning model for the purpose of crop identification. They use a combination of Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imager (MSI) data to train a CNN model for identifying soybeans in a complex planting environment. Therefore, both papers demonstrate the application of deep learning models for the purpose of crop classification or identification.
