The text does not explicitly mention which specific type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline. It only mentions that a supervised machine learning classification method is employed for burn area detection, but no further details are given about the exact nature of the model. Therefore, based on the information available, I cannot determine whether a convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), transformer, or another type of deep learning model is utilized in the pipeline.
