Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer some possible methods based on the mentioned studies and their applications.

In general, remote sensing techniques are widely used for gathering data related to land cover, vegetation, and other environmental factors. These techniques often involve utilizing various types of satellite or airborne sensors, such as optical sensors (e.g., Landsat 8 OLI, Sentinel-2) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems. Some examples include Wang et al.'s study on estimating natural forest biomass using an artificial neural network and remote sensing data, and Domingues et al.'s research on integrating multispectral and SAR data for predicting eucalyptus biomass.

Additionally, field surveys may be conducted to collect ground truth data, which can help validate and improve the accuracy of models developed using remote sensing data. For instance, Douwes et al.'s Buffelsdraai Landfill Site Community Reforestation Project might have involved field surveys to gather relevant data.

Publicly available datasets could also serve as sources of raw data for deep learning pipelines. While not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, these datasets can provide valuable information for various applications, including those related to forest biomass estimation and carbon sequestration.
