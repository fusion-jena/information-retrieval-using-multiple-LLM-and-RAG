Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific details about the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that data augmentation was applied to the training dataset. Data augmentation is a strategy that enables practitioners to significantly increase the diversity of data available for training models without actually collecting new data. Common data augmentation techniques include fliping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, shearing, and more. These techniques can help improve the performance and generalization capabilities of deep learning models.
