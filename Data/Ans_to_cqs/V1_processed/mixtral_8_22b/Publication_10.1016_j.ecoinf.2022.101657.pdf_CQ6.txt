Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be taken to improve its performance and efficiency. These steps often include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing any irrelevant, incorrect, or duplicate data from the dataset. It also includes handling missing values if present.

2. Normalization: This step scales numeric columns to a range between 0 and 1. It helps prevent attributes with higher magnitudes from outweighing those with smaller ones during the learning process.

3. Standardization: Also known as z-score normalization, it transforms features to have zero mean and unit variance. This technique is used when the distribution of our input data is Gaussian.

4. Encoding categorical variables: Deep learning models cannot handle non-numeric inputs directly. Therefore, categorical variables need to be converted into numerical form using encoding methods like label encoding or one-hot encoding.

5. Splitting the dataset: The dataset is usually split into three parts - training set, validation set, and test set. The training set is used to fit the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters, and the test set is used to evaluate the final model.

6. Data Augmentation: This technique is used to increase the size of the dataset by applying random (but realistic) transformations such as rotation, zoom, flip, etc. It helps in improving the model's ability to generalize.
