Based on the given information, there isn't any explicit mention of how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, such as using techniques like grid search or random search. However, it does show that different values of the min-batch size were tested, which suggests some form of optimization was performed. Unfortunately, without further details about the specific methods used, it cannot be definitively stated whether grid search, random search, or another method was employed.
