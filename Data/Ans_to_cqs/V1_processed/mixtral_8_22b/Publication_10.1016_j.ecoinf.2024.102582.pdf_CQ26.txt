The paper does not directly discuss addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions some relevant techniques such as stratified sampling and random sampling. In the study, 1800 sample points were generated randomly in the image of the study area for each year, with 300 sample points for each land cover type. These sample points were then divided into training and validation datasets at a 7:3 ratio. Although this is not explicitly stated as a method to address data bias, stratifying the dataset based on land cover types can potentially reduce bias towards any particular land cover type. Additionally, the use of random sampling could also help mitigate potential biases in the dataset. Other common methods to address data bias include oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, but these are not mentioned in the given context.
