Based on the given information, there is no direct mention of how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether they used methods such as grid search or random search. However, these are common techniques used for hyperparameter optimization in machine learning models. Grid search involves trying all possible combinations of hyperparameters within a certain range, while random search randomly selects values within the specified ranges. Other methods include Bayesian Optimization and Gradient-based Optimization. Without further details about the specific model and its implementation, it is not possible to provide a more precise answer.
