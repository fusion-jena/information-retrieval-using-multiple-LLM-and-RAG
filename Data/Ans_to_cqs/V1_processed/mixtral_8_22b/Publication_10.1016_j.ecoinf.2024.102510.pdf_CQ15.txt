The paper mentions the use of an Optimizer in the deep learning pipeline, specifically in the context of training the classifier using the extracted features from pre-trained models. However, the specific optimization technique or algorithm used is not explicitly stated in the given excerpts. Commonly used optimization algorithms in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, RMSprop, and others. These algorithms help minimize the loss function during the training process. Without further information, it cannot be definitively determined which specific optimization technique was employed in this case.
