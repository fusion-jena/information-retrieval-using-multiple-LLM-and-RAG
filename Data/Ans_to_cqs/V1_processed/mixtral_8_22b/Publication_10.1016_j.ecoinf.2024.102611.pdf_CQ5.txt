The papers mentioned in the given context do not explicitly state the specific datasets used in their respective deep learning pipelines. However, some general insights about the data used can be derived from the descriptions. For instance, Gao et al. (2021) worked with RGB plant images, while Barhate et al. (2023) focused on classifying thirty-two plant species. Additionally, Chulif et al. (2023) dealt with detecting diseases in single crop species, and Ganguly et al. (2022) employed the ResNet-50 architecture to capture leaf feature patterns via fusion learning, utilizing three unnamed benchmark datasets. Unfortunately, without explicit mention of the datasets used, it cannot be confirmed if popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet were part of these research works.
