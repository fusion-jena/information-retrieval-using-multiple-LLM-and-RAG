In the given context, it appears that the method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline involves a one-year-long data harvesting campaign using dedicated devices such as cameras and microphones placed in partner farms. This is part of Phase 1 of the project, which has been completed. It can be assumed that these devices collect audio and visual data related to goats and their environment. However, there is no explicit mention of specific types or brands of sensors used for data collection. Additionally, there is no information about any use of surveys or public datasets for gathering data. Therefore, based on the provided context, the only known method for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is through the use of dedicated devices like cameras and microphones installed in partner farms.
