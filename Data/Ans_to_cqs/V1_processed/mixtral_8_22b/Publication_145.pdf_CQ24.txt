To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed. One common approach is to use a fixed random seed value across different runs of the same experiment. This ensures that any random processes involved in the training pipeline, such as weight initialization, data shuffling, or dropout regularization, will yield consistent results each time the code is executed. Another strategy is to perform multiple runs with different random seeds and then average the results to obtain a more robust estimate of performance. Additionally, techniques like k-fold cross-validation can also help mitigate the effects of randomness by ensuring that the entire dataset is used for both training and testing purposes. Finally, it may also be beneficial to carefully tune hyperparameters related to randomness, such as the learning rate or momentum, to minimize their impact on overall performance.
