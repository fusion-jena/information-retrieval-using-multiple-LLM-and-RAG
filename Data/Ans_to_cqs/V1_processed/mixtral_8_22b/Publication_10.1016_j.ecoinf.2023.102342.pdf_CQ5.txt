Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to determine which datasets were used in the deep learning pipeline. However, popular datasets often used in deep learning include MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet. These datasets contain images that can be used to train and test machine learning models. Without further details about the specific project or application, it's impossible to provide a definitive list of datasets used.
