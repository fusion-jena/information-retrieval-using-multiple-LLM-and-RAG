The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the datasets for each species were used in experiments, which could imply some level of diversity in the data. Additionally, the authors suggest using missing value imputation as part of the data preprocessing pipeline, which might help improve the robustness of the model. Nevertheless, without more detailed information regarding the use of techniques such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, it is difficult to definitively state what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
