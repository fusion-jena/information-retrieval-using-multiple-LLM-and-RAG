The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a grid search approach involving cross-validation. This method focuses on minimizing the errors to achieve the best possible performance. Specifically, Grid Search Cross-Validation (GSCV) is used for fine-tuning the hyperparameters. In this process, a series of models are generated during training, each characterized by a different set of hyperparameters. These models are systematically trained and evaluated for their performance through cross-validation. Ultimately, the model with the most superior performance, determined by its optimal hyperparameter combination, is selected.
