Unfortunately, there is no information available regarding the deployment process of any deep learning or machine learning model in the given context. Therefore, it cannot be determined what specific steps were taken to deploy the trained Random Forest model mentioned in the text. Typically, after training a machine learning model such as Random Forest, one might save the model using a method like pickling in Python, then load the saved model into another script or environment for further testing or production use. However, since the details about the deployment process are not provided, we cannot provide a more precise answer.
