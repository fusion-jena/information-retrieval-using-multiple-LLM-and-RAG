The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are indications that suggest potential strategies used to improve the model's performance and robustness.

Firstly, the use of the VnPollenBee dataset implies that diverse data was employed for training and evaluation purposes. A diverse dataset can help improve the model's ability to generalize well across different scenarios and conditions.

Secondly, although not explicitly mentioned, the inclusion of various baseline methods and other state-of-the-art methods suggests that comparative analysis might have been performed to evaluate the proposed method's effectiveness. Cross-validation or stratified splitting could potentially be part of these evaluations, but without further details, it remains speculative.

Lastly, the integration of techniques such as Dropout layers and Global Average Pooling layers in the proposed methods indicates efforts to prevent overfitting and enhance feature extraction. These practices contribute to improving the model's overall performance and generalizability.
