The paper titled "Object Retrieval with Deep Convolutional" by Mohedano et al. (2017) discusses a deep learning approach for object retrieval using deep convolutional networks. However, it does not explicitly mention which specific framework was used to build their deep learning model. Therefore, based solely on this information, we cannot determine whether they used popular frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Further research would be required to ascertain this detail.
