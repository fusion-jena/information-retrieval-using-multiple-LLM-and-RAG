Based on the given context, it appears that the study uses a CentOS Linux operating system with 32 CPUs, where each CPU has 64 processors. However, there is no explicit mention of using any specific hardware resources such as GPUs or TPUs for training the deep learning models. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, we cannot determine which hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model.
