The text does not provide explicit information on the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that citizen programs in biodiversity sciences have accumulated around three hundred thousand finely geolocated plant species observations just in France during the last decade. This suggests that one possible method for collecting raw data is through citizen science initiatives where volunteers contribute to gathering data. Additionally, the mention of national museums, herbaria, and conservatories implies that these institutions may also serve as sources of raw data. Therefore, based on this context, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline might include citizen science initiatives and data from established scientific institutions such as museums and herbaria.
