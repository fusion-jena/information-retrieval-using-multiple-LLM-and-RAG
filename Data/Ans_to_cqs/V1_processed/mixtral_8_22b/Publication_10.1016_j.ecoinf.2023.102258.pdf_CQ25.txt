The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the given context is primarily for automatic acoustic detection and recognition tasks. These tasks include the detection and identification of specific sounds or events within audio recordings, particularly in the field of bioacoustics. For instance, one application is the automatic acoustic detection of birds through deep learning, which aims to classify and identify different bird species based on their unique vocalizations. Another application is the few-shot bioacoustic event detection task, where the goal is to accurately detect and recognize specific bioacoustic events using only a few training examples. Overall, the main objective of these deep learning models is to automate the analysis and interpretation of complex audio data, thereby facilitating research and conservation efforts in various fields, including ecology, wildlife monitoring, and environmental science.
