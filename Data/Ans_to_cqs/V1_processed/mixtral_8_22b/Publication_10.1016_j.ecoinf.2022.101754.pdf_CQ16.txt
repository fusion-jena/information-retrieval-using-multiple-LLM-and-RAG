The paper does not explicitly state the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions that tuning of the hyperparameters was performed on the training set for each split, followed by model training using an optimal setting of the hyperparameters. This suggests that some form of performance metric or convergence criterion may have been used to optimize the hyperparameters and determine the completion of training. Additionally, the use of a training-and-test approach with stratified splitting implies that the performance of the trained models was evaluated on a separate test set after training. Without more explicit information, we can only infer that some combination of performance metrics and convergence criteria were likely used to determine when training was complete.
