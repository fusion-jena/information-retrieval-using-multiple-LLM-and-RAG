The text does not provide specific information on how the hyperparameters were optimized. It only mentions that more details about the hyperparameters are included in the SI Appendix, Preprocessing and Training. Therefore, based on the given context, it cannot be determined which method was used to optimize the hyperparameters, whether it was a grid search, random search, or another optimization technique.
