Based on the given context, it appears that the study uses a MaxEnt model for its analysis. However, there is no explicit mention of specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of this model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.

Nevertheless, some aspects of the methodology suggest efforts towards ensuring the robustness and reliability of the results. For instance, the use of a 30 random test percentage implies that the model was tested on different subsets of the data, which could be seen as a form of cross-validation. Additionally, the fact that the output was analyzed after running the model multiple times (10 replicate runs) also contributes to the reliability of the findings.

However, without more detailed information about the dataset used and the exact process of model validation, it is not possible to definitively state what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
