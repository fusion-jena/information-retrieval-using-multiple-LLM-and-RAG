Based on the given information, it appears that the authors have implemented a Neural Network (NN) model in their pipeline. However, there are no specific mentions of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. Therefore, it can be concluded that the authors have used a general form of Neural Network without specifying any further architectures like CNN, RNN, or Transformers.
