Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no information about the specific data repository link of the deep learning pipeline used by O.P. Babalola and J. Versfeld. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. It would be best to refer to their original paper or contact them directly for this information.
