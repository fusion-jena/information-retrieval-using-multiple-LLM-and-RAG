The given context does not provide information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only discusses the use of machine learning and deep learning models such as bootstrap forest, boosted tree, and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) for forecasting the percent disease incidence of Cotton Leaf Curl Disease (CLCuD). Therefore, I do not have enough information to determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
