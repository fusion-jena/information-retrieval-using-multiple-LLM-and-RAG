The text does not provide specific information about techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some common techniques include stratified splitting, which involves dividing the data into subsets or strata, ensuring each subset has approximately equal representation from all classes. Oversampling is another technique where synthetic samples are created from minority class examples to balance the dataset. Undersampling involves removing instances from the majority class to achieve balanced datasets. Lastly, diverse data collection aims to gather more representative data to reduce bias. These techniques help mitigate data imbalance issues and improve the performance of machine learning algorithms.

Based on the given context, we cannot determine if these techniques were employed in this study. It only mentions that the 'neuralnet' package of R 4.1.2 software was considered for developing a Backpropagation Artificial Neural Network (BP-ANN) model. Additionally, it states that the accuracy of the ANN's training process depends on the quality and quantity of the sample dataset.
