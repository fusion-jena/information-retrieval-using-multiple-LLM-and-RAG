Regularization methods are techniques used in machine learning and deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the noise in the training data instead of generalizing well to unseen data. Two common regularization methods used in deep learning are Dropout and L2 Regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training. This means that their contribution to the activation of downstream neurons is temporally removed on the forward pass and any weight updates are not applied to the neuron on the backward pass. The idea behind dropout is to reduce co-dependencies among neurons, making the network more robust and less likely to overfit.

L2 Regularization, also known as Ridge Regression or Weight Decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of all parameters. By adding this penalty term, we encourage smaller weights, leading to simpler models that generalize better. In other words, it discourages complex models that might fit the training data too closely but perform poorly on new data.

In summary, both Dropout and L2 Regularization are effective ways to combat overfitting in deep learning models. Dropout achieves this by preventing complex co-adaptations on training data, while L2 Regularization encourages smaller weights, resulting in simpler models that generalize better.
