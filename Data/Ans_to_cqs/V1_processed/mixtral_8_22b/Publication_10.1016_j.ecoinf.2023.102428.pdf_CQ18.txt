The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training can be understood by looking at several variables listed in Table 7, such as Start Learning Rate, End Learning Rate, Momentum Factor, Sigmoid Constant, Iterations, Acceptable RMS, Training RMS, Testing RMS, Accuracy Rate, and Skill Measure (%). These variables indicate that the MLP model was trained using a backpropagation algorithm with momentum, where the learning rate decreases from start to end, sigmoid activation function, and a maximum number of iterations set to 10,000. The acceptable RMS value is set to 0.01, while the actual training and testing RMS values are reported as 0.1430 and 0.1446, respectively. Additionally, the accuracy rate and skill measure provide insights into the overall performance of the model on both training and testing datasets.
