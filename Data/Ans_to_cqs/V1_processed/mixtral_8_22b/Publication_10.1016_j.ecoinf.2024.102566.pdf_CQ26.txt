The provided context does not directly discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge about machine learning and deep learning pipelines, several techniques can be employed to mitigate data bias. These include stratified sampling, which ensures that each class is represented proportionally in both training and testing datasets; oversampling, where minority classes are duplicated to balance the dataset; undersampling, where majority classes are reduced to achieve balance; and diverse data collection, which involves gathering data from various sources to ensure representation. It should be noted that these methods may not always be applicable or effective depending on the specific characteristics of the dataset and problem at hand.
