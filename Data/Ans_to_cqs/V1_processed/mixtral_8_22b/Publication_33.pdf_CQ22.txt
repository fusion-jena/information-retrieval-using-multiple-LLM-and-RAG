The primary metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this context is accuracy. Accuracy is calculated as the ratio of correctly classified instances out of the total number of instances. In Table 2, the accuracy of the models is presented before and after post-processing, along with the three different goals (G1, G2, and G3). Additionally, the paper mentions the misclassification rate, which can be considered another important metric. However, it does not explicitly mention other common evaluation metrics such as precision or recall.
