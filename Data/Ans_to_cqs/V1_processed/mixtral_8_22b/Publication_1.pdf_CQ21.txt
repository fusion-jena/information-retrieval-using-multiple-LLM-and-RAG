The text does not provide explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, we can infer some possible steps based on the given context. After training deep learning (DL) models using stochastic gradient descent, these models are used to classify and detect species or events of interest in the survey data. The models output the relative probability that an event belongs to a specific data class, which could be a particular species or event.

The results are then sorted according to this probability, allowing analysts to focus on the most relevant data samples first. For images, the postprocessing involves cropping around the object of interest, contrast enhancement, and displaying consecutive frame differences. For audio data, 2D spectrograms are generated to give a visual representation of the sound clips. Distinct sounds have different spectrograms, making it easier for analysts to identify sounds of interest when presented with multiple sounds simultaneously. Additionally, analysts can listen to the audio corresponding to each spectrogram and view more temporal context around it to aid in decision-making during the auditing process.

While the text does not mention saliency maps, metrics calculations, or confusion matrices explicitly, these techniques could potentially be employed as part of the postprocessing steps. Saliency maps could be used to highlight important features within the images or spectrograms that contribute to the classification decisions made by the models. Metrics calculations would involve evaluating the performance of the trained models using various evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc. Lastly, confusion matrices could be created to visualize the performance of the models across all classes, showing true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
