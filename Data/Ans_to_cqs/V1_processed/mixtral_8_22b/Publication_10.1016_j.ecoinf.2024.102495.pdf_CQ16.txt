Based on the given information, it appears that the model was trained using a fixed number of epochs and batch size, which were set to 10 and 32, respectively. However, there is no explicit mention of any specific criteria used to determine when the training should stop or if it has reached completion. Typically, common criteria used to determine when training is complete include reaching a certain number of epochs, achieving a desired level of accuracy or loss value, or observing a plateau in the validation loss. In this case, since only the number of epochs is mentioned, we can infer that the training might have been stopped after completing the specified number of epochs. However, without further details about the actual implementation or results, it cannot be definitively stated what criteria were used to determine when training was complete.
