The given context does not explicitly mention any specific deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch being used to build the deep learning models. However, it mentions two modeling frameworks: model-assisted framework and hierarchical modeling. The model-assisted framework is exemplified by St√•hl et al. (2016), while hierarchical modeling is demonstrated by Saarela et al. (2016, 2018). These frameworks could potentially involve using deep learning techniques, but without further context, we cannot definitively state whether they employ TensorFlow, PyTorch, or another deep learning framework.
