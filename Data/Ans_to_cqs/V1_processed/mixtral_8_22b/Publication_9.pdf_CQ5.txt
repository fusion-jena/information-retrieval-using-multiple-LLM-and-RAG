The paper mentions the use of ImageNet dataset, which consists of over 14 million high-resolution images across nearly 22,000 categories. It is often used as a starting point for recognition tasks with deep learning. However, it should be noted that the utility of pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is constrained by how relevant the novel input data are to the data the CNN was originally trained on. Therefore, while ImageNet may serve as a useful initial dataset, additional or alternative datasets may need to be incorporated depending on the specific application.
