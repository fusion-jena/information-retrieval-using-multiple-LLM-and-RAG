Unfortunately, there is no information available regarding the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in this study. It appears that the focus of this research is on coastal water bathymetry for critical zone management using regression tree models from Gaofen-6 imagery rather than a deep learning approach. Therefore, it can be assumed that a deep learning pipeline may not have been utilized in this particular study.
