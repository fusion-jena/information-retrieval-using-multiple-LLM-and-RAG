In this study, the authors use two main metrics to evaluate the performance of their deep learning model: total accuracy and user's accuracy. Total accuracy refers to the proportion of correctly classified pixels out of all pixels in the dataset, while user's accuracy measures how well the classifier performs for a particular class. Additionally, they also report producer's accuracy, which reflects the probability that a pixel belonging to a certain class will be correctly identified by the classifier. These metrics are calculated from confusion matrices, which compare the predicted classes against the actual classes. It should be noted that these metrics can be influenced by factors such as the size of the dataset and the distribution of classes within it.
