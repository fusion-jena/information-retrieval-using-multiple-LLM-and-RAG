The text does not provide explicit information about the specific preprocessing steps used before training the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the input images were resized to 256 Ã— 256 pixels and augmented using random rotations, flips, and crops. These techniques could be considered part of the preprocessing stage. Normalization, scaling, and cleaning might also have been applied but are not explicitly mentioned in this context.
