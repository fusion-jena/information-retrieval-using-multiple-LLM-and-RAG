Based on the given context, it appears there isn't any direct information about the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models mentioned in the text. However, considering the general practices in evaluating deep learning models, common metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, and confusion matrix. These metrics help assess different aspects of the model's performance, including its ability to correctly classify positive and negative instances, balance between false positives and negatives, and overall correct predictions. Given the focus of the study on estimating Chl-a concentrations using ML techniques, it can be assumed that similar evaluation methods might have been employed. Nonetheless, without explicit mention in the provided context, we cannot confirm which exact metrics were utilized.
