The text does not provide specific details about how the trained deep learning model was deployed after the training phase. However, generally speaking, once a deep learning model is trained, it needs to be serialized and saved so that it can be loaded later for making predictions. Common ways to serialize a model include saving its weights, architecture, and hyperparameters in formats such as.h5,.pkl, or.pt files. Once the model is serialized, it can be deployed on various platforms depending on the use case. For instance, if the model is intended for real-time prediction, it could be deployed on edge devices such as Raspberry Pi or NVIDIA Jetson. Alternatively, if the model is meant for batch processing, it could be deployed on cloud platforms such as AWS Sagemaker, Google Cloud ML Engine, or Azure Machine Learning Studio. Again, the text does not specify any particular platform or deployment strategy, so this response provides a general overview of possible approaches.
