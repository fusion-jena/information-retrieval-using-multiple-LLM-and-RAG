Based on the given information, it appears that the authors have employed several strategies to monitor the performance of their models during training. These include performing hyperparameter searches for both classification and regression models to find the appropriate level of regularization. They also evaluated various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, along with using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as an alternative performance metric. Additionally, they conducted feature ablations to understand the impact of specific features on the overall performance of the models. However, there isn't any explicit mention of a specific monitoring strategy or tool being utilized throughout the training process.
