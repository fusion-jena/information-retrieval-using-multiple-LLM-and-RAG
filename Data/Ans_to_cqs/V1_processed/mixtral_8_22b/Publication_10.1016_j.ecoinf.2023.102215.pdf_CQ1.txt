The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific method or source for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the authors might have used publicly available datasets or collected their own dataset using sensors or other means based on the nature of their research. For instance, they could have used sensors like cameras to capture images for tasks such as image classification, object detection, or semantic segmentation. They may also have used existing datasets like ImageNet, COCO, or Pascal VOC for training and evaluating their models. Nevertheless, without explicit information about the data collection process, this remains speculative.
