The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it mentions two studies that utilize deep learning models for their respective tasks.

In the study by Kumar and Gorai (2023), they compare the performance of a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) and a deep neural network (DNN) for land use/land cover classifications of mining regions using fused multi-sensor satellite data. This suggests that either DCNN or DNN could be employed in the pipeline, depending on the task requirements.

Additionally, Meng et al. (2024) discuss the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for classifying inland lake water quality levels based on Sentinel-2 images. This indicates that CNNs might also be considered when designing the pipeline.

However, without more detailed information regarding the specific pipeline mentioned in the query, we cannot definitively state whether a CNN, RNN, Transformer, or another deep learning model would be most suitable.
