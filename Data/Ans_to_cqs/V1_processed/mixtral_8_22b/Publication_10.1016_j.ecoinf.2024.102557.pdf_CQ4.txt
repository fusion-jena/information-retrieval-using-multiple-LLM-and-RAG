The papers cited do not directly discuss specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, and shifting images. These techniques help improve model performance and prevent overfitting by increasing the amount of training data available. It is important to note that the choice of data augmentation technique depends on the nature of the dataset and the problem being addressed. For instance, flipping or rotation might not be suitable for datasets where orientation matters, while scaling can introduce distortions if not done carefully. Therefore, it is essential to consider the characteristics of the dataset before applying any data augmentation technique.
