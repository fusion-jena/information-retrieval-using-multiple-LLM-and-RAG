Regularization methods are techniques used to prevent overfitting in machine learning and deep learning models. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the noise in the training data instead of generalizing patterns, leading to poor performance on unseen data. Two common regularization methods mentioned in the given context are Dropout and L2 Regularization.

Dropout is a technique introduced by Srivastava et al. (2014) to improve the robustness of deep learning models against overfitting. During training, Dropout randomly sets a fraction of input units to 0 at each update, effectively preventing complex co-adaptations among them. This helps reduce interdependent learning among neurons and encourages the network to learn more robust features.

L2 Regularization, also known as Ridge Regression or Weight Decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. By adding this penalty, the algorithm tries to find smaller weights that still provide good predictive accuracy. Smaller weights lead to simpler models, reducing the risk of overfitting.

These regularization methods can be combined or used independently depending on the specific requirements of the problem and the characteristics of the dataset. Other regularization methods not explicitly mentioned in the given context but commonly used in deep learning pipelines include L1 Regularization (also known as Lasso Regression), Early Stopping, and Batch Normalization.
