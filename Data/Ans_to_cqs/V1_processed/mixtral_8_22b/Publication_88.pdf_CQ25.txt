The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, it can be inferred from the information provided that the model is being used for classification tasks. This is evident from the use of the term 'binary cross-entropy', which is typically employed as a loss function for binary classification problems. Furthermore, the mention of the'softmax layer' at the end of the EF network architecture also suggests that the model is designed for multi-class classification tasks. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model is primarily intended for classification purposes, specifically for distinguishing between 'deforestation' and 'no-deforestation' classes.
