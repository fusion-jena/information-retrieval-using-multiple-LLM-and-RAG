The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics such as receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, area under the curve (AUC), overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and false positive rate. These metrics are calculated using Python packages like sklearn and plotted using matplotlib. Specifically, ROC curve and AUC are used to measure the discriminating ability of the classifier, while overall accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of total predictions made. Sensitivity, also known as true positive rate or recall, measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified as such. On the other hand, specificity, also known as true negative rate, measures the proportion of actual negatives that are correctly identified as such. False positive rate, also known as fallout or probability of false alarm, measures the proportion of false positives among all predicted positives.
