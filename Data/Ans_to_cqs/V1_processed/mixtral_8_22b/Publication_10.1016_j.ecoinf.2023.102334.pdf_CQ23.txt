The text does not provide explicit details about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are hints suggesting potential strategies employed. Firstly, the authors mention using two types of data, implying a diverse dataset. Secondly, they discuss the use of L2 regularization, which helps prevent overfitting and improves the model's ability to generalize. Lastly, while not explicitly mentioned, techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting could have been utilized during training and testing phases to further enhance the model's performance and generalizability.
