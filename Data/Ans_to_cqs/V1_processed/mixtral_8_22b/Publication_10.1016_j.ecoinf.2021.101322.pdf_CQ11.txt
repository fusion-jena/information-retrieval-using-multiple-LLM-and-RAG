Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide a direct link to the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in this study. However, it can be noted that the salmon scale image datasets are mentioned with DOIs (Digital Object Identifiers), which can be used to access the respective datasets. The first dataset has the DOI: 10.21335/NMDC-1050865887, while the second one has the DOI: 10.21. Additionally, the pre-trained network weights used were from EfficientNet-B4, which can be found at <https://github.com/qubvel/efficientnet/blob/master/efficientnet/weights.py>. It would be best to refer to the original research article or contact the corresponding author for more specific details regarding the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline.
