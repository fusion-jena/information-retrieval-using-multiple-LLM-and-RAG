Based on the given information, there is no mention of any cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform being used to deploy the deep learning model. The only tools mentioned are the 'Full-archive search endpoint' of the Twitter API and the 'twarc2' library for handling the returned data in JSON format. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
