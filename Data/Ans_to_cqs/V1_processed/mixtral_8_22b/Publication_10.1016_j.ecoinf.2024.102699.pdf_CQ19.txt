Unfortunately, there isn't enough context provided to determine which specific framework was used to build the deep learning models mentioned in this text. However, popular frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch are commonly used for building deep learning models like those described here. Without additional context, I cannot provide a definitive answer.
