The text does not provide explicit information about the specific evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the deep learning model. However, common metrics used in classification tasks include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC). Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of total instances, while precision indicates the ratio of true positive predictions to the sum of true positives and false positives. Recall calculates the fraction of relevant instances retrieved out of the total number of relevant instances. The F1 score combines precision and recall into a single metric, providing a more balanced view of the model's performance. Lastly, AUC-ROC represents the degree or measure of separability between classes, indicating how well the model can distinguish between them. Without further details, it cannot be determined which of these metrics were utilized in evaluating the deep learning model described in the given context.
