The given context does not provide explicit information on the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. However, it mentions that in machine learning, when data is abundant, a common approach is to randomly divide the full dataset used for modeling into three parts: a training set, a validation set, and a test set. This implies that the raw data could be collected through various means and then divided for use in different stages of the machine learning process. Unfortunately, without more specific details about the source of the initial dataset, it is impossible to definitively state which methods were used for its collection.
