After the model training, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the project. Some common postprocessing steps include:

1. Model Evaluation: After training, it is essential to evaluate the performance of the model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc. These metrics help determine how well the model performs on unseen data.
2. Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the predictions made by the model compared to the actual values. It provides insights into the types of errors made by the model and helps identify areas where the model needs improvement.
3. Saliency Maps: Saliency maps highlight the regions of an input image that contribute the most to the output prediction. They provide insight into what features the model focuses on while making its predictions.
4. Visualization Techniques: Various visualization techniques like t-SNE, PCA, etc., can be used to understand the high dimensional representations learned by the model.
5. Hyperparameter Tuning: Postprocessing also involves tuning hyperparameters to improve the model's performance further. Grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, etc., are some commonly used methods for hyperparameter tuning.

Based on the given context, it appears that the researchers have evaluated the performance of their model using various metrics such as accuracy, loss, and classification error. They have also created a scaled confusion matrix to visualize the classification error. However, there is no mention of saliency maps or any other visualization techniques being used. Additionally, it is unclear whether any hyperparameter tuning was done post-training.
