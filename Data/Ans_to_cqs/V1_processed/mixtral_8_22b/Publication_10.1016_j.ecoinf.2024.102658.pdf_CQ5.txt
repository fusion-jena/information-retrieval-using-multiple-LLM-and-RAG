Based on the given context, it does not provide information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it mentions that the study uses climate data comprising the 27 climate extremes indices defined by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI) and the 19 bioclimatic variables from WorldClim. These datasets are used to build species distribution models (SDMs) using machine learning techniques. Therefore, the datasets used in this study are related to climate data rather than commonly used image datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
