Based on the given context, it appears that the authors did not use any pre-existing datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet for their deep learning pipeline. Instead, due to the lack of existing quality data, they decided to create their own dataset specifically tailored for their project. Although the exact nature of the custom dataset isn't explicitly mentioned, it can be inferred from the keywords that the dataset likely contains aerial images of ocean objects for classification and object detection purposes using the YOLOv3 model architecture.
