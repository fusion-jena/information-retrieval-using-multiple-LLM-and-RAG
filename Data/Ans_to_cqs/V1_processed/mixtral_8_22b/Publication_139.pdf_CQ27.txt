After the neural network was trained and validated using the assembled training database consisting of over 40k images of biophony, anthropophony, and geophony, predictions for the entire unvalidated recording period were generated. For each of the five training folds, a single prediction was made for every 8-second interval throughout the year. These predictions were then averaged together to form a single prediction record. To simplify the data further, these 8-second interval predictions were aggregated into hourly prediction records, indicating the number of times each specific sound stimulus was predicted per hour. This record was normalized based on the actual number of 8-second intervals recorded during that hour to account for any missing audio data that might cause an artificially low prediction record.
