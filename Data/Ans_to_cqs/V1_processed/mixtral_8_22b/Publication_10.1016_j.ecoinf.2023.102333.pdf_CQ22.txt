Three metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model: Overall Accuracy (OA), Producer Accuracy (PA), and User Accuracy (UA). Overall accuracy is the ratio of the sum of correctly classified pixels to the total number of pixels in the test dataset. Producer accuracy refers to the accuracy from the point of view of the mapmaker, while user's accuracy represents the probability that a pixel classified in each category corresponds to the actual category on the ground. Additionally, the kappa coefficient of agreement is used to evaluate the performance of the final DNN model. Furthermore, errors of omission and commission are calculated for each land cover/land use class to better assess the performance of the DNN model for each class.
