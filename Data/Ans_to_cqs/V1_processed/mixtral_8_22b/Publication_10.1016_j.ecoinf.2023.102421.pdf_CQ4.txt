Unfortunately, there isn't any information about data augmentation techniques applied in this case since it focuses on a machine learning approach rather than a deep learning one. Therefore, I cannot provide details regarding flipping, rotating, scaling, or other data augmentation techniques related to deep learning pipelines. Instead, the given text discusses the use of Bayesian optimizers and Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TDO) to tune the hyperparameters of XGBoost and LightGBM algorithms for estimating aboveground biomass (AGB). These methods help improve predictive efficiency, manage large datasets, and decrease training times.
