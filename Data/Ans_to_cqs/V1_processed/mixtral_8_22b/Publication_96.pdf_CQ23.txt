To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, a diverse dataset was used, consisting of Landsat 8 imagery with eleven spectral bands and varying spatial resolutions. This diversity helped capture different aspects of the burned areas, improving the model's performance across various scenarios. Secondly, the dataset was split into two subsets: one for training (70%) and another for testing (30%). This allowed for estimating the ability of the DNN algorithm to accurately map burned areas in the study area. Lastly, an additional accuracy assessment using validation points was conducted to further evaluate the model's performance. These steps collectively contributed to enhancing the robustness and applicability of the deep learning model.
