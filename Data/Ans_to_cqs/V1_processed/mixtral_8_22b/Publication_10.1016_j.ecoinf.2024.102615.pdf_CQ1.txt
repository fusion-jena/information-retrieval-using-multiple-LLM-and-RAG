The context does not provide specific information about the method used for collecting raw data in this particular study. However, it can be inferred from the context that the raw data collected is related to spectral reflectance data, possibly obtained using remote sensing techniques or spectrometers. This is evident from the mention of spectral curves of soil samples and the use of neural networks in remote sensing. Additionally, the reference to papers discussing the use of satellite images such as Landsat 8, Sentinel-2, and Gaofen-2 further supports this inference. Therefore, while the exact method of data collection is not specified, it can be assumed that remote sensing techniques were employed to gather spectral reflectance data for this study.
