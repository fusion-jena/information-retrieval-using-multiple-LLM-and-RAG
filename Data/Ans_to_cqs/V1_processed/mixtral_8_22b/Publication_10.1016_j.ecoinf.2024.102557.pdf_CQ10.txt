Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to provide the exact code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The sources mentioned discuss various topics like applications of deep learning in ecology, individual-scale variation, species-scale differences, and the use of random forest models in understanding relationships between species-specific productivity and environmental conditions. However, none of them directly mention or provide links to any specific deep learning pipelines or repositories. Therefore, I am unable to provide the requested information.
