In the given context, several optimization techniques are mentioned for different deep learning pipelines.

For the PConv networks, the Adam optimizer is employed with a learning rate of 0.0002. Similarly, the Pix2Pix networks also use the Adam optimizer but with a lower learning rate of 9e-5.

When it comes to the classification networks, they too utilize the Adam optimizer. However, their learning rates differ depending on the specific task. For instance, the learning rate for the pre-trained networks is 0.03, while the networks trained from scratch use a learning rate of 0.0002.

Additionally, the context mentions that the models were optimized using the Adam optimizer, which is a popular choice due to its ability to adaptively adjust the learning rate during training. It combines the advantages of AdaGrad and RMSProp, making it suitable for problems with sparse gradients or noisy data.

Therefore, the primary optimization technique applied in these deep learning pipelines is the Adam optimizer, with varying learning rates tailored to each specific application.
