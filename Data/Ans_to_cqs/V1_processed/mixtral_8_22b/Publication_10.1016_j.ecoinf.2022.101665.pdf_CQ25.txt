The given context does not provide explicit information about the purpose or type of any deep learning model. However, it discusses various aspects related to machine learning and geospatial modeling. It mentions the use of machine learning techniques when data is abundant, where datasets can be divided into three parts - training, validation, and test sets. These sets help in fitting models, estimating prediction errors, and assessing the accuracy of the final model respectively.

In terms of deep learning models, they could serve different purposes depending on their application. For instance, a deep learning model might be designed for image classification tasks, where it would categorize images into predefined classes based on learned features. Alternatively, it could be employed for object detection, identifying and localizing objects within an image. Another potential application is semantic segmentation, which involves assigning each pixel in an image to a particular class, effectively creating a detailed understanding of the scene.

However, without more specific details regarding the deep learning model mentioned in the original text, we cannot definitively state its purpose.
