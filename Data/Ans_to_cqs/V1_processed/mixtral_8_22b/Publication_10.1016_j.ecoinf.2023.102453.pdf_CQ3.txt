Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, I can share some common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines for image classification tasks. These include:

1. Bounding Box Annotation: This technique involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects within an image to identify their location. It is commonly used for object detection tasks.

2. Semantic Segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image with a class label. It is often used for scene understanding tasks where the goal is to understand the overall layout of a scene.

3. Instance Segmentation: This technique combines semantic segmentation and object detection by identifying individual instances of objects within an image and assigning them unique labels.

4. Polygon Annotation: This technique involves manually tracing the outline of objects within an image using polygons. It is useful when dealing with irregularly shaped objects.

5. Landmark Annotation: This technique involves marking specific points on an object within an image. It is often used for facial recognition tasks.

6. Image Classification: This technique involves assigning a single label to an entire image. It is commonly used for categorizing images into different classes.
