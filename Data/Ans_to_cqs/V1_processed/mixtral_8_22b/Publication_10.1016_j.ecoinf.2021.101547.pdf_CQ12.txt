The deep learning model used in this pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, they use the freely available residual network called ResNet-50, which was pre-trained on more than one million images from the ImageNet database. This network has been trained to recognize 1000 categories of common objects, including various animals. The authors modified the pre-trained ResNet-50 network by replacing the last learnable layer with a custom learnable layer defining their two classes of interest and replaced the final classification layer with a custom weighted classification layer to assign varying weights to the classes. They also froze the'stem' of the network, corresponding to the first four layers before any convolution occurs. All deep learning-related operations were carried out in MATLAB 2020b equipped with the Image Processing, Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Parallel Computing toolboxes.
