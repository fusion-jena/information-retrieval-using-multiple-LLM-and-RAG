Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of a specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does discuss the use of Bayesian Optimization, which is often employed to optimize hyperparameters in machine learning models like the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model mentioned here. This technique could potentially be utilized to improve the model's performance during training. Additionally, the paper mentions using SHAP values, which help explain the importance of each feature in the model's predictions. These values might also aid in monitoring the model's performance during training indirectly, but this isn't explicitly stated in the provided context.
