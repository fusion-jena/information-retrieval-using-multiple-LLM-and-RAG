The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that some form of labeling or classification was performed during the database construction phase, where five training datasets were created with examples of images having different levels of tree cover. This suggests that the images might have been labeled according to their respective tree cover levels. Additionally, the use of transfer learning and data augmentation techniques during the training phase indicates that pre-existing models and additional synthetic data may have been employed to improve the accuracy of the CNN-based models. Nevertheless, without more detailed information regarding the actual data annotation methods applied, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, it is difficult to definitively state which techniques were utilized in this particular case.
