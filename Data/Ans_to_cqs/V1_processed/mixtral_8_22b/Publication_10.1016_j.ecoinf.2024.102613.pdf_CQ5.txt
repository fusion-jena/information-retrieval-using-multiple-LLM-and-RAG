The given context does not provide specific details about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that traditional data management systems are inadequate to handle the volume, velocity, and variety of data generated by sensors and IoT devices in smart farming applications. It also discusses the use of machine learning and deep learning techniques for analyzing this data. Therefore, while we cannot identify the exact datasets used, they likely involve large volumes of diverse agricultural data collected through IoT devices and sensors.

Regarding general deep learning pipelines, popular datasets include MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet. These datasets have been widely used for various computer vision tasks like image classification, object recognition, and segmentation. MNIST consists of handwritten digit images, CIFAR contains small natural images categorized into ten classes, and ImageNet is a vast dataset with over 14 million labeled high-resolution images belonging to around 22,000 categories.
