The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, or validation sets. However, it can be inferred from general machine learning practices that common methods include random splitting, stratified sampling, or time series based splits depending on the nature of the dataset. In this particular case, the text mentions performing leave-one-out cross-validation, which suggests that the authors might have used a similar approach to divide their data. This technique involves iteratively leaving out one observation from the dataset, training the model on the remaining observations, and then testing its performance on the left-out observation.
