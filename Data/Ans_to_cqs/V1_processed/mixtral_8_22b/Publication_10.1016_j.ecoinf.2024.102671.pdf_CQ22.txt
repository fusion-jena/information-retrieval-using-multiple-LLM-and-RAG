The given context does not provide specific details about the evaluation metrics used for the deep learning model. However, common metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, and area under the curve (AUC). Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of total predictions made. Precision indicates the ratio of true positive predictions to all positive predictions. Recall calculates the fraction of relevant instances retrieved from the dataset. The F1 score combines both precision and recall into a single metric. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate, while the area under the curve (AUC) provides a measure of separability between classes. These metrics can be applied based on the requirements and objectives of the specific task or application.
