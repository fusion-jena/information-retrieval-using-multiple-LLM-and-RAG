Unfortunately, there isn't any explicit information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available in the given context. It could be possible that the authors did not provide their code publicly or they might have mentioned it elsewhere outside of the provided text. Therefore, I cannot determine the exact location of the code repository.
