Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to determine the exact process used to deploy the trained deep learning model. Typically, after training a deep learning model, it can be serialized into a format such as ONNX or TensorFlow Lite, depending on the platform chosen for deployment. Common platforms include cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure, edge devices like NVIDIA Jetson or Raspberry Pi, or mobile devices running Android or iOS. Without specific details about the model architecture, target hardware, or software stack, it's impossible to give a precise answer regarding the deployment process.
