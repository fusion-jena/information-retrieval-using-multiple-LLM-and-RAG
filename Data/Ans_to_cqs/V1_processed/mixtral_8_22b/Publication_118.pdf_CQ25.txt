The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, it can be inferred that the model is being used for unsupervised feature extraction, specifically through the use of an auto-encoder. Auto-encoders are typically used for dimensionality reduction or denoising purposes, but they can also be used for generating new data samples or anomaly detection. In this case, the authors mention that they are testing the feasibility of using an auto-encoder generated feature representation for ecoacoustic analysis. Therefore, it can be assumed that the goal of the deep learning model is to extract meaningful features from the audio spectrograms that can be used for further analysis in the field of soundscape ecology.
