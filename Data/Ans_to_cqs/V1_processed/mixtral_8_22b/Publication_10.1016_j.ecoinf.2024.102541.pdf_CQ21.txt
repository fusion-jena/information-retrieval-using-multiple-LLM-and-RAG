The text does not provide explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it can be inferred from the given context that some possible postprocessing steps might include generating ground-truth annotations, creating histograms to show class distribution, and producing various visualizations such as label, mask, and heat maps. These processes would offer comprehensive insights into the dataset's structure and diversity. Additionally, the text mentions metrics like mAP@0.5:0.95 (%), which suggests that calculating performance metrics could also be part of the postprocessing steps. Unfortunately, there is no mention of saliency maps or confusion matrices in the provided context.
