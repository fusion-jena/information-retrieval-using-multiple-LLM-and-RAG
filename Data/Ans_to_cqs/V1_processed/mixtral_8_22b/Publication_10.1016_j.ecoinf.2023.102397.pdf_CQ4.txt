The text does not provide explicit information about the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on common practices in deep learning, some possible data augmentation techniques could include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, or changing brightness/contrast levels. These techniques help increase the amount of training data available and prevent overfitting. Without further details, it is impossible to determine exactly which techniques were employed in this case.
