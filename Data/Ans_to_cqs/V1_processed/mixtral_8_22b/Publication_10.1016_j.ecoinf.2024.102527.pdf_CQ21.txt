The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, based on common practices in machine learning and deep learning, some possible postprocessing steps could include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., creating confusion matrices, and performing statistical tests like binomial tests to compare the performance of different models or strategies. In this case, the context mentions that the authors used binomial tests to determine if there is a significant difference between the best-performing transfer strategy and other transfer strategies. Additionally, they evaluated the performance of their models by testing them on a separate test set and tracking the model training process using a validation set. Therefore, it can be inferred that these might be some of the postprocessing steps taken by the authors after the model training phase.
