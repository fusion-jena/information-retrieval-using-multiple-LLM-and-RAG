The given context does not provide information on the specific hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer used in a deep learning model. Instead, it discusses the use of a Weighted Time-domain Hidden Markov Model (WT-HMM) for classifying blue whale vocalizations and noise signals. The WT-HMM consists of eight states and four mixture weights, where states 1-4 represent one HMM and states 5-8 represent another HMM. The emission distribution parameters, B, include the mean, covariance matrix, and mixture weight, which are obtained using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, specifically the Baum-Welch (BM) algorithm. The B parameters are initialized using a sequential combination of the k-means clustering algorithm and the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). However, no explicit mention of deep learning hyperparameters like learning rate or optimizer was found in the provided context.
