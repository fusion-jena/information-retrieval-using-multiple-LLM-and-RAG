The text does not provide specific information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, it mentions that a feedback mechanism involving users is employed to improve the system's performance. This process, called active learning, involves presenting certain images to humans for annotation, then using those annotated images to iteratively train a classifier. While this approach helps minimize manual labeling efforts, it doesn't explicitly mention methods like grid search or random search for hyperparameter tuning. Therefore, based on the given context, we cannot determine the exact method used for optimizing the model's hyperparameters.
