The given information does not provide details about the specific platform used for deploying the deep learning models. The data only includes various performance metrics such as R, RMSE, MAPE, and parameters related to different models like CNN-BiGRU, RVFL, KELM, CNN-BiRNN, etc. However, it is important to note that platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform are commonly used for deploying deep learning models. Without additional context, I cannot determine which platform was utilized in this case.
