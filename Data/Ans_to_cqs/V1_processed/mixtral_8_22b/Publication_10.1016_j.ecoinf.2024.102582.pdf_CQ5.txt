The text does not provide explicit information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+, and Landsat 8 OLI images for mapping the spatial distribution of mangrove forests. These images are part of the Historic Satellite Data Archive of Google Earth Engine (GEE). The study also uses approximately three to six annual images for the southeastern coastal zone of China, with a 30-meter spatial resolution and a 16-day revisit time. Therefore, while we cannot identify the exact datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, we can infer that they likely involve these Landsat images obtained through GEE.
