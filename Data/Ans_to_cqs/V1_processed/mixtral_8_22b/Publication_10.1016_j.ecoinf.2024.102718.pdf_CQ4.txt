The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include modifications in brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue. Additionally, random horizontal and vertical flips, and random rotations up to thirty degrees were also used. Gaussian noise was also incorporated to improve the robustness of the model in different conditions.
