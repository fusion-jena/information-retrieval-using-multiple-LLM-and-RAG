Based on the given information, the training process was stopped after 6900 iterations. This suggests that the criterion used to determine when training is complete is based on a fixed number of iterations rather than other common criteria such as validation loss plateau or early stopping. However, without additional context, we cannot definitively confirm this interpretation.
