The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, it mentions two indicators used to evaluate the effectiveness of each model in correcting the sampling bias. These indicators are the Area Under Curve (AUC) and Delta Discrimination (Î”D), which can be interpreted as measures of model performance and robustness. Additionally, the text discusses the use of environmental covariates and the importance of accurately reflecting the efficacy of bias correction. While these aspects do not directly address the question of ensuring the generalizability of a deep learning model, they suggest that the authors considered factors related to model performance and bias correction when evaluating their models.
