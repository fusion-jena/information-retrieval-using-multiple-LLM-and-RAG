The text does not provide specific details about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of satellite image data from sources such as Landsat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for land use and land cover (LULC) mapping. It also describes the process of generating training datasets by identifying and selecting eight LULC classes based on MODIS Global Land Cover products. Therefore, it can be inferred that the dataset used in this case is likely related to satellite imagery and land cover classification.
