The paper does not provide explicit information on the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of ground-truth data for wetland mapping, which suggests that some form of image labeling was employed. The authors also discuss the challenges associated with acquiring sufficient labeled data due to its high cost and time consumption. Given these constraints, it is likely that the researchers used efficient annotation methods like bounding boxes or polygons to delineate areas of interest within the images. Instance segmentation could also have been applied if individual objects needed to be identified separately within each class. Nevertheless, without further details from the study, one cannot definitively determine the exact annotation techniques used.
