None of the given context directly addresses the handling of randomness in the deep learning pipeline or the use of random seed values. However, one strategy commonly used to manage randomness in deep learning pipelines is setting a fixed random seed value. By doing so, researchers can ensure reproducibility of their results across multiple runs of the same experiment. Another approach is to perform multiple runs with different random seeds and report the mean and standard deviation of the performance metrics. This helps to understand the variability introduced by the random components in the pipeline.

The text discusses the improved generator structure of the DR-ACGAN model, which includes four residual structures and channel and spatial attention layers. It also mentions Lipschitz continuity but does not provide information about managing randomness in the deep learning pipeline or using random seed values.
