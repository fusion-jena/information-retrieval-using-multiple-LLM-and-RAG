The text does not provide explicit information regarding the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, based on common machine learning practices, it can be inferred that the researchers might have employed techniques such as cross-validation or monitoring metrics like loss and accuracy on both the training and validation sets. Additionally, they may have utilized early stopping to prevent overfitting and ensure optimal model performance. Nevertheless, these assumptions cannot be confirmed without further details from the authors.
