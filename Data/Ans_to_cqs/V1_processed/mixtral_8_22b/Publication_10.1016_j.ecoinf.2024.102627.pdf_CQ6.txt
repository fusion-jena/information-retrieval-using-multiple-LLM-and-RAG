The given context does not provide explicit information about any specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model. However, based on general practices in machine learning and deep learning, some commonly used preprocessing techniques could have been applied. These may include data normalization, where the values of different features are scaled to a similar range; data cleaning, which involves handling missing values, outliers, or incorrect entries; and feature engineering, where additional relevant features are derived from existing ones to improve model performance. In this case, the authors mention using a large environmental context around each observation, including WorldClim2 bioclimatic variables, Soilgrids pedological variables, human footprint rasters, terrestrial ecoregions of the world, and the observation location (longitude and latitude). This suggests that they might have performed some form of feature extraction or selection during their preprocessing stage.
