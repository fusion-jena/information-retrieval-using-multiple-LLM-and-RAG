The text does not explicitly mention the specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, it cannot be determined which data repository hosts the deep learning pipeline. It could potentially be hosted on any of the mentioned platforms (Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF) or another platform entirely. Further research would be required to determine the exact location of the deep learning pipeline's data repository.
