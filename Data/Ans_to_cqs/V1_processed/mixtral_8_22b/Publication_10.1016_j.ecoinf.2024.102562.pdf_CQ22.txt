Two standard metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model: mean average precision (mAP) and recall. Mean average precision is the average of the weighted mean of precision of each class, while recall is the percentage of correct detected objects out of all the correct targets. In other words, recall represents the capability of detecting all instances of the target class, and mean average precision shows how much we can trust the identified result.
