In the given context, there is no mention of any specific data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. However, some common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, shearing, and translating images. These techniques help increase the amount of training data available and improve model performance by introducing variations into the input data. It should be noted that the choice of data augmentation technique depends on the nature of the problem being solved and the characteristics of the input data.

This study focuses on understanding the prevailing data collection trends and laying the groundwork for potential corrective measures to address described biases related to scales associated with data collection. The authors have applied a series of filters to enhance the quality and reliability of their information, including removing duplicates and retaining only relevant columns such as scientific name, family, year, longitude, and latitude. They have also removed records with missing values and kept only taxonomic information down to the species level. While these steps do not directly involve data augmentation techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines, they contribute to improving the overall quality and accuracy of the dataset.
