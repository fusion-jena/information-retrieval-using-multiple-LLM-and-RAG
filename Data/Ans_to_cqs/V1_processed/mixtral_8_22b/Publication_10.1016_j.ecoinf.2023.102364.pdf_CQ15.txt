The given context does not provide any direct information about the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, or others. However, it mentions several machine learning methods used for prediction and inference, including Random Forest, CART Ensembles, Bagger, TreeNet (stochastic gradient boosting), and MARS regression splines. While these methods do involve some form of optimization, they are not explicitly mentioned as part of a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot determine which optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline.
