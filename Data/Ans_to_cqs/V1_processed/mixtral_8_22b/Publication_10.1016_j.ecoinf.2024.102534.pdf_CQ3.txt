The given context does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which data annotation techniques were employed based solely on this context.

The context primarily focuses on authorship contributions and roles within a research project related to various topics, including resources, supervision, validation, investigation, data curation, and more. Additionally, there are references to several sources regarding orchids, medicinal plants, and geographical studies, but none of these directly address the topic of data annotation techniques in deep learning pipelines.
