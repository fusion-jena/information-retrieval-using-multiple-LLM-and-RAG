Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of audio files in the CLO-43DS dataset, which could potentially come from various sources such as recordings made through microphones or other sound capturing devices, publicly available datasets, or even synthetically generated audio. It also discusses the use of Mel-spectrograms, harmonic-component based spectrograms, and percussive-component based spectrograms as inputs to CNNs, but it doesn't specify how these were obtained from the raw audio data.
