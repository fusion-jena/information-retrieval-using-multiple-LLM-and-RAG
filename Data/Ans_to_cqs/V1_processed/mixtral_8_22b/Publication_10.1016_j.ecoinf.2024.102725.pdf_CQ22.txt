Four evaluation metrics are utilized in this study to compare the differences between the predicted and actual images. These include the coefficient of determination (R^2), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and error relative global accuracy (ERGAS).

The coefficient of determination (R^2) measures how well the predicted images fit the reference images, with values ranging from negative infinity to 1. A higher R^2 value indicates a better fit between the predicted and true values.

Root mean squared error (RMSE) evaluates the difference between the fused results and observed values by calculating the square root of the average of the squared differences between them. This metric is sensitive to outliers, where a higher value suggests a greater deviation, and a lower value indicates a closer match with observed values.

Mean absolute error (MAE) computes the average magnitude of errors without considering their direction. Lower MAE values suggest more accurate predictions.

Error relative global accuracy (ERGAS) quantifies the overall quality of the reconstructed image compared to the original one. ERGAS takes into account both spectral and spatial distortions, providing a comprehensive assessment of the fusion process.
