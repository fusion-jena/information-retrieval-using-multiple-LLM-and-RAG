The provided context does not explicitly mention specific methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does allude to some types of data being used in typical machine learning applications, which could potentially involve deep learning. These include visual images and acoustic recordings. While the sources of these data are not specified, they could come from various means such as cameras, microphones, or publicly available datasets. It's important to note that the choice of data collection method would depend on the specific application and requirements of the deep learning model. For instance, if the goal is to classify animal species based on their sounds, then one might collect acoustic recordings using specialized equipment in relevant habitats. Alternatively, if the aim is to identify plant species from images, then one might gather photographs from fieldwork or utilize existing image databases. Therefore, while the context does not directly address the query, it suggests possible forms of raw data that could be collected for deep learning applications.
