The information regarding the specific data repository link of the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context is not available. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a direct link to any data repositories like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. However, some related research papers have been cited which might contain relevant details about the deep learning pipelines used for animal individual recognition. For instance, Ferreira et al. (2020) developed a program that autonomously collects training data, generates training datasets, and trains convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for small bird individual recognition. Unfortunately, without additional context or access to these publications, we cannot determine if they include links to the respective data repositories containing the deep learning pipelines.
