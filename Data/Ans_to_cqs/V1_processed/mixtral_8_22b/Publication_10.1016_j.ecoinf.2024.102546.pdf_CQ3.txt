The paper mentions two main types of data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for weed detection: bounding box annotation and instance segmentation. Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest within an image, such as plants or weeds. This technique is used in several studies mentioned in the paper, including those by Gaidel et al. (2023), Madsen et al. (2020), Mylonas et al. (2022), Steininger et al. (2023), and Sudars et al. (2020). For example, Sudars et al. (2020) presented a dataset containing 1,118 RGB images for six crops and eight weed species, with 7,853 bounding box annotations. Similarly, Steininger et al. (2023) used bounding box annotation for their CropAndWeed dataset, which contained a total of 43,814 plant images, although only 8,034 images were labeled.

Instance segmentation is another type of data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline for weed detection. Unlike bounding box annotation, which simply outlines the object of interest, instance segmentation provides more detailed information about each individual object within an image. It allows for precise identification and separation of overlapping objects, making it useful for complex scenes where multiple objects may overlap. However, the paper does not provide specific examples of studies using instance segmentation for weed detection.
