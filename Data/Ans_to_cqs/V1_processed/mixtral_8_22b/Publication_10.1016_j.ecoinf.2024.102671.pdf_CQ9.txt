The data repositories mentioned in the given context are Resource Environment Science and Data Research Center Data Center (<https://www.resdc.cn/>), OpenStreetMap (<https://www.openstreetmap.org>), Geospatial Data Cloud (<http://www.gscloud.cn/>), National Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Scientific (<http://data.tpdc.ac.cn>), Chinese Research Data Services Platform (<http://www.cnrds.com>). However, it is unclear if these resources contain the specific data related to the deep learning pipeline or if they are used as sources for other types of data in this study. Therefore, without additional information, it cannot be determined where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
