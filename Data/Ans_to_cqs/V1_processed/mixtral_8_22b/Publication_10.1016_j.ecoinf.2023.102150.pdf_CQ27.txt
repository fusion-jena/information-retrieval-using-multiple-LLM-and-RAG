The text does not provide information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed answer regarding the specific steps followed for model deployment such as model serialization or platform selection.

However, generally speaking, once a deep learning model has been trained and validated, it needs to be deployed into a production environment where it can receive real-time input and generate predictions. This usually involves saving the model weights and architecture in a format that can be loaded later, known as model serialization. Then, the serialized model can be integrated into a suitable platform or application depending on the use case, which could range from web applications, mobile apps, IoT devices, etc.

Since the text does not mention any specifics about the deployment process, we can assume that standard practices were likely followed based on the requirements and constraints of the project.
