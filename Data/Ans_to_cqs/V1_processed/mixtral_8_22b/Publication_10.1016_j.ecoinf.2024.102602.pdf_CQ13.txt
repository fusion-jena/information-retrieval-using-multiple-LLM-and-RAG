The deep learning models used for the classification task employed the Adam optimizer algorithm for optimization. The learning rates were determined through empirical trials over 100 epochs. However, the exact learning rates used are not explicitly mentioned in the given context. The models were evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation, with a batch size of 10 and 100 epochs. It is important to note that the best results were obtained by EfficientNetB0 with a learning rate of 10^-4, achieving high accuracy, sensitivity, and f1-score. Similarly, Inception-v3 with the same learning rate also demonstrated high performance.
