The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the type of optimizer employed. However, it is mentioned that data augmentation was tested with multiple configurations and proved efficient for improving results quickly. Additionally, Adam optimization method is referenced in one of the cited papers [27], but there is no direct confirmation if this method was utilized in the current work. Therefore, without further details from the original source, we cannot definitively determine which hyperparameters were used in their deep learning model.
