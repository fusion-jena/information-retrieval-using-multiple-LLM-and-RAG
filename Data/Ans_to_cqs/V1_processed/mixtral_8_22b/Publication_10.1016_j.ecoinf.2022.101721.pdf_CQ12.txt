The paper titled "Development and Test of a Bat Calls Detection and Classification Method Based on Convolutional Neural Networks" by Paumen et al. (2021) suggests that the authors have developed a pipeline for detecting and classifying bat calls using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This implies that the deep learning model used in their pipeline is a CNN. However, it is important to note that other papers or studies may use different types of deep learning models such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformer models depending on the specific application and requirements.
