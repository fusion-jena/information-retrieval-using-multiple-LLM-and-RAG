The paper does not provide explicit information on the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that a diverse dataset was used for training and testing the model. Additionally, the use of logistic regression analysis suggests that some form of validation or cross-validation may have been employed during the development process. Nevertheless, without more detailed information, it cannot be confirmed whether stratified splitting was also utilized.
