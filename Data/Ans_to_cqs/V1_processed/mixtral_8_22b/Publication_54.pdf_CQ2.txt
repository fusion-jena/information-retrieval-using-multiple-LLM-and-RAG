Based on the given context, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images. This is evident from several statements throughout the text, such as "randomly split the endemic bird data into 3,132 images," "augmented the training dataset 10 times, resulting in a total of 31,320 images," and "760 images...were used for testing." These references clearly indicate that the input data for the deep learning models consists of images. Therefore, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images.
