The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is object detection. More specifically, the model aims to accurately detect objects in underwater optical images, which are typically characterized by poor visibility due to complex imaging environments. The model, called Underwater Object Detection Network (UODN), is based on the YOLOv8 architecture but introduces several modifications to better handle the unique challenges posed by underwater images. One such modification is the replacement of the SPPF module in YOLOv8 with a newly proposed LKSP module, which increases the receptive field of the network and enables it to recognize objects of various sizes more effectively. Another key change is the use of the CSMB module instead of the C2f module for feature extraction, which helps capture more comprehensive and rich feature information from underwater images. Overall, the goal of this deep learning model is to improve the accuracy and robustness of underwater object detection, which has important applications in fields such as marine biology, oceanography, and underwater robotics.
