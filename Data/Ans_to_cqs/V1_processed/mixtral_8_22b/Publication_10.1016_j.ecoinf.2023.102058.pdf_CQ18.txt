The text does not provide explicit information on the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions that a grid search was used to find the best number of trees (ntrees) for the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, which suggests that cross-validation or similar techniques might have been employed to evaluate the model performance during this process. Additionally, the paper discusses other machine learning algorithms like Principal Component Regression (PCR), Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR), and deep learning algorithms, but it does not specify any particular strategies for monitoring their performance during training.
