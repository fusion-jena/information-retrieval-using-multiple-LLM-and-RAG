Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no information about specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, some common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, and adding noise to the input data. These techniques help increase the diversity of the training data and improve the generalization performance of the model. In this case, since the experiments were performed on a small-sized dataset without data augmentation, it may limit the ability of the model to learn more complex features or patterns in the data.
