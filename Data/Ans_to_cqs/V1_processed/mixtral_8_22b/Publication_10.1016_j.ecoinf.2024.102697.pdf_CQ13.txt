The text does not provide specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. However, it mentions that Bayesian Optimization was used to minimize a 5 k-fold cross-validation loss during model development. Additionally, it states that the number of trees, leaves, and clustering methods were considered when applying the random forest method. These could potentially be some of the hyperparameters optimized during the model development process.
