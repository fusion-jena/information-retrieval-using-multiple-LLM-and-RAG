Based on the given information, it is not explicitly stated which specific cloud computing platform or service provider (such as Amazon Web Services [AWS], Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform) was used to host and run the deep learning model. However, we do know that the model was deployed in a cloud-based system with certain hardware and network specifications, including an Intel Core i9 processor equivalent to the 7980XE running at 2.60 GHz, a Tesla T4 GPU, 1Gbps bandwidth, 100GB storage, maximum latency of 50ms, secure wireless connectivity via WPA3, and various cloud features like scalability, resource pooling, security, and cost-effectiveness. Additionally, the training process took place in Google Colab using a Tesla T4 GPU and CUDA Version-12.0. Nevertheless, without explicit mention of the cloud platform used for deployment, one cannot definitively state whether AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or another service provider was utilized.
