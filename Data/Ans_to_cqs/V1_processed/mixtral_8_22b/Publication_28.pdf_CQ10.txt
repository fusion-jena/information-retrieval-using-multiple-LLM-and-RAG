Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to provide the exact code repository link of the deep learning pipeline used for satellite image classification. However, some of the papers mentioned in the context might have shared their source codes or datasets publicly. For example, Li et al. (2020) published a paper titled "Multi-label remote sensing image scene classification by combining a convolutional neural network and a graph neural network" in Remote Sensing journal. They may have made their implementation available online. Similarly, Liu et al. (2020) published another paper titled "Deepsat v2: Feature augmented convolutional neural nets for satellite image classification" in Remote Sensing Letters journal. They also could have shared their codebase with the research community. To find out if these authors have shared any code repositories, one should look up their respective publications and check if they have included links to their implementations. Additionally, searching for relevant keywords such as "Deep Learning Satellite Image Classification Code Repository" on popular platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket might yield useful results.
