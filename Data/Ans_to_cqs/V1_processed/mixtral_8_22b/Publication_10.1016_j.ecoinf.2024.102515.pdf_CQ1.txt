In this study, the 'Full-archive search endpoint' is used to access the entire dataset published on Twitter from its beginning in 2006-2007 until the end of 2022. The API works by searching for words, hashtags, or combinations of both in the text of tweets, similar to the Twitter Advanced Search interface. Three different criteria are employed for the tweet search: (i) tweets where users ask "who knows" or if "anyone knows" what they have found, (ii) tweets that directly ask "what is this" that they have found, and (iii) tweets from users claiming to have found something, with textual expression as "I/we have found." The twarc2 library is used to handle the data in JSON format returned by the Twitter API, simplifying the handling of quota limits imposed by the Twitter API and the pagination resulting from a single query.
