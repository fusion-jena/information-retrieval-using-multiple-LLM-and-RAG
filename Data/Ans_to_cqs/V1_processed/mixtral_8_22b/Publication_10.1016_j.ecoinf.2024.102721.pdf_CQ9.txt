The article does not provide information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions the use of various datasets such as meteorological data, remote sensing data, and soil moisture data but does not specify any specific repositories or platforms used for storing or sharing these datasets. Therefore, it is not possible to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available based solely on the given context.
