The information provided does not include a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions several links related to climate data, land cover data, elevation data, and other relevant datasets. These are:

* Climate data: <https://chelsa-climate.org/downloads/>
* Land cover data: <https://land.copernicus.eu/global/products/lc>
* Elevation data: <https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/copernicus-land-monitoring-service-eu-dem>

These links may be useful resources for building or training a deep learning pipeline, depending on the specific requirements of the project. However, without more context about the nature of the deep learning pipeline being referred to, it is impossible to provide a direct answer to the query.
