The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This can be seen in the code snippet where the `cnn_learner` function is called with the argument `arch = resnet18()`. The ResNet18 architecture is a popular choice for image classification tasks due to its high accuracy and relatively low computational requirements compared to other architectures like ResNet50.
