The given piece of context does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or setting a specific random seed value. However, it mentions the use of the Keras ImageDataGenerator function for image augmentation, which includes several random assignments such as rotation, width and height shifts, shearing, zooming, flipping, and filling modes. These techniques help introduce variability into the dataset, making the model more robust and generalizable. While this doesn't directly address managing randomness through a fixed seed value, it demonstrates how randomness can be incorporated during training to improve model performance.

To manage randomness in the deep learning pipeline, one common strategy is to set a fixed random seed value before running any code involving random operations. This ensures reproducibility across different runs and allows researchers to compare results accurately. Another approach is to employ deterministic algorithms where possible, reducing the need for randomness altogether. In summary, while the given context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness via a fixed seed value, incorporating randomness through image augmentation techniques is a valuable aspect of building robust deep learning models.
