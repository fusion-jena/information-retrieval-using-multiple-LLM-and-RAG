Unfortunately, the provided context does not contain specific details about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the exact steps taken for model serialization or platform selection. However, generally speaking, after training a deep learning model, it can be serialized into a format like ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) or saved as a checkpoint file. This allows the model to be easily loaded and used for predictions. As for platform selection, popular choices include cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure, which offer services for hosting and managing machine learning models. Local servers or edge devices can also be used depending on the application requirements.
