Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it can be inferred that some form of labeling was performed during the dataset preparation phase since the paper mentions using labeled data for training and testing purposes. In this case, the labels correspond to the bird species being identified by the deep learning algorithm. Therefore, while the exact methodology of data annotation is not specified, we can assume that each audio sample was assigned a corresponding bird species label.
