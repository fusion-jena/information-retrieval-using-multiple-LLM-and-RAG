The given context does not provide explicit information about specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it mentions several machine learning algorithms and hyperparameters related to these models. Hyperparameters play a crucial role in optimizing the performance of machine learning models. In this case, the context discusses various hyperparameters associated with different models, including maximum depth, minimum sample split, and learning rate.

While the context does not directly mention optimization techniques like SGD or Adam, it implies that some form of optimization might be involved during the training phase of these models. For instance, adjusting the learning rate can impact how quickly a model learns from its mistakes and converges towards optimal solutions. Similarly, other hyperparameters mentioned, such as colsample\_bytree, min\_child\_weight, sub\_sample, random\_state, min\_samples\_split, min\_samples\_leaf, max\_features, min\_impurity\_decrease, min\_weight\_fraction\_leaf, loss, bootstrap, bootstrap\_features, max\_samples, max\_leaf\_nodes, l2\_regularization, max\_bins, min\_child\_samples, reg\_lambda, reg\_alpha, and num\_leaves, could also influence the optimization process indirectly by affecting the overall performance of the models.

In summary, while the given context does not explicitly state which optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline, it suggests that various hyperparameters are adjusted to improve the performance of machine learning models, which may involve some form of optimization during the training phase.
