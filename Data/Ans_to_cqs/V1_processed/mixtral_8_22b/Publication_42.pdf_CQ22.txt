The performance of the deep learning models in this study is evaluated primarily using the F1-score metric. The F1-score is a measure of a test's accuracy that considers both the precision and recall of the test to compute the score. Precision is the number of true positive results divided by the number of all positive results returned by the classifier, while recall is the number of true positive results divided by the number of positive samples in the dataset. Additionally, other metrics like average precision, recall, and F1-scores are also mentioned to indicate suitable model classification. However, no specific mention of accuracy as a standalone metric is made in the given context.
