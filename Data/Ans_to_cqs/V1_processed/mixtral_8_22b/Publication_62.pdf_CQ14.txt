The paper does not provide information on how the hyperparameters of the models were optimized. Therefore, I do not have enough information to determine whether they used methods such as grid search or random search.

Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. It could be possible that the authors did not use any specific optimization techniques like grid search or random search, but without further information, we cannot confirm this.
