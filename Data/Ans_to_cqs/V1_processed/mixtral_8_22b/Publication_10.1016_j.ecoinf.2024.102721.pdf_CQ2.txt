Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention what specific data format was used in their deep learning pipeline. However, considering they were forecasting ecological water demand using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), we can infer that the data format used would most likely be numerical or tabular data such as CSV files. This is because LSTMs are typically used for processing sequential data like time series data, which often comes in numerical form. Additionally, since this study focuses on predicting ecological water demand, relevant variables could include historical water usage data, climate data, and other related factors, which are usually presented in numerical or tabular format. Therefore, while there isn't explicit confirmation, it is reasonable to assume that the researchers utilized numerical or tabular data formats in their deep learning pipeline.
