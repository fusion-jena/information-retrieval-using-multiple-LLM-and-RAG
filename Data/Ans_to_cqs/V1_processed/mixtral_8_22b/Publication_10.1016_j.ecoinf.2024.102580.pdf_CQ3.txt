The text does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in their deep learning pipeline. However, it does state that they use "annotated images" for training their models, which suggests that some form of manual or automated annotation process was employed. Given that the authors discuss semantic segmentation for vegetation mapping, it can be inferred that pixel-level annotation might have been utilized. Additionally, the paper mentions limitations related to the 'other' class, indicating that multiple classes were involved in the annotation process. Unfortunately, without explicit information on the exact annotation technique used, one cannot definitively state whether bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, or other methods were implemented.
