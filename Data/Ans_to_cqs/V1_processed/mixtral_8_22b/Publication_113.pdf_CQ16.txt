The paper does not explicitly state the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions that after the first 30,000 active queries, the classifier achieves 93.2% overall accuracy. This suggests that the authors might have used a certain threshold of accuracy or performance metric to decide when to stop training. Additionally, the use of active learning strategies implies that the model continues to improve its performance as more labeled data becomes available. Therefore, it could be inferred that the training process may continue until a satisfactory level of performance is achieved or until there are no significant improvements in the model's performance.
