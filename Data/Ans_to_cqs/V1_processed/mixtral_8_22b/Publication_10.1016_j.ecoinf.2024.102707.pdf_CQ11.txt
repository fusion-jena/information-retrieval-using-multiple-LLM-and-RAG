The text does not provide a direct link to the data repository where the deep learning pipeline was stored or shared. However, it mentions that the authors made their data and code available along with the trained machine learning model. Therefore, one would need to refer to the original publication by A. Cusick et al. in Ecological Informatics (volume 82, year 2024) titled 'Deep Learning Approach for Detecting Seabird Colonies Using High Spatial Resolution Satellite Imagery'. This paper should contain information on how to access the relevant resources.
