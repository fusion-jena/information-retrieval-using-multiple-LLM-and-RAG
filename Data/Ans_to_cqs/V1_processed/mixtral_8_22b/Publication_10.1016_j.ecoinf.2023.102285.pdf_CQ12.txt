Based on the given references and information, there isn't enough detail to determine the exact type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, some clues suggest that a convolutional neural network (CNN) might have been employed. For instance, the paper mentions the use of deep learning methods for analyzing high-resolution images, which often involves CNN architectures due to their effectiveness in handling spatial data. Additionally, the reference to LCSE-ResNet, a variant of Residual Networks (ResNets), further supports the possibility of using a CNN-based approach. Nevertheless, without explicit confirmation, one cannot definitively state the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
