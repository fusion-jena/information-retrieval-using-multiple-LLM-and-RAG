The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific criteria for determining when training is complete. However, based on general machine learning practices, common criteria include observing a plateau in the validation loss, reaching a predefined number of epochs, or achieving a desired level of performance on a validation set. It should be noted that these criteria are not mentioned in the given context.

Based on the information available, it appears that the focus of this study is on validating the accuracy of an automated method for measuring mycelium length against a manual gold standard method. The authors use Lin's Concordance Coefficient (ρc) to measure the strength of agreement between the two methods. They consider the one-sided 95% confidence limit of ρc and classify the agreement as poor, moderate, substantial, or almost perfect based on the value of CIlow95%(ρc).

Regarding the segmentation of filamentous structures, the authors discuss various approaches such as global thresholding, local adaptive thresholding, and ridge detection methods. However, they do not provide details about how these techniques were applied or what criteria were used to evaluate their effectiveness.

Therefore, without additional context, it is not possible to definitively answer the query regarding the criteria used to determine when training is complete.
