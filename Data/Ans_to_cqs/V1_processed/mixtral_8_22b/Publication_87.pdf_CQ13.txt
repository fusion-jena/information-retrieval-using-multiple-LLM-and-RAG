The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that the fit\_one\_cycle function was used, which suggests that cyclical learning rates were employed during training. This method involves varying the learning rate over each cycle, starting with a minimum value, increasing it linearly until reaching a maximum value, then decreasing it back down to the minimum before beginning the next cycle. Additionally, the number of epochs used for training is specified as 2 for illustration purposes, but 20 epochs were actually used to obtain the final results.
