The given context does not provide information on specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions several sources related to infectious disease prediction, including research papers, online resources, and databases like TerraClimate, Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station Data, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and WorldPop. These datasets might be relevant for building models related to infectious diseases but do not directly correspond to common deep learning benchmark datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
