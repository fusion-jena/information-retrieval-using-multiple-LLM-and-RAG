The text does not explicitly mention which specific deep learning framework is used to build the model. However, it mentions that the ResNet50 is initialized with ImageNet weights from Keras. This suggests that the authors might have used Keras, a high-level neural networks API written in Python, running on top of TensorFlow or Theano, to develop their deep learning models.
