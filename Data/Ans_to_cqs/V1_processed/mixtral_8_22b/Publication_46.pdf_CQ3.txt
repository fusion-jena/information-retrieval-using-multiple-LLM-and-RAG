Unfortunately, there isn't any information about specific data annotation techniques used in the given context. However, I can provide some general insights regarding common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines.

Data annotation is the process of labeling raw data so that machine learning algorithms can use it to train models. In computer vision tasks, commonly used data annotation techniques include:

1. Bounding Box Annotation: This technique involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects within images to identify their location. It is widely used for object detection tasks where the goal is to locate and classify objects within an image.

2. Instance Segmentation: Unlike bounding box annotation, instance segmentation provides pixel-level accuracy by outlining the exact shape of individual objects within an image. This technique is useful when precise object boundaries are required, such as in medical imaging applications.

3. Semantic Segmentation: Similar to instance segmentation, semantic segmentation also labels every pixel in an image but groups them based on their category rather than individual instances. For example, all pixels belonging to cars would be labeled as 'car', regardless of whether they belong to separate car instances.

4. Landmark Annotation: Also known as key point annotation, this method involves marking specific points on objects within images. These landmarks help define the structure of objects and are often used in facial recognition systems.

5. Polygon Annotation: This technique involves creating polygonal shapes around objects within images. It is particularly useful for irregularly shaped objects or those with complex structures.
