The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks, particularly in the field of natural history collections (NHCs). In this case, the raw data would likely be images of specimens from various NHCs. These images could potentially come from a variety of sources such as digital cameras or scanners used during the digitization process of physical specimens. Additionally, the authors mention that remarkable progress has been made in compiling specimen data and images, which suggests that existing databases or public datasets might have been used as part of the data collection process. Nevertheless, without further information, we cannot definitively state what specific methods were employed for collecting raw data in this particular study.
