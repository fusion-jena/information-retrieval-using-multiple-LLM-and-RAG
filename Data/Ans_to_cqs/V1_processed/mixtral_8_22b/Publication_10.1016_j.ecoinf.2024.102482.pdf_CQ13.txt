Based on the given context, the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are not explicitly stated. However, some details about the architecture of the model are provided. For instance, the model consists of three Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers with output vector sizes of 32, 32, and 16, respectively. Additionally, a dropout rate of 50% was applied during training. These are examples of hyperparameters that influence the structure and behavior of the model. Unfortunately, the context does not provide information regarding other hyperparameters such as the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, or epoch count. Therefore, these values remain unknown based on the available information.
