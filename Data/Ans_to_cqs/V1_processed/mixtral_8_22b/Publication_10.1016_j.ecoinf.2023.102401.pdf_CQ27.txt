The text does not provide explicit information about the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it mentions preparing hardware servers capable of training deep learning models to deploy the YWnet network. This suggests that the deployment process likely involves setting up suitable hardware infrastructure to support the execution of the trained model. Additionally, the mention of tuning hyperparameters implies that optimization strategies were employed to ensure optimal performance of the deployed model. Unfortunately, without further context or additional information, it cannot be determined if other common practices like model serialization or platform selection were part of the deployment process.
