The primary method used for collecting raw data in this context is through field surveys. Specifically, field data was collected during the vegetation season in July 2019 on 109 sample plots. The field survey data, including tree positions and positions of the center of the plots, were collected using Field-Map technology ([www.fieldmap.cz](http://www.fieldmap.cz)) on statistical forest inventory plots placed within the study area in pairs with a distance of 50 meters between paired plot centers. Additionally, remote sensing technologies such as LiDAR and Landsat 8 data have been employed to retrieve forest aboveground biomass. These techniques involve the use of sensors mounted on aircraft or satellites to collect data over large areas. Public datasets may also be utilized, although no specific mention of their use is made in the provided context.
