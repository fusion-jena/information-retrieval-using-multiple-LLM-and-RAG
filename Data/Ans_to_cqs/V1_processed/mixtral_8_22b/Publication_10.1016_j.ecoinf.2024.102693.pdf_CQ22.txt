The classification performance of the deep learning models is evaluated using several metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into different aspects of the model's performance. Accuracy measures the overall correctness of the model predictions. Precision indicates the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions made by the model. Recall shows the ratio of correctly predicted positive instances out of all actual positive instances. Lastly, the F1-score combines Precision and Recall into a single metric, providing a balanced measure of the model's performance.
