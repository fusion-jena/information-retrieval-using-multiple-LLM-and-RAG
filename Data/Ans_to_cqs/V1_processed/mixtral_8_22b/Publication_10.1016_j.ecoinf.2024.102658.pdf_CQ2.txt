Based on the given information, it appears that the study uses two main types of data: distribution data for machine learning models and physiological data for process-based models. However, there is no explicit mention of specific data formats such as images, audio, video, or CSV files. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the exact data format used in their deep learning pipeline.
