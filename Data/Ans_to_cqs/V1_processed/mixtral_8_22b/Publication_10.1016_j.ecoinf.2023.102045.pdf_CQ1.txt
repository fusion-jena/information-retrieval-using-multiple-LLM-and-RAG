The provided context does not directly discuss the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that maps are generalizations and imperfect representations of the features they show due to data gathering and representation processes. These processes could involve various methods for collecting raw data, including but not limited to surveys, sensors, and public datasets. Surveys can gather human input on specific topics, while sensors collect environmental data like temperature, humidity, or air quality. Public datasets provide open access to large amounts of pre-existing data, often collected by government agencies or research institutions. In the field of computational ecology, these methods could be employed to gather data on factors affecting ecosystems, such as climate change or invasive species.
