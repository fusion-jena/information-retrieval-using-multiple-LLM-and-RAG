The papers cited do not directly discuss specific techniques to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, they provide insights into the importance of considering data bias and its impact on the performance of machine learning models.

In general, there are several techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets or strata based on the target variable, ensuring that each subset has approximately the same proportion of samples from each class. This technique helps maintain the balance between classes when partitioning the dataset into training and testing sets.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to handle imbalanced datasets. Oversampling involves duplicating examples from the minority class, while undersampling involves removing examples from the majority class. Both methods aim to achieve a balanced dataset, but oversampling can lead to overfitting, while undersampling can result in loss of information.

Diverse data collection involves collecting data from various sources to ensure that the dataset represents different populations, reducing the risk of bias. This technique is particularly useful when dealing with underrepresented groups or rare events.

It is essential to note that addressing data bias requires careful consideration of the problem domain and the available resources. The choice of technique depends on factors such as the nature of the data, the type of bias present, and the computational requirements. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate the effectiveness of each method before applying them to real-world problems.
