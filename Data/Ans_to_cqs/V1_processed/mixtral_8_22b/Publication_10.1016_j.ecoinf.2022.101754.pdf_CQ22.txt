The study uses several metrics to evaluate the performance of the machine learning models, including AdaBoost, Bayes, Random Forest (RF), and Neural Network (NET). These metrics include:

* Average Angle Deviation (AD): This measures the deviation from the line 1:1 for both test and all samples. It is expressed in degrees.
* Accuracy with Tolerance (ACT1 and ACT2): Two levels of accuracy are considered - one with a tolerance of 15 t/ha ± 10% of Above Ground Biomass (AGB) and another with a tolerance of 10 t/ha ± 5% of AGB.
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): This metric measures the standard deviation of the prediction errors or residuals. It is expressed in units of AGB [t/ha].
* Coefficient of Determination (R2): This represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be predicted from the independent variables. It ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates perfect correlation.
* Cross-Validation R2 (CV\_R2): This is a measure of how well the model performs when predicting new data.

These metrics are used to compare the performance of different machine learning algorithms and determine which method provides the best results. Based on these evaluations, it was found that the AdaBoost algorithm had the highest mean score of 45, followed by RF with a mean score of 42, NET with a mean score of 34, and Bayes with a mean score of 31. All pairwise comparisons between these methods showed statistically significant differences, with a p-value of 0.001 for each combination.
