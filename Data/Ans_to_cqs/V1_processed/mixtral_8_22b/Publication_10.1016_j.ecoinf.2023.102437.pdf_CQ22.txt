Based on the given context, the paper titled "Enhancing land cover/land use (LCLU) classification through a comparative analysis of hyperparameters optimization approaches for deep neural network (DNN)" uses the metric RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. Additionally, the coefficient of determination (R^2) is mentioned as another metric used to assess the correlation between predicted and actual values. However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of accuracy, precision, or recall as evaluation metrics. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, it appears that RMSE and R^2 are the primary metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model.
