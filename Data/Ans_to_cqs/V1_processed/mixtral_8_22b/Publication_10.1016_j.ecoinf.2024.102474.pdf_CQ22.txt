The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including Mean Absolute Difference (MAD), Optimal Linear Scaling (OLS), Earth Movers Distance (EMD), and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM). These metrics are calculated based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the RGBI bands.

MAD, OLS, and EMD are initially defined as loss metrics, but for this study, they have been transformed into scores according to the standard EarthNet2021 evaluation methodology. A perfect fit between predictions and observations results in a score of 1, while a poor fit yields a score of 0. On the other hand, SSIM is a similarity metric where higher values indicate better model performance.

The NDVI is derived from reflectance in the red and near-infrared bands (IR) and is computed using the formula provided in the given context. This index plays a crucial role in evaluating the performance of the deep learning model.
