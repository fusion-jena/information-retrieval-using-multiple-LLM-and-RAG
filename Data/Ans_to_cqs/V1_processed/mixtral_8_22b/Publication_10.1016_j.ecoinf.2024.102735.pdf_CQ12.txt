The paper titled "Prediction of chlorophyll-a as an indicator of harmful algal blooms using deep learning with Bayesian approximation for uncertainty assessment" by Busari et al. (2024) uses a deep learning model for predicting chlorophyll-a concentrations. However, the specific type of deep learning model used in their pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. Therefore, it cannot be determined if they use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers based solely on this information.
