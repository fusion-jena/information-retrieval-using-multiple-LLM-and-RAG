The given context does not provide explicit details about specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of the fast.ai platform for training and validating models, which could potentially utilize various optimization algorithms depending on the configuration. Additionally, the text discusses the application of transfer learning, where a pre-trained ResNet-34 model is leveraged for specialized tasks with limited data. While the optimization technique used during the initial training of the ResNet-34 model isn't specified, it can be assumed that some form of gradient descent optimization was employed due to its prevalent usage in deep learning models.
