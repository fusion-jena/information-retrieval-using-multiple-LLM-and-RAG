Based on the provided context, it does not explicitly mention any specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. However, it discusses two strategies to address the issue of limited training data in deep learning applications for natural systems like tree detection: semi-supervised learning and self-supervised learning.

In semi-supervised learning, a combination of labeled and unlabeled data is used within a semi-supervised framework. This allows neural networks to learn generalized features from a larger set of training examples before being fine-tuned on a smaller number of high-quality annotations. Although this strategy could potentially help improve deep learning performance on limited training data, it remains uncertain if lower-quality annotations can be utilized effectively for initial model training due to the limitations of current unsupervised tree delimitation approaches.

Self-supervised learning, on the other hand, employs unsupervised methods to create training data that can then be used to train supervised models. This technique has been successfully implemented in remote sensing for hyperspectral image classification. Since self-supervision solely depends on unlabeled data, it might offer a promising solution to overcome the data limitation challenges faced in deep learning applications.

While these strategies do not directly correspond to traditional data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotation, or scaling, they still contribute to enhancing the amount and diversity of available training data, thereby improving the overall performance of deep learning models.
