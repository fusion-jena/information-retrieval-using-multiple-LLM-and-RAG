Based on the given context, it is not explicitly mentioned what specific optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline for this particular study. However, common optimization techniques used in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSprop), and others. These techniques are used to minimize the loss function during training by adjusting the weights and biases of the neural network. Without further information, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the optimization techniques used in this study.
