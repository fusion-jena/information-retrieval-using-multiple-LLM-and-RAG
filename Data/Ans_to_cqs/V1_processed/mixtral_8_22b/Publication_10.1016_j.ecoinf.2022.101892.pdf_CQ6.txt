The text does not provide explicit information about specific preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it mentions two important preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning models. Firstly, the resolution of all images was downscaled to 224 Ã— 224 pixels before being fed into the models. This step helps to standardize input dimensions and can also help improve computational efficiency. Secondly, the text mentions applying aggressive data augmentation to avoid overfitting and imbalance problems. Data augmentation techniques can include various transformations like rotation, zooming, cropping, and flipping, among others. These techniques help create more diverse training samples and improve the robustness of the trained models.
