The text does not provide explicit details about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the model was well-trained on a particular object class, suggesting that diverse datasets might have been used for training. Additionally, the authors anticipate that the minimum detection size limits they identified are more generalizable to different study systems, given that the model is well-trained. This implies that some form of validation or testing may have been conducted using various datasets to assess the model's performance across different scenarios. Nevertheless, without further information, it cannot be confirmed whether techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting were employed specifically to enhance the model's generalizability.
