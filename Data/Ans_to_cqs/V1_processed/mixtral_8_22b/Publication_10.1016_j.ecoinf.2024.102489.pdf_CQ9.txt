The given context does not provide any direct information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it mentions three different data sources for high spatial resolution satellite images: USGS Earth Explorer, CRESDA, and Copernicus EU. It can be assumed that these platforms might contain relevant datasets required for the deep learning pipeline. Nevertheless, without explicit mention or confirmation, we cannot definitively state that these are the repositories for the deep learning pipeline data. Therefore, further clarification would be needed to accurately determine the correct data repository.
