Based on the given context, it appears that the study uses a specified number of iterations to determine when training is complete. However, there is no explicit mention of using validation loss plateau or any other specific criteria to decide when training should be stopped. Instead, the focus seems to be on utilizing the Eureka Pro software for Genetic Programming (GP) modeling, which was developed by Cornell University's Data Science Order and released in 2009. The software is chosen due to its ability to simultaneously select appropriate features and perform modeling tasks. Furthermore, the study employs a standard data split, where 70% of the available data is used for model training, and the remaining 30% is dedicated to testing and evaluating the results.
