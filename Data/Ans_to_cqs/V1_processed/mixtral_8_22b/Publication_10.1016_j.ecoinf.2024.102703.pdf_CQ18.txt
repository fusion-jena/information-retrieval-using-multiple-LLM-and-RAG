To monitor the model performance during training, two strategies have been employed. Firstly, the maximum number of training iterations has been set to 10,000. This means that the model will stop training once it reaches this limit, regardless of its performance. Secondly, a training error threshold of 0.001 has been established. If the model achieves this level of accuracy before reaching the maximum number of iterations, the training process will terminate early. These strategies ensure that the model does not overfit or underfit the data, while also preventing unnecessary computational resources from being wasted.
