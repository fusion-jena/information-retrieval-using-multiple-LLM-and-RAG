The given context does not provide specific information about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge, some common techniques used to handle data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets or strata, ensuring each subset maintains the same distribution of classes as the original dataset. Oversampling increases the number of instances in minority classes by duplicating existing examples or creating synthetic ones. Undersampling reduces the number of instances in majority classes by randomly removing examples. Lastly, diverse data collection aims to gather more representative datasets containing various features and attributes to minimize biases.

These methods help improve the balance between different classes within the dataset, which can lead to better performance when training deep learning models. It should be noted that these techniques may not always be necessary depending on the nature of the dataset and the specific requirements of the project.
