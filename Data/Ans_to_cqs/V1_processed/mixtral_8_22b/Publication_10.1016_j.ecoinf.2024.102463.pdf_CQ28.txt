Unfortunately, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine which specific cloud platform or service was used to deploy the deep learning model. The text only mentions that the methods were written in Python and implemented in the PyCharm environment, and that the Keras library with TensorFlow backend was used for developing the machine learning methods. However, there is no mention of any cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform being used for deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to your query.
