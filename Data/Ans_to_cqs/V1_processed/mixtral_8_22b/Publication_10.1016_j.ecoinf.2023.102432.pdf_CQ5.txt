The text does not explicitly mention any specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it discusses remote sensing applications using various types of imagery for detecting invasive plant species. The mentioned datasets include NAIP (National Agriculture Imaging Program), RapidEye, and Landsat 8 imagery. These datasets were used to train a multiple-instance learning algorithm called MTMI-SMF, which allowed for variability or imprecision in the training dataset. The goal was to accurately detect Brazilian peppertree, a highly problematic invasive plant species, within the Everglades National Park.
