The given context does not provide specific details about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some commonly used techniques to handle data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets while maintaining the original distribution of classes within each subset. This ensures that the training and testing datasets have similar distributions, reducing potential biases caused by imbalanced classes.

Oversampling and undersampling are methods used to balance the number of samples between different classes. Oversampling increases the number of minority class instances, while undersampling reduces the majority class instances. These techniques can help mitigate the impact of class imbalance on model performance.

Diverse data collection focuses on gathering a wide range of examples from various sources to create a comprehensive dataset. By including diverse data, the model can learn patterns from multiple perspectives, improving its ability to generalize and reducing potential biases due to limited representation.

While these techniques are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, they are widely recognized approaches to handling data bias during preprocessing in deep learning pipelines.
