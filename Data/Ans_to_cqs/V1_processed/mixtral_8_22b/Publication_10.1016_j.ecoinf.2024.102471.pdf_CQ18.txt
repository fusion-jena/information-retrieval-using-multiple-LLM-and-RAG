Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, we can infer that the authors might have used common strategies such as tracking the validation accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score throughout the training process. Additionally, they could have monitored the loss function values to ensure proper optimization. In this case, the authors mentioned using CTC loss for the Automatic Speech Recognition task during fine-tuning. Therefore, monitoring the CTC loss would likely be part of their strategy to evaluate the model performance during training.
