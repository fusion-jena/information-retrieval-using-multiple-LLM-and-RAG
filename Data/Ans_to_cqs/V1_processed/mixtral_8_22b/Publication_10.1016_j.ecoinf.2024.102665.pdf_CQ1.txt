The papers mentioned do not explicitly discuss the specific methods used for collecting raw data in their respective deep learning pipelines. However, some general methods can be inferred based on the nature of the research. For instance, Do & Tran (2023) focus on detecting the dispersal of the early stages of spotted butterfish in northern Vietnam under global warming. This suggests that they might have collected raw data through field observations or surveys, possibly involving underwater cameras or other sensory equipment. Similarly, Dubinsky & Stambler (1996) examine marine pollution and its effects on coral reefs, which could involve gathering data from various sources such as water quality sensors, satellite imagery, or even publicly available datasets related to ocean health and pollution levels. Additionally, Edmunds et al. (2016) investigate the differential distribution of octocorals and scleractinians around St. John and St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands. Their work likely involves collecting data via diving expeditions, underwater photography, or video recordings. Lastly, Villon et al. (2021) develop automatic underwater fish species classification using limited data and few-shot learning. They may have gathered raw data by capturing underwater footage of different fish species or utilizing existing databases containing images of various aquatic life forms. Overall, while the exact methods for collecting raw data in these studies remain unspecified, it is reasonable to assume that they employed techniques like field surveys, sensor deployments, and the use of public datasets relevant to their respective areas of investigation.
