In the given context, it appears that the hyperparameter being referred to is the weighting factor lambda (位), which is a regularization parameter. To optimize this hyperparameter, the iterative optimization of the objective function was repeated for 100 discrete candidate values of 位 chosen from a vector of equidistant values. This process was carried out according to Hastie et al. (2016). Afterward, the value of 位 that minimizes the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) was selected as the optimal hyperparameter. Therefore, it seems that a form of grid search was employed to optimize the hyperparameter in this case. However, the specific methodology used to select the initial vector of equidistant values for 位 is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
