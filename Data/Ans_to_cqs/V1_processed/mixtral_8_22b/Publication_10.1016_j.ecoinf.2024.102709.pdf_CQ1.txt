Two major ground-based systems, stationary Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) and Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS), including Personal Laser Scanning (PLS), are employed for data collection in the deep learning pipeline. These systems have been applied in studies such as those by Bienert et al. (2021), Gollob et al. (2020a, 2020b), and Tockner et al. (2022). Additionally, the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset of handwritten digits is also used as a source of data for training classification models (Deng, 2012).
