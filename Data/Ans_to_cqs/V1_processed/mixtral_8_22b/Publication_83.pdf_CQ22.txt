The paper uses balanced accuracy and weighted F1-score as evaluation metrics for their deep learning models. Balanced accuracy is calculated by taking the average of true positive rate and true negative rate, which helps to account for imbalance in data classes. Weighted F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, where weights are assigned according to the number of instances in each class. This metric takes into consideration both false positives and false negatives, providing a comprehensive measure of classification performance. Additionally, the confusion matrix is presented to visualize the performance of the best fused model.
