The given context does not explicitly mention any specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models. However, based on common practices in the field, popular frameworks for building deep learning models include TensorFlow and PyTorch. Other possible options could be Keras or MXNet. Without further information, it cannot be definitively stated which framework was used to build the deep learning models mentioned in the context.

Based on the given context, it appears that the focus is primarily on machine learning models rather than specifically deep learning models. The context mentions several machine learning models including Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Naive Bayes (NB), Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). While ANNs are technically considered a subset of deep learning models, they are often grouped together with traditional machine learning models due to their similarities in structure and application. Therefore, while it is likely that some form of deep learning framework may have been used to implement these models, this cannot be confirmed without additional information.
