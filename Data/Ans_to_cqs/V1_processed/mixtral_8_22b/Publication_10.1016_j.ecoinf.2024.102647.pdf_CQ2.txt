Based on the given context, it is not explicitly stated what specific data format is being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer that the data might be in numerical form since there are several values listed such as 1.231, 0.460, 0.000, etc. These could potentially represent various features or parameters related to the study. Additionally, references are made to certain variables like Normalized Difference Salinity Index (NDSI), Land Use (LU), Flow Accumulation, among others, which further suggests that the data might be in a structured format like CSV or similar. It is also worth noting that the study involves soil salinity distribution mapping using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which typically operates on image data. Therefore, while not directly mentioned, it is possible that the input data could include images or other forms of spatial data. Nonetheless, without more explicit information about the exact data format used in the deep learning pipeline, this remains a speculative interpretation based on the available context.
