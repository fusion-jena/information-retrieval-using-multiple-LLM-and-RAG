Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide a specific dataset used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context. However, some commonly used datasets in deep learning include MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet. These datasets are often used for image classification tasks.

MNIST is a dataset of handwritten digits consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. Each image is grayscale and has a resolution of 28x28 pixels.

CIFAR is a dataset containing 60,000 color images divided into 10 classes, including airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, all with a resolution of 32x32 pixels.

ImageNet is a large-scale dataset containing millions of labeled images organized into thousands of categories. It is widely used for object recognition and detection tasks.

Without more information about the specific application or task being performed in the given context, it is impossible to identify the exact dataset used.
