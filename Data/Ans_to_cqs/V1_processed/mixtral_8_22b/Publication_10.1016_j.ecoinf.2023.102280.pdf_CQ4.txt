The text does not explicitly mention specific data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling. However, it does suggest that data augmentation techniques are considered for bioacoustic applications, particularly superimposing noise samples. Superimposing noise samples involves adding background noise to the original signal to create new training examples. This technique helps improve the model's robustness against various types of noises present in real-world scenarios. Other common data augmentation techniques for audio signals include shifting time, changing pitch, altering speed, and adjusting volume. These techniques help increase the diversity of the dataset without collecting additional data, making them valuable for applications where obtaining large-scale datasets is challenging or infeasible.
