The text does not provide explicit information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions that users should consider the iterative nature of model training required to achieve performance suitable for their specific needs. This suggests that monitoring the model performance during training might involve assessing its accuracy and adjusting the training process accordingly until satisfactory results are obtained. Additionally, the text emphasizes the importance of considering the quality of the supplied mask annotations for training dataset images, which implies that monitoring the model performance might include checking the precision of the segmentation masks created during the training process.
