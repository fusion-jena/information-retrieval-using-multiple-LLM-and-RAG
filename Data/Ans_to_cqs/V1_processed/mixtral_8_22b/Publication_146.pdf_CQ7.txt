Based on the provided context, there isn't explicit information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation datasets. However, it can be inferred that the authors have followed common practices in machine learning and deep learning when splitting the data. Typically, the dataset is divided into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set is employed during the training process to fine-tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Lastly, the testing set is utilized after the model has been fully trained to evaluate its performance on unseen data.

In this case, the authors mention that the model was trained for 350 epochs and evaluated using various metrics like precision, recall, F1, GIoU, and mAP. These evaluations were performed based on model validation data, which consisted of 321 image tiles. This suggests that the authors did use a separate validation dataset to assess the model's performance during training. Although the exact methodology for splitting the data is not mentioned, it is likely that the authors adhered to standard practices in machine learning and deep learning by dividing their dataset into training, validation, and possibly testing subsets.
