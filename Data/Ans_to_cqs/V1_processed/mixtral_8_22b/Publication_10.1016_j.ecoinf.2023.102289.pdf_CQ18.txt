Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of a specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, some general strategies used in machine learning include tracking metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., using validation sets, cross-validation techniques, early stopping criteria, and learning curves. These methods help evaluate how well the model is performing and whether it is overfitting or underfitting the data. Since LaDeco utilizes deep learning algorithms like DeepLabv3+ResNet269, these common monitoring strategies could potentially apply here too. But without further details about the implementation, we cannot confirm which exact method was employed.
