The table presented in the given context provides information about the performance evaluation of different prediction models, including a deep learning model based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The metrics used to evaluate these models include Adjusted R^2 (Adjusted Coefficient of Determination), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). These metrics help assess the goodness of fit, prediction errors, and complexity of the models. However, it is important to note that the specific metrics used for evaluating deep learning models may vary depending on the task and application. For example, in classification tasks, common metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, while in regression tasks, mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and R^2 are commonly used.
