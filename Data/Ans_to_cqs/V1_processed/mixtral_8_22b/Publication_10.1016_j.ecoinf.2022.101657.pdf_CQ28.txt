The provided context does not explicitly mention which specific cloud platform (such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform) was used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it discusses two different approaches to implementing neural networks in hardware for low power consumption: one using a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and another using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). These implementations are aimed at reducing power consumption and improving performance rather than specifying a particular cloud platform for deployment. Therefore, based on the information available, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the specific cloud platform used to deploy the deep learning model.
