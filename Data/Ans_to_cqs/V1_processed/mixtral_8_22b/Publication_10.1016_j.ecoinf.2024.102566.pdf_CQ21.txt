The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, based on general practices in machine learning, some common postprocessing steps include evaluating the performance of the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or area under the curve (AUC); creating confusion matrices to visualize the performance of the classifier; generating saliency maps to understand which features contributed most to the predictions made by the model; and fine-tuning hyperparameters to improve the model's performance. It is also important to validate the results obtained from the model using independent datasets to ensure its robustness and reliability.
