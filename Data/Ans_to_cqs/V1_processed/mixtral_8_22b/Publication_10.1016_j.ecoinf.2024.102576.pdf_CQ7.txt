The text does not explicitly state the exact criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it mentions that out of the 16,660 grid cells created, half (8330 cells) were randomly extracted as a mask for training data, while 20% (3,332 cells) were randomly extracted as a mask for validation data. This suggests that the splitting of the data was done randomly, with no specific criteria mentioned apart from the proportions allocated for training and validation purposes.
