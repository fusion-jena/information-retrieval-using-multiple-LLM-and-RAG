The paper uses Mean Scaled Absolute Error (MSAE), Intersection over Union (IoU) averaged over all plant species, and DCA-Procrustes-Correlation (DPC) as evaluation metrics for their deep learning model. These metrics help assess the model's ability to accurately estimate plant cover and species distribution.
