The text does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it discusses the use of fivefold cross-validation for model evaluation and hyperparameter selection. In this method, the dataset is divided into five equal-sized folds, and the training and assessment process is repeated five times, each time using a different fold as the test set. This approach allows for a more comprehensive model performance analysis and can help identify when training should be stopped. Common criteria for stopping training include reaching a predefined number of epochs, achieving a desired level of accuracy or loss on the validation set, or observing no further improvement in validation metrics after several epochs. Without additional information, it cannot be determined which specific criterion was used in this case.
