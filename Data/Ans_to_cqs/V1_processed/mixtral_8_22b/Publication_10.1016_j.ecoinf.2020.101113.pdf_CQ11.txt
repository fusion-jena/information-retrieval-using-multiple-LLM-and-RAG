Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to provide the exact data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. However, I can tell you that the authors mention their use of a custom training loss function and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model with equal-sized input images. They also discuss the importance of addressing challenges such as handling variable sizes of target calls, optimizing data augmentation methods, and maintaining high accuracy while improving prediction efficiency.
