Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning models. However, it can be assumed that some common preprocessing techniques might have been applied, such as normalizing the input images or rescaling them to fit the required input dimensions of the neural networks. Data cleaning could also involve removing irrelevant or corrupted images from the datasets. Furthermore, data augmentation techniques like rotation, zooming, or cropping might have been employed to increase the amount of available training data and improve the robustness of the models. Nevertheless, without further information, these assumptions remain speculative.
