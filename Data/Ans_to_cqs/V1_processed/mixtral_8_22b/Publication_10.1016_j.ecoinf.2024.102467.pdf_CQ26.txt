To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets or strata, ensuring each subset maintains the same distribution of classes as the original dataset. This technique helps prevent class imbalance issues when partitioning datasets into training and testing sets.

Oversampling is a method used to increase the representation of minority classes by duplicating examples from those classes. This approach aims to balance the dataset and mitigate the impact of class imbalances on model performance. Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is one popular oversampling algorithm that generates new synthetic instances rather than simply copying existing ones.

Undersampling, conversely, reduces the size of majority classes by randomly removing examples from them. By doing so, this technique attempts to create a more balanced dataset without introducing artificial instances. However, it may lead to loss of valuable information if not applied carefully.

Lastly, diverse data collection focuses on gathering a wide range of representative samples to ensure the dataset accurately reflects real-world scenarios. Collecting diverse data can help minimize biases introduced by limited or unrepresentative datasets.

These techniques should be chosen based on the specific characteristics and challenges present in the dataset being used for deep learning tasks.
