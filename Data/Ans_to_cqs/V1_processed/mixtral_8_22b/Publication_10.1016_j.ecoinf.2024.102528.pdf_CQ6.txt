The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it can be generally assumed that these common preprocessing techniques might be employed depending on the nature of the data being used for training the model. For instance, if audio recordings of bird vocalizations are used as input data, then some possible preprocessing steps could include noise reduction, filtering, segmentation, and feature extraction. These steps would help improve the quality of the input data and enhance the performance of the deep learning model during training.
