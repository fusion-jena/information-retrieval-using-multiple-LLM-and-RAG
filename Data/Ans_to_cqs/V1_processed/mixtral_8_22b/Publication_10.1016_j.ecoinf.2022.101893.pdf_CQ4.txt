Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, scaling, etc., being applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does state that Bai et al. used data enhancement technology to improve the detection performance of birds in BirdCLEF 2020. Data enhancement can refer to various methods including data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotation, scaling, among others. Therefore, while we cannot confirm exactly which data augmentation techniques were employed, it is clear that some form of data enhancement was utilized to enhance the performance of their deep learning model.
