Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available from the given context to determine the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, common practices include splitting the dataset randomly into three parts: training, testing, and validation sets. Typically, the ratio used is 70% for training, 15% for testing, and 15% for validation. This allows the model to learn patterns from the majority of the data during training, evaluate its performance with unseen data during testing, and fine-tune hyperparameters during validation.
