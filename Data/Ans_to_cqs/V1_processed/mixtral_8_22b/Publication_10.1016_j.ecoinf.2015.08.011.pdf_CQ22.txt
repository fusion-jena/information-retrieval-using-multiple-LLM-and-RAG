In this study, the performance of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model is evaluated using the Mean Square Error (MSE) metric. The MSE measures the average squared difference between the predicted values and the actual values. A lower MSE indicates better performance of the model. The optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer and the optimal learning rate are determined based on the minimum MSE obtained through a trial-and-error method. However, it should be noted that other metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score could also be used depending on the specific requirements and objectives of the study.
