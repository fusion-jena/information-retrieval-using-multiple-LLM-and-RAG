After the model has been trained, there are several postprocessing steps that can be taken to evaluate its performance and understand its decision-making process. Some examples include:

* Calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to quantify how well the model is performing. This can help identify any issues or areas where the model may need improvement. In this case, the accuracy calculation was performed for each model trained on the corresponding period and was computed using the sklearn library.
* Creating confusion matrices to visualize the model's performance across different classes. A confusion matrix shows the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative rates for each class, providing insight into where the model is making mistakes.
* Generating saliency maps to highlight the parts of the input image that had the greatest impact on the model's prediction. This can provide valuable insights into what features the model is focusing on when making decisions.
* Visualizing the model's weights and activations to gain a better understanding of how it is processing the input data. This can help identify any potential issues or biases in the model.

Overall, these postprocessing steps can provide valuable insights into the model's performance and decision-making process, helping to improve its accuracy and reliability.
