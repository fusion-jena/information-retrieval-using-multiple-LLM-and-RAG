Based on the given information, there isn't any explicit mention of the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the authors have created their own dataset called 'FishInTurbidWater'. This suggests that they might have employed some form of data collection technique such as underwater cameras or sensors to gather images or videos of fishes in turbid water conditions. Unfortunately, without more specific details about the data collection process, it is not possible to definitively determine the exact methods used.
