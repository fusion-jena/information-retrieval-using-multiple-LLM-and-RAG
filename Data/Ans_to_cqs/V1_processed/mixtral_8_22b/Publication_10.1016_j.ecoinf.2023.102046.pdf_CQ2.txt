Based on the given context, the deep learning pipelines discussed primarily involve image data. Specifically, CLIP, ResNet-50, and Inception-V3 are all mentioned as being used for image classification tasks. CLIP was trained on 400 million images from the web along with their captions. ResNet-50 and Inception-V3 are both convolutional neural network models used for image classification. The context does not mention any other types of data formats such as audio, video, or CSV files. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning pipelines discussed here mainly use image data.
