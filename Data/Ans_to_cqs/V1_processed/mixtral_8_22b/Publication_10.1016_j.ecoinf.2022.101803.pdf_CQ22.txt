The text does not provide information about the specific evaluation metrics used for the deep learning models. However, it mentions two metrics used to assess the performance of the models: R^2 and R^2_DEV. These metrics are used to compare the predicted values generated by the models against the actual observed values. Specifically, R^2 measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables, while R^2_DEV is a modified version of R^2 that takes into account the logarithmic transformation of the response variable. It should be noted that these metrics are commonly used in regression analysis rather than classification tasks, where metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall would typically be employed.
