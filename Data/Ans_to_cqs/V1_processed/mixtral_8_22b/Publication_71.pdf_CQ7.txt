The context does not provide explicit information on the criteria used to split the dataset into training, testing, and validation sets for the DeepLabV3+ model. However, it mentions that a significant amount of training data is required, including a near-infrared (NIR) band along with RGB bands. It also suggests using large batch sizes for efficient training. Additionally, since the original DeepLabV3+ architecture was designed for three input channels (RGB), modifications would be necessary to accommodate four-channel input images (RGB + NIR). These adjustments might involve either training a new model from scratch or modifying the architecture to learn weights for the additional image bands while initializing the RGB input channel weights through transfer learning.

In general, datasets are often divided based on certain criteria to ensure the robustness and reliability of machine learning models. Common practices include random splitting, stratified sampling, or time-based splits. Random splitting involves dividing the dataset randomly into different subsets, ensuring each subset has a representative distribution of classes. Stratified sampling maintains the same class proportions across all subsets. Time-based splits are useful when dealing with temporal data, where the chronological order must be preserved during division. The specific choice of splitting method depends on the nature of the problem and the available data.
