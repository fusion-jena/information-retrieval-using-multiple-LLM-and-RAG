Based on the given context, there isn't specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, generally speaking, some common methods for gathering raw data include surveys, various types of sensors such as cameras or motion detectors, and publicly available datasets. For instance, in wildlife surveillance, remote sensing technologies like camera traps could be employed to collect images of animals. Additionally, existing databases containing animal photos might serve as valuable resources for acquiring relevant data. Nevertheless, without explicit details from the provided text, these examples should only be considered as potential approaches rather than definitive answers.
