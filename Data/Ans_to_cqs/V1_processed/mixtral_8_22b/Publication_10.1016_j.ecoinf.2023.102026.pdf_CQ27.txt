The article does not provide information about deploying a trained deep learning model or any specific details regarding model serialization or platform selection. Instead, it focuses on using Random Forest (RF) machine learning models for species distribution modeling. The authors describe two approaches for generating species distribution probabilities: one based on multi-scale environmental variables and another using a bootstrapped RF method. They do not discuss deploying these models after training them.
