The text mentions that during the training stage, simple augmentation strategies are applied to the cropped square patches. These include flipping the patches horizontally and vertically with a 50% probability. However, it does not explicitly mention any other data augmentation techniques such as rotation or scaling. Therefore, based on the given information, the only data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline are horizontal and vertical flips.
