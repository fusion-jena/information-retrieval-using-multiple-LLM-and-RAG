The text does not provide explicit information about the method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of a dataset, which could imply that publicly available datasets or previously collected data were used. Additionally, there is mention of data augmentation techniques being applied to increase the number of images, suggesting that visual data was involved. Therefore, while the exact method of data collection is not specified, it can be inferred that publicly available datasets containing visual data were likely used.
