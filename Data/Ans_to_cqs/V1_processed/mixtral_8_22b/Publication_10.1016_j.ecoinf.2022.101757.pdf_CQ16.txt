The given context does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, common criteria used to determine when training is complete include reaching a validation loss plateau, achieving a desired level of accuracy or performance on a validation set, or exceeding a predefined number of epochs or iterations. These criteria help ensure that the model has learned from the data without overfitting or underfitting. Without additional context, it is not possible to specify which criteria were used in this particular study.
