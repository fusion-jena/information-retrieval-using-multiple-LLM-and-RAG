Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, or scaling used in the deep learning pipelines for vegetation species discrimination and semantic segmentation of Brazilian savanna vegetation using high spatial resolution satellite data and U-Net. However, it can be inferred from the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and fully convolutional networks (FCNs) that common data augmentation techniques may have been employed to improve model performance and prevent overfitting. These techniques could include image transformations like horizontal and vertical flips, rotations, translations, zooming, cropping, and shearing. Additionally, color space augmentations such as brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue adjustments might also have been utilized. Nevertheless, without further information, a definitive list of data augmentation techniques cannot be confirmed.
