The text does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of the'set.seed' function in R, which is often used to ensure reproducibility by setting the starting point for generating random numbers. This implies that one strategy to handle randomness might be to set a specific seed value to ensure consistent results across different runs of the model. Additionally, the text suggests using more predictor variables and writing a custom algorithm, which could potentially help manage randomness by providing more input features or a tailored method for dealing with uncertainty. Lastly, evaluating the performance of the model using real-world examples instead of solely relying on training and testing datasets can offer insights into how well the model handles randomness present in actual data.
