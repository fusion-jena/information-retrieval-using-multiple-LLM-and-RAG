The text mentions several types of deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), DenseNet-201, GoogLeNet, ResNet-101, ResNet-18, VGG-16, and VGG-19. However, the main focus seems to be on CNN architectures. Specifically, the table shows various layers of a CNN architecture, including convolution, pooling, dropout, global average pooling, and dense layers. Therefore, it can be concluded that the pipeline primarily uses a CNN model for its operations.
