In this study, several data augmentation techniques were applied to increase the robustness and transferability of the model predictions. Specifically, image augmentation procedures were used to inflate the amount of training data and help the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) learn spatial features independently of the data acquisition. The image augmentation techniques included horizontal and vertical flipping, as well as adjusting the contrast, saturation, and brightness of the images. The contrast, saturation, and brightness were adjusted within a factor range of 0.9 to 1.1 each. After applying these adjustments, the pixel values were clipped to a range between 0 and 1 to prevent the value range from expanding.
