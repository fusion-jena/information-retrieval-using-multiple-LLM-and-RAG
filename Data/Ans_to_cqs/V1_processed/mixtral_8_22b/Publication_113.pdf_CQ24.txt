The provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing the impact of random seed values. However, some general approaches to manage randomness include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, employing ensemble methods, or averaging multiple runs with different initializations. These techniques help mitigate the effects of randomness and improve the robustness of deep learning models.
