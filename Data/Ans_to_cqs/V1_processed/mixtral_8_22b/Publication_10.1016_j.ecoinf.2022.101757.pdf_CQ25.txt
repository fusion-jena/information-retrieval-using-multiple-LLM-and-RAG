The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the given context is semantic segmentation or pixel-wise classification. This method is used to locate and delineate both artificial and natural objects in photographs. It enables the extraction of meaningful information from images, such as the detailed delineation of the skyline required for their study. However, due to the loss of effective spatial resolution during the learning process, edges or object boundaries tend to become blurred. To overcome this issue, the authors apply a Conditional Random Fields (CRF) technique, which helps capture fine details and compensates for the limitations of neural networks in generating precisely delineated objects.
