Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information regarding specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of Transfer Learning (TL), which involves initializing the CNN's weights before fine-tuning them with a new dataset. Furthermore, the context discusses data augmentation, which can be considered a form of preprocessing. Data augmentation is a strategy that enables practitioners to significantly increase the diversity of data available for training models without actually collecting new data. It involves creating modified versions of images in the dataset by applying random transformations that yield believable-looking images. These transformations might include rotating the image, zooming into the image, shifting the image slightly, etc. In summary, while the exact preprocessing steps aren't mentioned, the context suggests the use of data augmentation and transfer learning as part of the process before training a deep learning model.
