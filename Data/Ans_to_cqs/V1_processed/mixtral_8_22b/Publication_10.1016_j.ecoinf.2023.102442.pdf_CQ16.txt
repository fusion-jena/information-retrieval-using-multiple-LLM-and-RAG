The text does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, based on common practices in machine learning, some possible criteria include reaching a certain number of epochs, achieving a desired level of performance on a validation set, or observing no significant improvements in validation loss over several iterations. In this case, since the study uses a stratified random sampling approach to select training sites, it can be assumed that the training process might continue until a satisfactory level of performance is reached on a separate validation dataset.
