The text does not provide explicit information about the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the network was retrained using hand-annotated data for 40 epochs, suggesting that some form of gradient descent optimization technique was likely employed. Common optimization techniques used in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp), and others. Without further context, it cannot be definitively stated which specific optimization technique was utilized in this case.
