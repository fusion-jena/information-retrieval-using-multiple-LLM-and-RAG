The post-processing steps mentioned in the given context involve transforming the results of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) into an easily accessible Geographic Information System (GIS) resource. The primary goal is to produce and refine the material covering southern Sweden and make it readily available for further analysis.

The first step involves rounding off the pixel predictions from the CNN. All predictions with values greater than 0.5 are considered as wetlands, while those below are classified as non-wetlands. This process generates a raster image where each pixel represents whether it belongs to a wetland or not.

Next, the raster representation is converted into a vector representation. This transformation enables further analysis and reduces storage space, facilitating distribution. However, no specific details about creating saliency maps, calculating metrics, or generating confusion matrices were explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, these aspects might not be directly related to the post-processing steps described here.
