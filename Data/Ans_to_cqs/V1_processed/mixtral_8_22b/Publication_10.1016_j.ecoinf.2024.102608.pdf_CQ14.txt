The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a randomized grid search method (Bergstra & Bengio, 2012; Lee et al., 2022). Unlike traditional grid search, this optimization technique randomly selects subsets of the parameter grid to explore instead of exhaustively searching through all possible combinations of hyperparameters. Randomized grid search offers several advantages such as reduced computational cost, especially when dealing with a large number of hyperparameters, and finding equally or more optimal solutions than an exhaustive grid search, particularly when some hyperparameters are more influential than others. In this study, various cases were generated by combining hyperparameter values extracted from a uniform distribution, and their performance was evaluated. The optimal hyperparameter values for each machine learning model were determined using this method.
