The given context primarily discusses various aspects of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), specifically focusing on their application in Approach 2 of a certain study involving bivalve images. From the context, it can be inferred that the data format used in this deep learning pipeline is image data.

The text mentions several pre-trained networks such as EfficientNet-B0, ResNet101, MobileNetV2, and InceptionV3, which are known to work well with image data. These networks use raw bivalve images as inputs and extract millions of possible features that might not be visible to the human eye. This process is facilitated by the built-in architectures of these deep networks.

Furthermore, the context refers to global average pooling (GAP), which is typically applied to the outputs of convolutional layers in a CNN. GAP computes the spatial average of the feature maps at the end section of the convolutional layer. This operation is commonly used when dealing with image data.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we can conclude that the data format used in this deep learning pipeline is image data. Other data formats like audio, video, or CSV files are not mentioned or implied in the given context.
