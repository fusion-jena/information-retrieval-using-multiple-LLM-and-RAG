The deep learning model developed in this paper was designed to make day-ahead predictions of three pollutants. To evaluate the performance of this model, appropriate evaluation metrics needed to be selected. According to the text, the top metrics for regression problems are Mean Squared Error (MSE)/Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). However, it does not explicitly state whether these metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. Nevertheless, based on the information available, we can infer that MSE/RMSE and MAE could potentially be used to assess the performance of the deep learning model.
