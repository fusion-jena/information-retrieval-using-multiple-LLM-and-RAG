The text does not provide explicit information about the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it mentions that future studies could use more sophisticated methods like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or deep learning techniques for automated cattle detection. This suggests that these types of models might be suitable for this task but doesn't confirm they were actually used in the described work.
