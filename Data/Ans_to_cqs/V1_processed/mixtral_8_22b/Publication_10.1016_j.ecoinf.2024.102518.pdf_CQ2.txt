Based on the given context, it does not provide explicit details about the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer from the context that the authors utilized various types of data such as occurrence data and environmental variables. These could be in different formats like CSV, Excel, or other tabular data formats commonly used for storing and analyzing structured data. Additionally, there might also be spatial data involved due to the mention of 'domestic study region,' which suggests geographical coordinates or maps being part of the dataset. Unfortunately, without more specific information regarding the exact nature of the data used, it isn't possible to definitively state whether formats like image, audio, or video were included in the deep learning pipeline.
