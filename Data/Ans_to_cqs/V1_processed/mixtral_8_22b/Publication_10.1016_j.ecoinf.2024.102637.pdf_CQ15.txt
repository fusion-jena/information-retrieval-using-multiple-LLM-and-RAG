The text does not explicitly mention any specific optimization techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, etc. However, it discusses several optimization strategies employed in the deep learning pipeline. These include meticulous algorithm optimization and structural design aimed at maintaining model performance while reducing computational complexity and deployment costs.

One strategy mentioned involves merging two convolution layers in the model deployment mode, which ensures that the nonlinear factors caused by the activation function are not reduced. By reducing the number of layers in the model, the computational efficiency is improved, and the inference time of the model is significantly shortened.

Additionally, the use of normalization layers accelerates training and prevents overfitting. Down-sampling operations reduce the size of the input feature map, effectively decreasing the amount of data while retaining essential features. This reduces the amount of calculation required by the model.

Furthermore, the method of cascading multiple activation functions introduces nonlinear factors so that the model approximates the nonlinear expression function of the learning features. This also improves the gradient propagation.

While these strategies do not directly correspond to specific optimization algorithms like SGD or Adam, they represent broader optimization approaches within the deep learning pipeline.
