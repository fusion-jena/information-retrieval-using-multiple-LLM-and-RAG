In the given context, several datasets were mentioned as being used in the deep learning pipeline. These include the URPC dataset, which consists of 1201 images containing four object categories: holothurian, echinus, scallop, and starfish. For the experiments, the experimental data was divided into training and test sets following an 8:2 ratio, resulting in a training set of 956 images and a test set of 244 images. Additionally, the paper mentions conducting tests on five more datasets to evaluate the generalization capabilities of YWnet. These datasets include Aquarium, Trash-ICRA19, VisDrone, NWPU VHR-10, and HRSID. Aquarium and Trash-ICRA19 are part of the Marine Dataset, which comprises marine animals and waste categories. However, specific details about the number of images or classes in each of these datasets are not explicitly stated in the provided context.
