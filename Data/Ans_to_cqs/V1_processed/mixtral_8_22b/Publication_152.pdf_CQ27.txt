The article does not provide explicit information on how the trained deep learning model was deployed after training. However, based on common practices in machine learning and deep learning projects, we can infer some possible steps for deployment. After training a deep learning model like U-Net, it is typically saved or serialized into a file format such as.h5,.pt, or.pb, depending on the framework used (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.). This serialized model can then be loaded onto various platforms for inference, including cloud services, edge devices, or even mobile applications. In this case, since the authors mention using RGB images captured by a UAV as input for their final network, they might have chosen to deploy the model on a platform compatible with real-time image processing from drones. Unfortunately, without specific details about the deployment process, we cannot determine which exact method or platform was selected for deploying the trained deep learning model.
