The text does not explicitly mention which specific type of deep learning model is being used in the proposed pipeline. However, it does state that the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model has been popularly used for image recognition tasks. It should be noted that XGBoost is not a traditional deep learning model but rather a tree ensemble method. Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot definitively determine whether a convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), or transformer model is being employed in this case. Further clarification would be required from additional sources or documentation related to this research project.
