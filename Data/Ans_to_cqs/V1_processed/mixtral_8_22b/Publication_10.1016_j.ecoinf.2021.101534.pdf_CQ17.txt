The text does not provide explicit information about specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, it mentions two strategies employed to address the issue of limited data and potentially mitigate overfitting: transfer learning and data augmentation.

Transfer learning involves utilizing pretrained models from large datasets and fine-tuning them on smaller target datasets. This technique allows the model to leverage previously learned features and reduces the need for extensive training data. In this case, the authors use YOLOv5s, which is likely a pretrained model, to build their sound identification model.

Data augmentation is another strategy mentioned in the text to enhance the diversity of the training dataset. By applying various transformations to the existing data, such as changing frequency, pitch, and volume, shifting, rotating, and zooming in the time and/or frequency domains of spectrograms, and adding additional noise, the authors aim to create a more representative dataset. This approach helps improve the model's performance when trained on a small dataset and could indirectly contribute to reducing overfitting.

While these techniques do not directly correspond to traditional regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization, they serve similar purposes in preventing overfitting and improving model generalization.
