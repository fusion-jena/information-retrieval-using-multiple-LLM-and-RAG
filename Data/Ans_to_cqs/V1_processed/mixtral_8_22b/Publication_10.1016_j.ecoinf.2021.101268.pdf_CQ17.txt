The text does not provide information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, common regularization methods include dropout, L1 regularization, and L2 regularization. Dropout randomly drops out neurons during training to prevent overfitting, while L1 and L2 regularization add penalties to the loss function to reduce the complexity of the model.
