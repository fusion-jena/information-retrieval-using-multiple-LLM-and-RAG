The hyperparameters of the model were determined using Grid Search. This can be seen from TABLE II which lists the Hyperparameters Determined Using Grid Search. These include Batch Size, Learning Rate, Parameters # of Epochs, and Input Image Size for various models such as Inception-V3, MobileNet-V2, ResNet-18, and DenseNet-121.
