In the given context, while specific regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned, some hyperparameters related to regularization can be identified. Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function, discouraging complex models.

Two types of regularization methods are implicitly referenced in the context: L1 regularization and L2 regularization. These are also known as Lasso and Ridge regularizations, respectively. L1 regularization adds an absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients as penalty to the loss function, whereas L2 regularization adds the squared magnitude of coefficients.

In the context,'reg_alpha', 'lambda_l1','reg_lambda', and 'lambda_l2' are hyperparameters associated with regularization. Specifically,'reg_alpha' and'reg_lambda' correspond to L1 and L2 regularization terms, respectively. Similarly, 'lambda_l1' and 'lambda_l2' represent the weights assigned to the L1 and L2 regularization terms, controlling their influence on the overall loss function.

However, other common regularization methods like Dropout and Early Stopping are not directly discussed in the provided context. Dropout randomly sets a fraction rate of input units to 0 at each update during training time, helping to prevent overfitting. On the other hand, Early Stopping monitors the validation error and stops training when the error starts increasing, indicating that the model might be starting to overfit.
