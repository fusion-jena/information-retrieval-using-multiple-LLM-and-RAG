The given context does not provide explicit information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it mentions some general practices related to data processing and preparation.

During the training stage, the authors experimented with various patch sizes (256, 320, 480, 640, and 800 pixels). They also applied a simple augmentation strategy, which involves flipping the patches horizontally and vertically with a 50% probability. This technique can help reduce potential biases caused by the orientation of objects within the images.

For the validation phase, they divided the images into regularly spaced, overlapping patches using the same size employed during training. These patches were processed individually, and the overall output was reconstructed by combining the predictions from the patches. The use of overlapping patches might contribute to reducing any potential spatial bias introduced by cropping the original images.

Although the context does not directly mention techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, the described methods could still indirectly mitigate certain types of data bias. Nonetheless, without further details regarding class distribution, sampling strategies, or data sources, it remains unclear whether these specific techniques have been implemented.
