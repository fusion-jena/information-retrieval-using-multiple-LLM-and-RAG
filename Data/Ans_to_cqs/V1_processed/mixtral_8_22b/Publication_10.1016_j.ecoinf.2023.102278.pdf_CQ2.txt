Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline uses image data format. This can be inferred from several parts of the text. Firstly, the table presents average performance and standard deviation for five trained models, all of which are based on either ResNet50 or EfficientNetB3 architectures, both of which are designed for processing image data. Secondly, the mention of bounding boxes further supports the use of image data, as they are typically associated with object detection tasks in computer vision. Lastly, the description of data augmentation techniques like image scaling, flipping, distorting, and adding color jitter also indicates that the pipeline processes image data. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning pipeline primarily uses image data format.
