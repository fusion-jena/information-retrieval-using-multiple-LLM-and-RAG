The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific evaluation metrics used for the deep learning model mentioned in the paper by Mohedano et al. However, based on common practices in evaluating deep learning models, some possible metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of total instances; precision is the ratio of true positive predictions to all predicted positives; recall is the ratio of true positive predictions to actual positives; and F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. Additionally, the table presented in the context might indicate the use of these or other similar metrics, such as Total Accuracy, MI (possibly Mean Intersection), LI (possibly Label Intersection), and their respective percentages. Without further clarification from the authors or additional context, it cannot be definitively stated which exact metrics were employed.
