To ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model, the authors employed several strategies. Firstly, they utilized diverse datasets consisting of images with varying qualities and complexities. This approach helped prevent overfitting and improved the model's ability to handle real-world variations. Secondly, they performed between-dataset classifications, where the model was trained on one dataset (source dataset) and tested on another (target dataset). This method allowed them to evaluate how well the model could adapt to new, unseen data. Lastly, they also considered the impact of the number of images available for training, acknowledging that having access to large amounts of images per taxon significantly improves the performance of convolutional neural network (CNN)-based classification models.
