The text does not provide explicit information about how the data was split for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, it mentions that models were trained and tested by tuning the number of epochs and checking for signs of overfitting. This suggests that some form of cross-validation or holdout method may have been employed during the training process. Unfortunately, without further details, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the specific criteria used to split the data.
