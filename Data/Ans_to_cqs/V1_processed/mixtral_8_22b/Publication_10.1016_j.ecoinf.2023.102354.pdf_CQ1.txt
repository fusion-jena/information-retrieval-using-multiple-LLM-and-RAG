The text does not provide specific information on the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that SMS data was obtained using GLDAS observations from 2002 to 2017. GLDAS stands for Global Land Data Assimilation System, which integrates satellite and ground-based observational data. This suggests that remote sensing data might be one of the sources for collecting raw data. Additionally, the table summarizes various datasets with their spatial and temporal resolutions and sources, including TWS, SMS, GWS, SPEI-3, 6 and 12, ENSO, NAO, AMO, PDO, IOD, Ni単o 1+2, Ni単o 3.0, Ni単o 3.4, Ni単o 4, NTA, STA, and ETA. These datasets could potentially serve as inputs for the deep learning pipeline.
