Based on the given context, it appears that the primary source of raw data collection for the deep learning pipeline is satellite imagery. Satellites equipped with specific sensors capture images of Earth's surface, providing valuable data about land cover and land use. These images serve as input for training deep learning models like the U-Net model mentioned in the text. It is important to note that the availability of labeled data is crucial for the application of such models. While the context does not explicitly mention other methods for collecting raw data, common sources include ground surveys, sensor networks, and publicly available datasets. However, the focus here seems to be on utilizing satellite imagery for land monitoring purposes.
