The given context does not provide information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It discusses the use of remote sensing data from satellites like Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8, along with machine learning approaches, to estimate water quality parameters in reservoirs. However, it does not mention any specific data repositories or platforms used for storing or sharing this data. Therefore, without additional context, it is impossible to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
