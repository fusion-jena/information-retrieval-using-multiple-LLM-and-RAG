The text does not provide information about the use of deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers in the pipeline. Instead, it mentions the use of several machine learning models like Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Random Forest (RF), and Classification and Regression Tree (CART) for species distribution modeling. These models do not fall under the category of deep learning models. Therefore, based on the given context, no specific deep learning model has been mentioned as being part of the pipeline.
