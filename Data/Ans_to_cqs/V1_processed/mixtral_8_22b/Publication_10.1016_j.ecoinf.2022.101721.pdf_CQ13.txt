The given context does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in any deep learning model. The context discusses various aspects such as prediction methods for means, standard deviations, and population sizes based on observed data, species identification using machine learning, inclusion of all observations in statistical modeling, and implementation of Bayesian algorithms. However, it does not mention any details regarding the use of deep learning models or their associated hyperparameters like learning rates or optimizers. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information based on the given context.
