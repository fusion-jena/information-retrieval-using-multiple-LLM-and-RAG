The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific strategies used to monitor the model performance during training. However, there are some relevant points regarding the use of machine learning tools for image classification and the need for high-quality input data. It appears that the authors used NAIP (National Agriculture Imagery Program) and massive training datasets for their models, which could potentially lead to good performance. They also mentioned the importance of considering the limitations of machine learning methods, particularly when dealing with historical imagery that might have varying characteristics like blurriness and distortion. To ensure accurate results, the authors emphasized the necessity of further testing. Nevertheless, without explicit details about monitoring strategies, one cannot definitively state what approach was taken to evaluate the model performance during training.
