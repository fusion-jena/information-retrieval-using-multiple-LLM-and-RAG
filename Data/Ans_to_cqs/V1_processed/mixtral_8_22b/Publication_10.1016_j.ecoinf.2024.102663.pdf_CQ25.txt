The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is primarily focused on fish biomass estimation. Deep learning models are being developed to provide accurate biomass estimates without causing unnecessary strain to the fish or requiring extensive manual effort. These models are designed to work effectively even in challenging environments, such as those characterized by turbidity, low light, extreme occlusion, or overlapping of fish.

To achieve this, the deep learning model may incorporate various architectures and techniques. For instance, it might utilize semantic segmentation, which involves classifying each pixel in an image into a category, such as 'fish' or 'background'. This technique can help in accurately identifying and quantifying fish biomass.

Moreover, the model might also employ object detection techniques, like YOLO (You Only Look Once), to locate individual fish instances within images. This can aid in counting the number of fish present, which is another crucial aspect of biomass estimation.

Additionally, the model might leverage Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks along with Global Vectors (GloVe) embeddings. These tools can improve the detection and classification of different fish species within the dataset, thereby enhancing the overall precision of fish biomass estimates.

In summary, the primary purpose of the deep learning model discussed here is to estimate fish biomass accurately and efficiently, using techniques such as semantic segmentation, object detection, and advanced embedding methods.
