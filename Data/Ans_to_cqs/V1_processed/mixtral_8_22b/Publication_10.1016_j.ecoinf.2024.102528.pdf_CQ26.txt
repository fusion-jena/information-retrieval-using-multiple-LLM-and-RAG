The paper does not provide explicit information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions using the BirdNET-Analyzer deep learning model, which has been trained on diverse datasets to recognize a wide range of bird species. This suggests that diverse data collection could be one technique employed to mitigate potential biases in the dataset. Other common methods for addressing data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling. These techniques help ensure that the training set is representative of the overall population and can improve the performance of the deep learning model. Without more detailed information about the preprocessing steps taken in this study, it is difficult to determine if these additional techniques were utilized.
