The text does not explicitly state the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, it mentions that the best performing model based on the validation loss was saved after 3000 iterations. This suggests that the training might have been stopped once the validation loss reached its minimum or started to increase again, indicating overfitting. Therefore, one possible criterion could be reaching a validation loss plateau or observing signs of overfitting. Another possibility is simply stopping the training after a fixed number of iterations, such as 3000 iterations in this case. Without further information, we cannot definitively confirm which criteria were used.
