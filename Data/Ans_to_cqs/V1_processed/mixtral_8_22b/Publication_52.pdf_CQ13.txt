Based on the given context, there isn't specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. However, we can infer some details about the model's structure and components.

The text mentions that the deep learning model uses a Single-Hidden Layer Feed Forward Neural Network (SLFFNN) with N hidden neurons. The input weights and biases in the hidden layer are randomly selected, while the output weights are calculated through a single multiplication of vector matrices.

Additionally, the model incorporates an Online Sequential Multilayer algorithm and a Graph Regularized Extreme Learning Machine Autoencoder. These elements aim to optimize the choice of input layer weights and bias, ultimately improving the model's generalization capabilities.

However, without explicit mention of the learning rate, optimizer, or other common hyperparameters, it is difficult to provide a definitive list of those used in this particular deep learning model.
