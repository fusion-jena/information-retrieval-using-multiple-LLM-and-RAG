In the given context, the authors mention using a ResNet50 model pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset for their deep learning pipeline. ImageNet is a large-scale image database containing millions of labeled images organized into thousands of categories or classes. It has been widely used as a benchmark dataset for various computer vision tasks, including object recognition, classification, and localization. By leveraging transfer learning, the researchers were able to utilize the knowledge gained from training on ImageNet to improve the performance of their own model when applied to spectrogram classification tasks. No other specific datasets are mentioned in the provided context.
