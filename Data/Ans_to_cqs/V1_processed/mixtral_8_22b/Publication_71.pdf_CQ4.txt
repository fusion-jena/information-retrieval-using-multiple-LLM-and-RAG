The authors mention several data augmentation techniques that can be employed to improve the performance of deep learning models when dealing with imbalanced datasets or when there are differences between the characteristics of the training and testing data. These techniques include adjusting brightness levels, creating vertical and horizontal flips of the original images, shifting, rotating, and introducing noise into the training images. By employing such techniques, it becomes possible to increase the diversity of the training set without actually collecting additional data, which can help prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.
