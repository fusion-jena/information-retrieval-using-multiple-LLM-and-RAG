The text mentions that the neural network used in the pipeline is a convolutional neural network (CNN). Specifically, it uses a variant called C2f module, which is designed for multi-level deep processing and abstraction of input features. This module is inspired by the C3 module and Efficient Layer Aggregation Network (ELAN) to realize additional cross-layer connections across branches. Additionally, another module mentioned is the Spatial Pyramid Pooling - Fast (SPPF) module, which also operates within the framework of a CNN. Therefore, the deep learning model used in this pipeline is primarily based on CNN architecture.
