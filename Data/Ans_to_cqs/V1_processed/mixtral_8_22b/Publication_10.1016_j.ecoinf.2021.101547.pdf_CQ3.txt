The given context does not explicitly mention any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does discuss the use of a pre-trained ResNet-50 model for object detection, specifically for identifying polar bears. This implies that some form of labeled data was likely used to train this model, but the exact method of labeling (bounding boxes, polygons, semantic segmentation, etc.) remains unspecified in the provided information.
