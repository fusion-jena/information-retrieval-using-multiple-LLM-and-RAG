The dataset used in this study is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, it can be inferred from Table 1 that the dataset consists of vocalizations or sounds produced by animals, specifically songs with different patterns and variants. This dataset was likely collected through tracking methods, as indicated by the table title and column headers. Unfortunately, without more specific information about the dataset, I cannot provide further details regarding its source or any potential similarities to well-known datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
