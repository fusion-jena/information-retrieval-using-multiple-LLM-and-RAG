The given context does not directly discuss regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, I will briefly explain these techniques for your understanding.

Regularization methods help reduce overfitting in machine learning models, including deep learning pipelines. Two common regularization techniques are Dropout and L2 Regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent complex co-adaptations on training data. In other words, dropout temporarily removes some units along with their connections from the neural network during training, forcing the model to learn redundant representations of features.

L2 Regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. This encourages smaller weights, leading to simpler models and reducing overfitting.

These regularization methods are often employed when building deep learning models to improve generalization performance and avoid overfitting.
