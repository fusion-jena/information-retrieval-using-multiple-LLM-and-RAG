The paper by Rustia et al. (2021) mentions the use of a deep learning pipeline for insect identification but does not provide any specific information about the code repository link. Similarly, the papers by Wang et al. (2020a, 2020b, 2020c) also discuss the use of deep learning models for pest detection and classification but do not mention any code repository links. However, there are some other resources mentioned in the given context that might be helpful. For instance, Skalski (2019) provides a link to a GitHub repository called'make-sense', which could potentially contain relevant code for building a deep learning pipeline. Additionally, the SmartProtect platform (2022) offers a search function that may lead to useful resources related to pest detection and classification. Unfortunately, without more specific information or references, it is difficult to determine the exact code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in these studies.
