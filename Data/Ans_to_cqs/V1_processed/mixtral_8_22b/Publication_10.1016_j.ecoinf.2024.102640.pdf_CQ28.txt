The given context does not provide information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It only mentions that the model was trained on a server with an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 3090 GPU but does not specify where it was deployed after training. Therefore, I do not have enough information to determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
