The given context does not provide any direct reference to the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, it can be assumed that the authors might have shared their codes in a public repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. To find the exact link, one would need to search for the paper title or author names along with keywords like 'code','repository', 'GitHub', etc. on popular search engines or academic databases. Unfortunately, without additional information, it is impossible to determine the specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context.
