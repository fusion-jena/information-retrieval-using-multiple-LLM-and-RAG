Based on the given information, it appears that the authors are utilizing machine learning techniques, including Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), to build predictive models. However, there isn't explicit mention of a deep learning model being employed. Deep learning typically involves neural networks with multiple hidden layers, which can be used for various tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and more.

From the available context, it seems that the primary goal of these models is prediction rather than classification, segmentation, or detection. Specifically, they aim to forecast the first flowering date and full blossom date based on meteorological factors. This suggests that the models might be regression models, where the objective is to estimate continuous outcomes instead of categorical ones. Therefore, it would be incorrect to assert that this study uses a deep learning model for classification, segmentation, or detection purposes.
