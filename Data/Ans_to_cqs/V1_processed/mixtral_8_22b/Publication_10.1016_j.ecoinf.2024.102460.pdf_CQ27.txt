Based on the given context, it appears that the study uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for predicting time series data. However, the specific details regarding the deployment of the trained deep learning model are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. Therefore, I cannot provide a precise answer to how the trained deep learning model was deployed, such as whether it involved model serialization or platform selection. It would be best to refer to the original research paper or related materials for more detailed information about the deployment process.
