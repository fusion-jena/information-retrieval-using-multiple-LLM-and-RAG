Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model used in this research. However, it can be inferred from the methodology section that the authors have employed various techniques such as using diverse datasets, cross-validation, and stratified splitting to improve the robustness and reliability of their models. For instance, they have utilized multiple sources of data including NDVI, vegetation type data, DEM, temperature, precipitation, radiation, road data, GDP data, and population data. Additionally, they have performed downscaling of meteorological data to match the spatial resolution of other input variables. These approaches suggest that the authors have made efforts to enhance the generalizability of their models by incorporating diverse datasets and ensuring consistency across different scales. Nevertheless, without further details regarding the specific methods used for validation or evaluation, it cannot be definitively stated what exact measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
