The text mentions several datasets used in the deep learning pipelines. The first dataset mentioned is the ECUHO-1 and ECUHO-2 datasets, which were used by Noman et al. (2021b). Another dataset mentioned is the ImageNet dataset, which was used to achieve the highest accuracy on the EfficientDet frameworks. Additionally, the text references a study by Waycott et al. (2009) that discusses accelerating loss of seagrasses across the globe, but it does not explicitly mention any specific dataset used in their research. Similarly, the study by Xu et al. (2021) focuses on developing a forest fire detection system based on ensemble learning, but no specific dataset is mentioned. Overall, the text provides information about three datasets used in deep learning pipelines: ECUHO-1, ECUHO-2, and ImageNet.
