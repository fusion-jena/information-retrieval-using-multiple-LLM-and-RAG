The given context does not provide information about the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the framework uses the BirdNET-Analyzer deep learning model for monitoring a large number of bird species based on their vocalizations. Data augmentation techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, padding, and noise injection. These techniques help improve the performance and generalization ability of the model by increasing the diversity of training data without collecting new data. It should be noted that the choice of data augmentation technique depends on the nature of the problem and the characteristics of the input data.
