Unfortunately, there isn't enough context to provide the exact code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The given text does not mention any specific links to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or other code repositories related to the deep learning pipeline. It only discusses the application of different machine learning models, including Enet, SVM, RF, XGBoost, and LightGBM, for predicting canopy cover from Planet data. The authors used Python 3.12.2, distributed by Anaconda Inc., along with several libraries such as Scikit-learn, xgboost, and lightgbm. They also applied a 5-fold cross-validation grid search strategy to tune hyperparameters within the training dataset for all machine learning models. However, no explicit reference to a code repository containing the deep learning pipeline is made in the provided context.
