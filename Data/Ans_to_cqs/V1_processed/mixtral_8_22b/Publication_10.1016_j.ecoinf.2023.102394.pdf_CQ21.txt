Based on the given context, there is no explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it can be inferred from general machine learning practices that common postprocessing steps may include evaluating the performance of the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves, etc. Additionally, techniques like saliency maps could also be used to understand which input features had the most impact on the predictions made by the model. It should be noted that these are only assumptions based on typical machine learning workflows and not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
