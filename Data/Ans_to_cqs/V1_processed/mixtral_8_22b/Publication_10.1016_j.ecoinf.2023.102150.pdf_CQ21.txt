The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices after the model training. However, based on general machine learning practices, we can infer that there could be several postprocessing steps involved after the model training. These may include evaluating the model using various evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score etc. Additionally, creating a confusion matrix can also provide insights into the model's performance by showing which categories were correctly predicted and where the model made mistakes. Visualization techniques like saliency maps can also be used to understand how the model makes its predictions by highlighting important features in the input image. Furthermore, the text mentions manual review of training images to ensure no misclassifications, which can also be considered as part of postprocessing. Lastly, the process of model retraining mentioned in the context involves improving the model performance by adding new training images, which can also be seen as a form of postprocessing step.
