The deep learning model used in this study employed the ResNet-50 architecture, which is a convolutional neural network that is 50 layers deep. The model was trained using the keras package in R with a TensorFlow backend. The hyperparameters used in the model include a learning rate with a one-cycle learning rate policy, having a minimum value of 0.000001 and a maximum value of 0.001. Additionally, the model was trained with 55 epochs and a batch size of 64. However, the specific optimizer used in the model is not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
