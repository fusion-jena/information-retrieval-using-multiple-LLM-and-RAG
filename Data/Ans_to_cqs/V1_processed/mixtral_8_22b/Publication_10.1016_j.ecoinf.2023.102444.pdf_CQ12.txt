Based on the given context, it appears that a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was used in the pipeline for species distribution modeling. The reference to Deneu et al. (2022) mentions the use of a CNN to model the distribution of species at a fine resolution. Additionally, the paper titled "Species distribution modeling based on remote sensing imagery" also suggests the use of CNNs for capturing fine-grained and large-scale vegetation ecology. Therefore, it can be inferred that a CNN was employed in the pipeline for species distribution modeling.
