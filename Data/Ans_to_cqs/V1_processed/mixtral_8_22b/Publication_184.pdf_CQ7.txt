Based on the given context, there isn't explicit mention of how the data was split for training, testing, or validation purposes. However, it can be inferred that the data was divided into training and validation sets based on Table I, which lists the hyperparameters used to train and validate the YOLO model. Additionally, the text mentions that the model improved in terms of precision, recall, and mean average precision before plateauing around 1000 iterations, indicating that the model was evaluated during the training process. It is common practice in machine learning to divide datasets into training, validation, and testing subsets, often using ratios such as 70/15/15 or 80/10/10. Without further specific details, it cannot be determined exactly what criteria were used to split the data in this case.
