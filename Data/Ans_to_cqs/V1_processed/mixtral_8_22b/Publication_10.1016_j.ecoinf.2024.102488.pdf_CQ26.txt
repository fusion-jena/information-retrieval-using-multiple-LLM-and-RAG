The given context does not provide information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it mentions the use of Recursive Feature Elimination and Cross-Validation (RFECV) for feature selection, which can help reduce redundancy caused by multi-source feature datasets and improve model performance. This technique involves removing features with the lowest importance scores recursively until the cross-validation accuracy reaches its highest level. It also uses a five-fold cross-validation to select the number and combinations of features. While this does not directly address data bias, it contributes to improving the overall quality of the dataset and potentially reducing any biases introduced through irrelevant or redundant features.
