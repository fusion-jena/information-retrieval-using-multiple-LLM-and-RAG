In the given context, the authors utilize the Google Image Search engine to collect raw data for their deep learning pipeline. They specifically choose the most popular labels and retrieve the top results from the search engine. This approach allows them to gather a significant amount of labeled data quickly and efficiently. However, they also acknowledge that this automated process may result in some minor mislabeled or corrupt examples appearing in the dataset. To mitigate this issue, they focus on selecting labels with a sufficient number of images and retrieving the top results to minimize the presence of mislabeled images. Overall, the authors rely on publicly available data sources and automated web scraping techniques to build their dataset for deep learning applications.
