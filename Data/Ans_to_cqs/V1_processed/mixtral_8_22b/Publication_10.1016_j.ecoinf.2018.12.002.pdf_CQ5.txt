The given context does not provide information about the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it discusses various machine learning techniques like neural networks, CARTs, linear discriminant analysis, random forests, and support vector machines, along with their application in analyzing animal behavior based on accelerometer (ACC) data. Additionally, it mentions papers related to spatio-temporal analysis, approximate Bayesian computation, error bounds for convolutional codes, and an optimal decoding algorithm. However, none of these sources directly address the use of any particular dataset in a deep learning pipeline.
