Based on the given context, there is no direct mention of specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it does discuss some aspects related to handling data in the deep learning pipeline.

For instance, the text mentions setting the input image size to 512 x 512 and limiting the maximum batch size to 4. It also talks about preventing underfitting by ensuring back-propagation after accumulating the batch size 32 times. These steps could potentially help manage data imbalance issues indirectly.

Moreover, the use of an attention mechanism in the YOLOv5 network is mentioned, which provides different weights to things depending on their significance in a certain visual region. This could also be seen as a way to handle potential data bias, although not explicitly stated as such.

However, without more specific details regarding the dataset and the exact nature of any potential data bias, it would be difficult to definitively state what techniques might have been used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
