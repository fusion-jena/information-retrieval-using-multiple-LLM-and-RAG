The context does not provide explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that between October 2012 and September 2016, 2,786 users listened to 127,451 unique clips and made 605,907 annotations. It can be inferred that the annotation technique used was audio clip labeling or tagging, where users labeled whether a given audio clip contained a bat call or not. Additionally, the text refers to a top user who had viewed 46,508 unique sound clips and had labeled 3,364 clips as containing bat search-phase echolocation calls. This further supports the assumption that the annotation technique used was audio clip labeling or tagging. Unfortunately, there is no mention of any visual annotation techniques such as bounding boxes or instance segmentation since the task involves analyzing audio data rather than images or videos.
