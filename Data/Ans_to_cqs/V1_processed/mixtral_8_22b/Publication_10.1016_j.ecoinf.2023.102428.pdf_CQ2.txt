The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the mention of LULC (Land Use Land Cover) classification and the use of ERDAS IMAGINE software for stratified random sampling, we can infer that the data format used in this case might be related to remote sensing imagery such as satellite images or aerial photographs. These types of data are commonly used in land cover classification tasks. Nevertheless, without more detailed information, we cannot definitively state the exact data format used in the deep learning pipeline.
