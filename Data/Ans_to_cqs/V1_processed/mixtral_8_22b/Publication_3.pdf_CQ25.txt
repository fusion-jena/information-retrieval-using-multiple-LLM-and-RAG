The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the provided context is primarily for image classification tasks and pattern recognition. More specifically, the model uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify species based on their respective audio spectrograms. This is evident through various mentions of'species','spectrograms', and 'classification' throughout the text. Furthermore, the use of CNNs suggests that the primary goal is indeed image classification since CNNs are particularly well suited for such tasks. In summary, the deep learning model aims to accurately classify species based on their unique audio signatures represented visually as spectrograms.
