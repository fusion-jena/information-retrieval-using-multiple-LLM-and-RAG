The paper does not provide information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate response to this query. However, some commonly used optimization techniques in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp), and others. These methods help minimize the loss function during training by adjusting the model parameters iteratively.

Based on the given context, it appears that the research focuses on constructing provincial-scale fitting models using various data types such as land cover, meteorology, socioeconomic factors, and carbon emissions. While these models may involve machine learning or deep learning algorithms, there is no explicit mention of any specific optimization techniques like SGD or Adam being employed in the deep learning pipeline.
