Based on the given context, it can be determined that the deep learning models used in the pipeline are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Specifically, the paper mentions the use of AlexNet and InceptionNet, both of which are popular types of CNN architectures. AlexNet was developed by Krizhevsky et al. in 2012 and consists of multiple convolutional layers for improved high-dimensional feature extraction, followed by three fully connected layers for pooling channel information. On the other hand, InceptionNet was proposed by Szegedy et al. in 2014 and features a unique architecture with poly depth pathways, allowing for enhanced computational resource usage efficiency. It also employs ReLU activations and has better batch normalization capabilities. Therefore, based on these descriptions, we can conclude that the deep learning models used in the pipeline are indeed CNNs.
