The data can be split into three sets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to fit the model, the validation set is used to tune the parameters of the model, and the testing set is used to assess the final performance of the model. The ratio of splitting the data depends on the size of the dataset and the complexity of the problem. Commonly used ratios include 60:40, 80:20, and 90:10 for training and validation or testing respectively. For example, in the given context, the dataset is split into a training set and a validation set using three data split strategies (i.e., 60:40, 80:20, and 90:10) to evaluate the abilities of different models to learn from a larger dataset and identify any underfitting/overfitting issues.
