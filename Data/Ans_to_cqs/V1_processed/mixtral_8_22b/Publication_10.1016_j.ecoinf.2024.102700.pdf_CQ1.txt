The data collection methods mentioned in the provided context include both dedicated surveys and large databases or citizen science social media records. Dedicated surveys can be further classified into visual and acoustic surveys. Visual surveys often use transect methods, while acoustic surveys employ various types of acoustic devices. Additionally, some data is gathered through opportunistic in-situ surveys, which are usually carried out during other research activities focused on different scientific objectives. It should be noted that these data sources may vary in their standardization levels; for instance, data from dedicated surveys tend to be more standardized than those from unstructured sources like large databases or citizen science records.
