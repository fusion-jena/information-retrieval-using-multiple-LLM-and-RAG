The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, there are some aspects mentioned that can contribute to improving the model's performance and potentially its generalizability:

1. Data preprocessing: Input data is resized to 224x224 pixels with RGB format, and batch normalization is applied before training. This standardizes the input data, making it easier for the model to learn from different examples.

2. Optimizer and Activation Function: The Leaky ReLU activation function is used, which helps prevent the vanishing gradient problem during backpropagation. Additionally, the learning rate and dropout rate are both set to 0.001, while the bias value is set to 0. These settings help regulate the learning process and reduce overfitting.

3. Training Epochs: Depending on the number of layers in the model, either 60 or 80 training epochs are performed. Adjusting the number of epochs based on the complexity of the model can help improve its ability to generalize better.

4. Hardware and Software Environment: The experiments are conducted on a CentOS Linux operating system with 32 CPUs, each having 64 processors. The development environment uses Python version 3.6.2, along with tool packages like TensorFlow and NumPy. Having a powerful hardware setup and appropriate software tools can aid in building more robust and accurate models.
