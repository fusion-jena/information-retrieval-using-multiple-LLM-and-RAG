The paper does not provide explicit information about the specific datasets used in their deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions using a dataset containing images of human faces for training and testing purposes. Unfortunately, without more detailed information, we cannot confirm if they used popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
