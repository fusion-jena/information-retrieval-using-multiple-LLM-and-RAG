To evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, two main metrics were used: Intersection over Union (IoU) and Overall Accuracy. The IoU metric measures the overlap between the predicted segmentation map and the ground truth, while the Overall Accuracy measures the percentage of correctly classified pixels. These metrics were computed using a custom implementation of the IoU metric and Equations (1) and (2), respectively. Additionally, a custom metric was implemented to calculate the mean IoU for thresholds between 0.5 and 1, which helped to determine the optimal threshold value for converting probabilities into class labels.
