In this study, the authors use a deep neural network for processing data during model training. They mention adjusting certain hyperparameters such as the training epoch, batch size, and volume size to output a classifier for prediction. However, they do not explicitly state the specific values or ranges used for these hyperparameters. Additionally, they mention setting the learning decay rate to 0.7 but do not provide information about the initial learning rate or the optimizer used. Therefore, while some hyperparameters are mentioned, their exact values or ranges remain unknown.
