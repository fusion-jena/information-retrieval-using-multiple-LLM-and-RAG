The text does not provide information about a deep learning model or its purpose. However, based on the given context, the study focuses on using machine learning techniques, specifically Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms, for species distribution modeling. These methods are applied to analyze camera trap data on several felid species.

Two main approaches were employed in this research: non-bootstrapped RF and bootstrapped RF. In both cases, the goal was to produce species distribution probability surfaces for each felid species. The difference between these approaches lies in how they handle the training data.

In the non-bootstrapped RF method, the researchers used the same training dataset as the non-bootstrapped GLM, consisting of 80% of the camera trap locations. This allowed them to generate species distribution probability surfaces for each felid species.

On the other hand, the bootstrapped RF approach involved subsampling the entire camera trap dataset by randomly selecting 20% of the presence and absence locations. They then trained the RF with the subsampled dataset and created the species distribution probability surface. This process was repeated 100 times, each time replacing the data used to train the models, resulting in 100 different probability surfaces. Finally, the researchers obtained the final species distribution probability surfaces by averaging the 100 probability surfaces independently for each felid species.

Therefore, while the text does not explicitly mention a deep learning model, it discusses the use of machine learning techniques for species distribution modeling, focusing on GLMs and RF algorithms.
