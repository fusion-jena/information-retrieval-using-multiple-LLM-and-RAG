The text does not provide explicit information about the specific purpose or type of the deep learning model used in the system. However, based on the context, we can infer that the model might be related to wildfire risk assessment or prediction due to its association with the Fire Weather Index (FWI) and Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC) data layers. These indices are commonly used in forest fire management to estimate the risk level and potential behavior of fires. Additionally, the mention of vegetation suggests that the model may consider factors such as fuel availability and moisture content when making predictions. Nevertheless, without more detailed information, it cannot be definitively stated whether the model serves purposes like classification, segmentation, or object detection.
