The text does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, it mentions that the Adam optimizer was used with its default hyperparameters, such as betas=(0.9, 0.999), eps=1.0 Ã— 10^-8, and weight\_decay = 0. This suggests that no specific optimization method like grid search or random search was mentioned for tuning these hyperparameters.
