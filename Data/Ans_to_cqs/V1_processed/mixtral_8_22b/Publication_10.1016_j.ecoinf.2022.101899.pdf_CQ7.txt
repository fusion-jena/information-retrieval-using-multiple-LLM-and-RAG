The authors do not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to split their data into training, testing, and validation sets for their deep learning model. However, it is common practice in machine learning to use a random stratified sampling technique to ensure that each subset maintains similar class distributions as the original dataset. Additionally, typical ratios for splitting datasets include 70/30 or 80/20 for training and testing, respectively, while some practitioners may further divide the training set into separate training and validation subsets. Without explicit information regarding the authors' chosen method, these standard practices can serve as a helpful reference.
