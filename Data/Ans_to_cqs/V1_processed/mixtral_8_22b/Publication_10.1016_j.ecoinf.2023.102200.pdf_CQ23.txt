The given context does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of any particular deep learning model. However, some common practices used to improve the generalization performance of deep learning models include:

1. Using diverse datasets: Training deep learning models with diverse datasets can help them learn more robust features and perform better when applied to new or unseen data. This is because diverse datasets expose the model to various patterns, reducing overfitting and improving its ability to generalize.

2. Cross-validation: Cross-validation involves dividing the available data into multiple subsets, called folds, and then iteratively training the model on different combinations of these folds while testing it on the remaining fold. This technique helps assess the model's performance across different subsets of the data and provides insights into how well it might generalize to new data.

3. Stratified splitting: When dealing with imbalanced classes within a dataset, stratified sampling ensures that each class is proportionally represented during both the training and validation stages. By maintaining this balance, stratified splitting can prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class and improve its overall generalization capabilities.

While the given context does not explicitly mention these techniques, they are commonly employed to enhance the generalizability of deep learning models.
