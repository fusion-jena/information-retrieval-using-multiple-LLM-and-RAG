Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available from the given context to provide the exact data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be noted that the authors used a combination of surveyed and estimated richness information collected in South Korea along with multitemporal remote sensing data to develop their deep learning model. They also mentioned using a NVIDIA Titan X GPU for training the model. It would be beneficial to check the original research paper or contact the corresponding author(s) directly to obtain the specific data repository link.
