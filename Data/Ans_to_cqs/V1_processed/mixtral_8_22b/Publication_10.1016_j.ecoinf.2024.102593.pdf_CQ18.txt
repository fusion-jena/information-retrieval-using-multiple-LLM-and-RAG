The text does not provide explicit information about a specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions that multiple models were trained on the same dataset, and decisions were made based on manual reviews and performance metrics. This suggests that monitoring model performance might involve evaluating statistical comparisons between model predictions and known classes from a held-out part of the training dataset or an unrelated labeled dataset. Additionally, the text discusses using Embedding Visualization (EV) to assess and compare characteristics and suitability of trained models, which could potentially be used as another way to monitor model performance during training.
