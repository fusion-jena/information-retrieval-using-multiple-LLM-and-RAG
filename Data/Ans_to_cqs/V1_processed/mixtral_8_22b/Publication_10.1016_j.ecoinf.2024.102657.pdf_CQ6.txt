The text does not provide explicit information about specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning models (i.e., CNN and k-NN). However, it mentions that no additional preprocessing was applied to the spectrograms beyond creating the metadata.csv files required for training. This suggests that the primary preprocessing step involved converting bird songs into spectrogram images and generating corresponding metadata. The goal was to minimize preprocessing to demonstrate the effectiveness of human-machine teaming. Therefore, it can be inferred that common preprocessing techniques such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning might not have been employed in this particular case.
