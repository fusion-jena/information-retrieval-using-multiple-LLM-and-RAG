Based on the given references, there isn't a direct mention of specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, translation, and shearing. These techniques help increase the amount of training data available and improve model performance by introducing variations into the input data. It would be best to refer to the original research papers or contact the authors directly for more detailed information about the specific data augmentation techniques used in their study.
