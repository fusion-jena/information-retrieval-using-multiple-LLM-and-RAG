The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is audio signals. Specifically, the training sets consist of audio signals recorded during the OHASISBIO program, which includes 7 hours of audio signals recorded in March 2015 using a hydrophone deployed at a depth of 1000 meters. The sampling rate was 240 Hz. The goal of the deep learning pipeline is to classify these audio signals into different types of vocalizations produced by SEIO PBW and blue whales.
