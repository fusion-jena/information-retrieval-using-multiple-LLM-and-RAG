The text does not provide explicit details about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some indications that suggest certain practices were followed. For instance, the authors mention manually removing the testing set, implying that they had separate training and testing datasets. Additionally, during the training process, 10% of the data was used as a validation set to check for overfitting. These practices align with common methods used to improve the generalizability of machine learning models, such as using diverse datasets and employing techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting. Nevertheless, without more detailed information, it cannot be confirmed if these exact methods were employed.
