To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting is a technique where the dataset is divided into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes or labels in both sets. This ensures that the model learns from a representative sample of the entire dataset.

Oversampling involves increasing the number of instances in the minority class to balance it with the majority class. This can be done by duplicating existing samples or generating new synthetic samples using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). Oversampling helps prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.

Undersampling, on the other hand, reduces the number of instances in the majority class to match the size of the minority class. This can be achieved through random sampling or more sophisticated techniques like Tomek links or NearMiss. Undersampling helps reduce the impact of outliers and noise in the majority class.

Diverse data collection involves gathering data from various sources and ensuring that the dataset represents all possible scenarios. This can help improve the generalization ability of the model and reduce its susceptibility to overfitting.

These techniques can be combined or applied individually depending on the specific requirements of the problem at hand. It is essential to evaluate their effectiveness using appropriate performance metrics and validation strategies before deploying them in production.
