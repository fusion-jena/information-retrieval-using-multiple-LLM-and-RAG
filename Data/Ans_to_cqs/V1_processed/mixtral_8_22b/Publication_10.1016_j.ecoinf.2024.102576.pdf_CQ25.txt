The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in this context is primarily for image classification. More specifically, it is employed for land-cover classification and extraction of ecological information. The model used here is the U-Net model, a type of convolutional neural network (CNN), which performs classification through supervised learning. The model is trained using both training and validation data, and classification is then carried out based on these data. It is important to note that the availability of labeled data is crucial for the application of the U-Net model. In this case, the lack of an official land-cover map in North Korea necessitated the use of phenological characteristics to classify elements based on the most relevant classes.
