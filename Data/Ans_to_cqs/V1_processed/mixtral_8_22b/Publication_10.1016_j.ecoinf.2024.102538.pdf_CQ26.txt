To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques have been mentioned in the given context. One technique is stratified sampling, which involves selecting birds of different class sizes from the dataset. This method was applied to create smaller subsets of the BirdCLEF2018 dataset, namely BC-S (BirdCLEF-Small) and BC-L (BirdCLEF-Large), and a subset of the Lishui-Zhejiang Birdsdata, referred to as LS*. The datasets were then split into three exclusive groups: 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing.

Another technique used to mitigate data bias is incorporating diverse data sources. In this case, files from "BirdsOnly" were added to all bird audio recordings to enrich the datasets. Additionally, two random mutations were performed to achieve data diversity: a random spectrogram mixup and a random tanh distortion.

Data augmentation techniques were also utilized to tackle the problem of a long-tailed distribution of data for rare and endangered bird species. Separate random data augmentation methods were employed, including adding background noise and performing random clipping and splicing.

In summary, the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline include stratified sampling, incorporating diverse data sources, and employing various data augmentation techniques like random spectrogram mixup, random tanh distortion, adding background noise, and random clipping and splicing.
