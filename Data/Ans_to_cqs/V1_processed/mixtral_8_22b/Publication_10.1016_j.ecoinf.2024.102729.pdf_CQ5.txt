Based on the provided context, it appears there is no direct mention of specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the context focuses on various research papers related to water quality management, remote sensing, hydrology, and ecology. These studies use different data sources and techniques, including machine learning algorithms and Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC) analysis, but they do not explicitly discuss using well-known deep learning datasets like those mentioned in the query. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, I am unable to provide the requested information about the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline.
