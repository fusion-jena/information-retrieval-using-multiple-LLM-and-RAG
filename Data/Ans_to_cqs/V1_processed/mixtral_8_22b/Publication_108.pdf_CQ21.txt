After the model training, there are several postprocessing steps that can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the project. However, based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any postprocessing steps taken after the model training. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the specific postprocessing steps involved in this case.

However, some common postprocessing steps include generating saliency maps to visualize the areas of the input image that most influence the output predictions, calculating various metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, or area under the curve (AUC) to evaluate the performance of the model, and creating confusion matrices to compare predicted versus actual classifications. These steps help to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of the trained model and identify potential areas for improvement.
