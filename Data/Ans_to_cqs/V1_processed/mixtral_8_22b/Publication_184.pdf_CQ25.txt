The purpose of the deep learning model discussed here is object detection, specifically detecting fishes within images. This is evident from several points mentioned in the given context. Firstly, the mention of using bounding box data along with the class of the object during training suggests that the model is being trained for object detection. Secondly, the use of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model, which is a popular real-time object detection system, further supports this conclusion. Lastly, the reference to improving precision, recall, and mean average precision, all of which are common metrics for evaluating object detection models, provides additional confirmation.
