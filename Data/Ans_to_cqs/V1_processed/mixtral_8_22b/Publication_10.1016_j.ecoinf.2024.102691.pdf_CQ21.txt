Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available in the given context to determine the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training for the mentioned study. However, generally speaking, common postprocessing steps can include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., creating confusion matrices, and performing statistical analysis on the results. These steps help evaluate the model's performance and understand its strengths and weaknesses. Please refer to the original research paper or contact the authors for more detailed information about their specific postprocessing steps.
