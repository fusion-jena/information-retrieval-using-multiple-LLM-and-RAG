The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, some clues suggest potential strategies used in the study.

Firstly, the use of multiple evaluation metrics such as Overall Accuracy (OA) and Cohen's Kappa statistic indicates that the researchers aimed to assess the model's performance thoroughly. These metrics help evaluate the model's ability to classify both wildfire-affected and unaffected areas accurately, contributing to its overall reliability and applicability across different scenarios.

Secondly, the study mentions the incorporation of prior knowledge during the exploration of continuous parameters. Prior knowledge refers to any relevant information or insights gained before conducting the experiment, which could include diverse datasets or other factors influencing the model's generalizability. Although the text does not explicitly mention how this prior knowledge was incorporated, it suggests that the researchers considered various aspects to improve the model's adaptability to new situations.

Lastly, the study employs two prominent models - RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV - for hyperparameter optimization. Both methods contribute to enhancing the model's performance by searching through a wide range of hyperparameter combinations. By performing an extensive search over the hyperparameter space, these methods increase the likelihood of finding the optimal set of parameters, leading to better model generalization.

However, without more detailed information, it remains uncertain whether the study specifically employed diverse datasets, cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other common techniques to ensure the model's generalizability.
