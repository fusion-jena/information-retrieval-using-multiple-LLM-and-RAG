The paper mentions several datasets used in their deep learning pipeline. These include MS COCO [51], Places2 [52], Sport-1M [53], Visual Genome QA [54], ILSVRC 2010 [55], and PlantClef2015 dataset [6]. However, the specific details about these datasets such as the type of data they contain, their size, and other relevant information are not explicitly mentioned in the given text. Therefore, based on the provided context, it cannot be determined what kind of datasets these are (e.g., whether they are image datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet).
