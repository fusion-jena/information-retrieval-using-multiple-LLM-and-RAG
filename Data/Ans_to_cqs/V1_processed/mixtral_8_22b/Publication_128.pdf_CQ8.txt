The given context does not provide any explicit information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only provides details about the computational resources and environment used in the study, such as the operating system, CPU specifications, development environment, and tool packages used. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available based on the provided context.
