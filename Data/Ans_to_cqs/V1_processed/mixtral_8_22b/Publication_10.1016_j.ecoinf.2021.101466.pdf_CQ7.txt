The data was split into training and validation sets using an 80/20 ratio. This means that 80% of the 4000 images per category were used for training the EfficientNet model, while the remaining 20% were used for validation purposes. The splitting process is not explicitly stated to be random, but it can be assumed that the data was randomly divided to ensure fairness and prevent any bias towards certain types of images during training. No specific mention of a separate test set was made, suggesting that the validation set might have been used for both validating the model during training and testing its performance after training. However, without explicit information about the use of a separate test set, it cannot be definitively confirmed.
