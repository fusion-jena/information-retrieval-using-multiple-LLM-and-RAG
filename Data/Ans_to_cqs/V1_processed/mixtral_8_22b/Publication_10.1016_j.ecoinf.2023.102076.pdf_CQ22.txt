The performance of the deep learning model was evaluated using several metrics, including precision (also known as specificity), recall (also known as sensitivity), and F1 score. Precision measures the proportion of texts identified as relevant that were actually relevant, while recall measures the proportion of relevant texts correctly identified as relevant. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of recall and precision. These metrics are considered more informative than accuracy, which can be heavily influenced by the balance of classes in the testing data. The experiments were conducted for each of the three models (Naive Bayes, Neural Network, and BERT) and for each classification task, using both social media posts and longer web articles.
