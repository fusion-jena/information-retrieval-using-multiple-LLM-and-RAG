Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be taken to improve its performance. These may include image resizing, normalization, and data augmentation. In the given context, the authors utilized transfer learning by initializing an ImageNet pre-trained ResNet34 model. They also employed data augmentation techniques such as vertical flipping of images, limiting overexposure, disabling zooming augmentation, and reducing memory load on GPU. Additionally, they set the batch size to 300 images and trained the model with a learning rate of 10^-3 for ten epochs. However, it is important to note that not all these steps are necessary for every deep learning project; the specific preprocessing steps required will depend on the nature of the problem being addressed and the characteristics of the input data.
