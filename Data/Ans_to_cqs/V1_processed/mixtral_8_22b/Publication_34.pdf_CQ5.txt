Based on the given information, there isn't any explicit mention of specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in the deep learning pipeline. Instead, the text discusses the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for processing input data of large sizes, typically 2D or 3D arrays like images. Furthermore, the description focuses on the structure and implementation details of the CNN model rather than specifying the dataset(s) used for training or evaluation purposes. Therefore, without additional context, I cannot provide the exact datasets utilized in this particular deep learning pipeline.
