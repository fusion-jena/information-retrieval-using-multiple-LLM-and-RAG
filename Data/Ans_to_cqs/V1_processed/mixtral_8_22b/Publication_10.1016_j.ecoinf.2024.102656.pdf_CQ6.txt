The provided context does not directly address the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does mention some relevant aspects related to preparing data for modeling purposes. In the given context, the authors employ a 3:1 train-test split for the occurrence points to facilitate model training. Additionally, they generate 1000 random pseudo-absence points across the study area, which serve as a reference for areas unlikely to be inhabited by the target species. Although these steps do not cover all possible preprocessing techniques for deep learning models, they demonstrate essential practices for preparing datasets for machine learning tasks. It is important to note that preprocessing steps can vary depending on the nature of the dataset and the requirements of the specific deep learning model being trained. Common preprocessing techniques include normalizing numerical features, encoding categorical variables, handling missing values, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
