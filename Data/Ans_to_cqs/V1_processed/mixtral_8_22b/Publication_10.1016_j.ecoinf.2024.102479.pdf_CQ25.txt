Based on the given context, it appears that the purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated. However, we can infer from the table that the algorithms mentioned such as Random Forest, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines, Penalized Regression, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting, Artificial Neural Network, and K-Nearest Neighbors are commonly used for tasks like classification, regression, clustering, etc. Therefore, without specific information about the task at hand, it cannot be definitively said what the purpose of the deep learning model is.

However, considering the use of k-fold cross-validation for evaluating the performance of the models, it suggests that the goal might be to build a predictive model. Additionally, the mention of 'ground-based AGB estimates' indicates that the model could potentially be used for estimating above-ground biomass (AGB) based on certain input features. But again, without more specific details, this remains speculative.
