The information provided does not contain details about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide specific information regarding the method used for model serialization or platform selection. However, generally speaking, after training a deep learning model, it can be deployed through several methods such as model serialization, where the model is saved into a file format like.pkl or.h5, which can then be loaded onto any system for prediction purposes. For platform selection, depending upon the use case, one might choose cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, etc., or edge devices like Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano, etc. Again, without more specific information, I cannot give a detailed response to this query.
