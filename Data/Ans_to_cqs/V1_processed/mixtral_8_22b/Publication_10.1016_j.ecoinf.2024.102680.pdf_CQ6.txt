Before training a deep learning model like UODN, several preprocessing steps are performed on the initial images. These steps aim to improve the model's performance during training by enhancing its ability to represent the data. One common step involves resizing the images to meet the required size. Another important step is applying algorithms such as mosaic data augmentation. Data augmentation techniques help create new training samples from existing ones, which can lead to better generalization and improved robustness of the model. In summary, the main preprocessing steps involve image resizing and data augmentation, both of which contribute to a more uniform distribution of input data and enhanced representation capabilities of the model.
