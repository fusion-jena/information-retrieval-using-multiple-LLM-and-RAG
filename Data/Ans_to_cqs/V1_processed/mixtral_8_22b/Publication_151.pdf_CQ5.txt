The text does not provide information about specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it discusses the evaluation of DEPP (Deep Eukaryotic Phylogenetic Placement) on simulated data sets. These data sets consist of 200-taxon and 10,000-taxon data sets, which were used to test the ability to train the CNN model within reasonable times. The training finished in around 20 minutes for the 200-taxon data set and 260 minutes for the 10,000-taxon data set on a machine with one 2080Ti NVIDIA GPU and 8 CPU cores.
