The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is object detection. Specifically, the model is used to detect wildebeest within survey images. The model employs a version of the YOLO Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) with pretrained weights from the COCO dataset. The goal is to automate the counting process, potentially replacing the need for manual counts by experts.
