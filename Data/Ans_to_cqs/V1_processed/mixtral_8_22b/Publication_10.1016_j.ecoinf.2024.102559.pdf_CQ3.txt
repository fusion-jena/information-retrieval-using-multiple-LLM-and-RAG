The given context does not provide specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest within images or video frames. Semantic segmentation is the process of classifying each pixel in an image into a category, such as sky, road, or building. Instance segmentation combines object detection and semantic segmentation by identifying individual instances of objects within an image and assigning them a label. These techniques can be used to train deep learning models for various applications, including object detection, image recognition, and autonomous driving.
