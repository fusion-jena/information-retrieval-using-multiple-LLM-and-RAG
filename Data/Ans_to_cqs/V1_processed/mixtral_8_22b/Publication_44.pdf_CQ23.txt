The text does not provide explicit details about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some indicators suggesting potential strategies employed. For instance, the use of a modified ResNet-101 architecture and an Xception model as feature extractors implies the application of transfer learning, which leverages pretrained models to enhance the model's ability to generalize across various datasets. Additionally, the mention of using a diverse set of features such as extent, filled area, major axis length, minor axis length, perimeter, solidity, diameter, aspect ratio, rectangularity, compactness, circularity, narrow factor, per dia ratio, per length ratio, and per width ratio suggests that the model may have been trained on a diverse dataset. Lastly, the reference to saving the best performing model based on validation loss indicates the possible use of cross-validation techniques to evaluate the model's performance and prevent overfitting. Nevertheless, these assumptions should be confirmed through further investigation or additional context.
