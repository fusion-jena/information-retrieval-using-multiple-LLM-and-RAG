To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed. One common strategy is to use fixed random seeds during training to ensure reproducibility of results. This involves setting the same seed value before each run of the model, which ensures that the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers is generated each time. Another strategy is to perform multiple runs of the model with different random seeds and then aggregate the results. This can help to mitigate the effects of any single run being influenced by a particularly favorable or unfavorable initialization. Additionally, techniques such as dropout and batch normalization can also be used to introduce controlled randomness into the model, which can help prevent overfitting and improve generalization performance. Finally, it may also be useful to explore different architectures and hyperparameters to find the most robust configuration for handling randomness.
