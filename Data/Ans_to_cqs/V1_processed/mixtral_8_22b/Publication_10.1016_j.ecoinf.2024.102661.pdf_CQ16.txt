In the given context, it appears that the training process is determined by a fixed number of iterations rather than specific criteria such as a validation loss plateau. According to the information provided, the TPEBO-LSTM model undergoes a training process consisting of 10,000 iterations. During each iteration, the model records the chosen hyperparameter combinations, associated training times, and loss values. However, there is no mention of any stopping criterion based on the validation loss or other metrics. Therefore, it seems that the training process continues until all 10,000 iterations have been completed.
