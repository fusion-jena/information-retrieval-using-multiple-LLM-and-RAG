Unfortunately, there isn't enough context provided to determine the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it's common practice to use Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) for such tasks due to their ability to handle parallel computations efficiently. These types of hardware are often preferred over Central Processing Units (CPUs) because they can process large amounts of data simultaneously, making them ideal for machine learning applications like deep learning.
