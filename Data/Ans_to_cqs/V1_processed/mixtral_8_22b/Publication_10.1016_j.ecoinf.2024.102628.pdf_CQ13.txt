The text does not provide explicit details about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. It only mentions that the'mtry' hyperparameter was tuned using the caret package in R, while other hyperparameters were kept at their default values. Additionally, variations in the 'ntree' parameter were explored. However, these parameters are associated with the random forest algorithm, not the deep learning model. Therefore, it cannot be determined what hyperparameters were used in the deep learning model based on the given context.
