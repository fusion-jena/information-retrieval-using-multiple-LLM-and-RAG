The given context does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. However, it mentions several techniques applied during the training process, including flipping images and labels along the X or Y axis, exchanging between multiple image channels, randomly rotating images and labels by 90 degrees, and randomly adding noise to the images while keeping the labels unchanged. These techniques can be considered as part of data augmentation strategies rather than hyperparameter tuning. Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot determine the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
