The text does not provide specific details about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some general techniques mentioned in the literature to handle data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets based on certain criteria, ensuring each subset maintains the same distribution of classes as the original dataset. Oversampling increases the number of instances in minority classes, while undersampling reduces the number of instances in majority classes. Both techniques aim to balance the dataset and reduce bias towards any particular class.

Diverse data collection refers to gathering data from various sources and environments to ensure the model learns from a wide range of examples, reducing the risk of biased predictions due to limited exposure to certain types of data.

While these techniques are commonly employed to mitigate data bias, the effectiveness of each technique depends on the specific nature of the dataset and problem being addressed. It is essential to evaluate the impact of these techniques through rigorous experimentation and validation before incorporating them into the deep learning pipeline.
