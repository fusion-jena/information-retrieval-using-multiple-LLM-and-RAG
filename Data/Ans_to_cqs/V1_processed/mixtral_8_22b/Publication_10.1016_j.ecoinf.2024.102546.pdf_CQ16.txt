The primary hyperparameter settings for both YOLOX and YOLOv8 include a warm-up period followed by a cosine decay schedule for the learning rate. However, the specific details regarding the stopping criterion or convergence thresholds for determining when training is complete are not explicitly mentioned in this context. Typically, common practices involve monitoring the performance on a separate validation set during training and using various criteria such as early stopping based on validation loss plateaus, minimum validation loss, maximum validation accuracy, or a predefined number of epochs. Without additional information, it cannot be definitively stated what exact criteria were employed to decide when training was completed for these particular models.
