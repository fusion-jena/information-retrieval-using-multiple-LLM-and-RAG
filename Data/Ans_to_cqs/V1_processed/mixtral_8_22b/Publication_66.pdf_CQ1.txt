In the given context, the researchers utilize a combination of Global Positioning System (GPS) devices and Time-Depth Recorders (TDR) to collect raw data on the behavior of European shags, common guillemots, and razorbills. These devices allow them to track the location and movement patterns of these birds, as well as record their dives and other underwater activities. This data is then used to train deep neural networks to predict the diving behavior of these birds. It appears that the researchers do not rely on publicly available datasets or survey responses, but rather gather their own primary data through the deployment of specialized tracking equipment.
