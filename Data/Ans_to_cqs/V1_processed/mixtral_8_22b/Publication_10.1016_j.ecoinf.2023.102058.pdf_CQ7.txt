Based on the given context, it does not provide specific information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training such as train, test, and validation sets. However, generally speaking, there are several common ways to split the data for machine learning models including deep learning models. One popular way is to use a random sampling technique where the entire dataset is randomly divided into three parts: training set, testing set, and validation set. Typically, the training set consists of around 60-80% of the total data, while the remaining data is equally divided into testing and validation sets. Another commonly used criterion is stratified sampling, where the data is divided based on class labels or target variable values to ensure that each subset has approximately equal representation from each class. Additionally, some researchers also use cross-validation techniques like k-fold cross-validation to evaluate their models more robustly. It is important to note that the choice of splitting criteria depends on various factors such as the size of the dataset, the complexity of the model, and the nature of the task being performed. Therefore, it is recommended to choose the appropriate splitting strategy based on these considerations.
