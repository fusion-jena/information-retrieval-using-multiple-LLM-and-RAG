The context does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to use a random stratified split or time series split when dealing with temporal data like acoustic signals. The typical ratio for splitting the dataset is 70% for training, 20% for testing, and 10% for validation. This allows the model to learn from a majority of the data while also having separate subsets to evaluate its performance and prevent overfitting. It is important to note that the optimal split ratios can vary depending on the size and nature of the dataset.
