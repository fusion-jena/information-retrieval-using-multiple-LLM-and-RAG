The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific method or source for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, generally speaking, there are several ways to collect raw data for deep learning applications. Some common sources include online databases, publicly available datasets, sensor readings, satellite imagery, drone footage, IoT devices, social media platforms, and even manual surveys. It depends on the nature of the problem being addressed and the availability of relevant data.

The mentioned paper uses a dataset consisting of 113 data records but does not specify how these data records were collected. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot determine the exact method used for gathering raw data in this particular case.
