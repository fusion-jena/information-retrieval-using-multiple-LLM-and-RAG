The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is not explicitly stated as either classification, segmentation, or detection. However, given the information available, it can be inferred that the model is used for multi-layer classification. This is evident from the statement "Our study leverages ML for multi-layer classification to accurately identify areas affected by wildfires." Therefore, the main objective of the deep learning model is to classify different regions into those affected by wildfires and those unaffected.

Additionally, the study aims to optimize data structures for machine learning classification, focusing on selecting the most relevant predictors from Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery. This suggests that the input to the model consists of satellite images, and the output is a binary classification indicating whether each region is affected by wildfires or not. Furthermore, the evaluation metrics mentioned, such as overall accuracy (OA) and Cohen's Kappa statistic, support the conclusion that the model is designed for classification tasks.
