I apologize, but there isn't any specific mention of data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline in the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful response based on the available information.

However, generally speaking, some common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, polygon annotation, landmark annotation, image classification, and instance segmentation. Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest in images, while polygon annotation uses irregular shapes to outline objects. Landmark annotation involves placing dots or points on key features of objects, and image classification assigns labels to entire images. Instance segmentation combines object detection and semantic segmentation to identify individual objects and their boundaries within an image.
