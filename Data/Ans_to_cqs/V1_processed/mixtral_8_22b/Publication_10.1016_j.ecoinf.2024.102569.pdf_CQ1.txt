The authors do not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, they discuss two types of data - presence-absence (PA) data and presence-only (PO) data. PA data is typically collected through designed surveys, while PO data can be accessed from various online platforms like eBird, Pl@ntNet, iNaturalist, and Observation.org, which are available on the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). The paper also mentions that analyzing PO data from these sources requires special attention due to potential issues such as species identification errors and local over-aggregation of records. Therefore, it can be inferred that both survey-based collection methods and publicly available datasets are employed for gathering raw data in this study.
