Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning models mentioned. However, it can be inferred from the context that the authors have employed various deep learning techniques such as U-Net and DeepLabv3+ variants for semantic segmentation tasks related to vegetation species discrimination and mapping of Brazilian Savanna physiognomies. These methods typically involve convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with multiple layers, filters per kernel, and possibly a multilayer convolutional decoder. The training process may use data augmentation techniques like rotation, scaling, flipping, etc. Additionally, skip connections between encoder and decoder layers might be utilized to preserve low-level details required for precise prediction of object boundaries. While these details offer some insight into the general structure and components of the deep learning models used, they do not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters such as learning rates or optimizers. Therefore, without further context or additional resources, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the exact hyperparameters used in their deep learning models.
