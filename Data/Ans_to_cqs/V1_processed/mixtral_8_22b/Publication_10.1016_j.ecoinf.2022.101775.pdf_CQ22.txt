Based on the given context, it appears that the authors have not explicitly mentioned the specific performance metrics used to evaluate the deep learning model. However, they do mention that they computed performance metrics in the test set after training the algorithm. They also state that the performance of the models was statistically measured to select the best fit for the data. Unfortunately, without more information or direct reference to specific metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., it is impossible to definitively determine what metrics were used. Therefore, I cannot provide a precise answer based solely on the given context.
