Unfortunately, the given context does not explicitly mention any specific dataset such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions collecting images for each class and training with a batch size of 100 for 20,000 steps. It also discusses extracting feature vectors from these images using Google Cloud Dataflow. Therefore, we can infer that some custom image dataset was created and utilized for training the deep learning models discussed in the text.
