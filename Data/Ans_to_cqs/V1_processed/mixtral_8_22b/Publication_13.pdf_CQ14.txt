The text does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It mentions that the model uses an adversarial training procedure to optimize shared intermediate features to be invariant between two domains, which potentially improves its ability to generalize across different datasets. However, there is no mention of specific optimization techniques such as grid search or random search.
