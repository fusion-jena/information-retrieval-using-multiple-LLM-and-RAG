The context does not provide explicit details about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, it mentions that random search without filtering is inefficient, suggesting that some form of optimization or filtering might have been used instead. The paper also discusses the use of an AdaLAM-based module integrated with local spatial consistency, but this doesn't directly address the method of hyperparameter optimization. Unfortunately, based solely on the provided context, we cannot determine whether grid search, random search, or another method was employed for hyperparameter optimization.
