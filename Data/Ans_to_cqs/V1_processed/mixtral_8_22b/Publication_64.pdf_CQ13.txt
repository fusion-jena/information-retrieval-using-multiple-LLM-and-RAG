The text does not provide explicit information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or other optimization details. However, it does mention that the Adam optimizer was employed for training the model for 100 epochs on a GTX 1080 GPU. Additionally, the authors initialized the weights of their model with pretrained weights from the ImageNet dataset, which were obtained through the Lasagne Model Zoo.
