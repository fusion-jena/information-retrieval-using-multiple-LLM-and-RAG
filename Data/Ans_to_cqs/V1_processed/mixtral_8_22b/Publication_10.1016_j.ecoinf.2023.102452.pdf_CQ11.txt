Unfortunately, there is no information available regarding the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in the given context. It seems that the authors did not provide any specific links or references to the datasets they used in their studies. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact location of the dataset used in these studies. However, some general resources related to deep learning pipelines are mentioned in the context, such as Eureqa, which is a software tool developed by Nutonian for automated discovery of scientific equations from experimental data. Additionally, several other papers and articles are cited in the context, which may contain relevant information about the use of deep learning techniques in different fields, including hydrology, ecology, and environmental science.
