To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting is a method where the training set is divided into subsets or strata based on specific criteria such as class labels. Each subset is then split into training and validation sets, ensuring that each set maintains the same distribution of classes as the original dataset. This helps prevent any skew towards certain classes during model training.

Oversampling is another technique used to balance datasets by increasing the number of instances in minority classes. This can be done by duplicating existing samples or generating new synthetic ones using methods like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). Oversampling ensures that the model does not become biased towards majority classes due to their higher representation in the dataset.

Undersampling, conversely, involves reducing the size of majority classes to match those of minority classes. While this may lead to loss of information, it effectively balances the dataset and prevents overfitting on majority classes. Random undersampling and Tomek links are common undersampling techniques.

Diverse data collection aims to gather more representative data by including examples from various sources, demographics, or conditions. By doing so, models trained on these datasets will generalize better across different scenarios and reduce potential biases introduced through limited or homogeneous data.

In conclusion, addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline requires careful consideration of multiple strategies tailored to individual datasets and applications. Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection are all valuable tools in achieving balanced and unbiased datasets for improved model performance.
