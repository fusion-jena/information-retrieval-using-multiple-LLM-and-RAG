The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it mentions that the authors did not select the optimal settings for their data set and have not tested various settings on other data sets. This suggests that they may have avoided overfitting the model to their particular dataset, which could improve its generalizability. Additionally, the authors mention using a rule of thumb to select the default k (embedding size) and choosing the final model based on the optimal objective function value. These practices might contribute to the robustness and applicability of the model across different scenarios.
