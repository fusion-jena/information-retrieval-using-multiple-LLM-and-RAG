To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. One such measure was using diverse datasets for training and testing purposes. These datasets included images captured under various conditions, such as different illumination levels, acquisition geometries, and camera types. By incorporating these variations, the model could learn to adapt to new environments and maintain its performance even when applied to unseen data.

Cross-validation was another technique employed to enhance the model's robustness. Cross-validation involves dividing the available data into multiple subsets, where each subset serves as a validation set while the remaining subsets form the training set. This process is repeated until all subsets have been used as the validation set once. By doing so, the model's ability to generalize is evaluated more accurately, reducing the risk of overfitting.

Stratified splitting was also utilized during the creation of the training and validation sets. This method ensures that both sets contain representative samples from each class present in the original dataset. Consequently, the model can better capture the underlying patterns within the data, leading to improved overall performance and generalization capabilities.

Additionally, the study addressed the issue of data drift or domain drift by focusing on domain adaptation techniques. Domain adaptation aims to increase the transferability of models to datasets with similar statistical properties but different distributions. By employing these methods, the researchers aimed to create specific datasets tailored to their desired applications, thereby improving the model's performance and ensuring its generalizability across varying domains.
