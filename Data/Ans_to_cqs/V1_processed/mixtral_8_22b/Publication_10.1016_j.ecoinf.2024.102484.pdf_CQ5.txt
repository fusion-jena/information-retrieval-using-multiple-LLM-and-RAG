The information provided does not explicitly mention any specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it mentions several sources of data related to soil degradation studies. These include the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD), the Basic Soil Property Dataset of High-resolution China Soil Information Grids, and various natural and anthropogenic factors like elevation, slope, mean annual temperature, precipitation, population density, GDP density, and points of interest in residential areas and roads. The study also uses ArcGIS 10.8 for direct acquisition and reclassification of some data. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine the exact datasets used in a deep learning pipeline.
