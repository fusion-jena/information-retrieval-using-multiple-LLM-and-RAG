Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available from the given sources to determine which specific cloud platform or deployment environment was used for the deep learning models mentioned in the research papers. None of the cited works explicitly mention the use of platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform for their experiments. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the platform used to deploy the deep learning models.
