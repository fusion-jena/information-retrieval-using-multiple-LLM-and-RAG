Based on the given information, it is not explicitly stated what specific hyperparameters were used in the deep learning model. However, it does mention that a random hyperparameter search was conducted to determine the optimum model structure. This suggests that various hyperparameters such as learning rate, number of layers, hidden nodes per layer, etc., could have been explored during this process. The range of values tested includes one to four layers and from 20 hidden nodes to 1,000. Unfortunately, without more detailed information about the results of this search, we cannot provide a definitive list of the exact hyperparameters used in the final model.
