To evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, several metrics are used. In this case, the authors use training loss, training accuracy, validation loss, and validation accuracy. Training loss refers to the error made by the model during its training phase, while training accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of total predictions made during training. Similarly, validation loss indicates the error made by the model when validated against unseen data, and validation accuracy shows the percentage of accurate predictions made during validation.

In addition to these metrics, the authors also mention precision and recall. Precision is calculated as the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives, whereas recall is computed as the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the actual number of positives. However, it should be noted that the recall for the workflow overall is not known due to the large amount of data required for manual analysis.

Lastly, the authors discuss the concept of data quality, emphasizing the importance of relevant textual descriptions and labels accompanying images uploaded by Flickr users. High textual quality contributes to improved extraction of information and better integration of data from various sources.
