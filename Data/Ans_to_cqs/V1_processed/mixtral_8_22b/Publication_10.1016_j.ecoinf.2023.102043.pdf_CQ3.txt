In the given context, the data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly stated as either bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it is clear that the annotation process involves matching registers and domain expert knowledge using a web-based annotation tool. This tool allows animal scientists and farmers to label goat vocalizations based on the information provided by farm records and the output of a YAMNet-based goat vocalization detection algorithm. Additionally, cameras were placed in barns to record videos that could support the labeling process. Therefore, it appears that the annotation technique used here is more related to audio and video annotation rather than image-based annotation methods like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.
