Unfortunately, based on the given information, there is no direct mention or reference to any specific code repository link for a deep learning pipeline related to this topic. Therefore, it would not be possible to provide a precise answer without additional details or resources. However, some of the cited papers might have shared their codes publicly on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. It is recommended to check each paper individually to see if they have made their code available.

For instance, Maier, P.M., Keller, S., Hinz, S., 2021 published a study titled "Deep learning with wasi simulation data for estimating chlorophyll a concentration of inland water bodies" which could potentially contain relevant code. To find out whether they have shared their code, one can search for the authors' names or the article title on popular code hosting platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
