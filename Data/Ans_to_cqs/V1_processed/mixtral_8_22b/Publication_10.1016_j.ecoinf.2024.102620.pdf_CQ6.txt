Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be applied to improve its performance and efficiency. These may include:

1. Data Cleaning: Removing or correcting erroneous, missing, or irrelevant data from the dataset. This step ensures that the input data used for training is accurate and reliable.

2. Normalization/Standardization: Scaling numerical values to a common range or mean and standard deviation. This helps prevent features with larger scales from dominating the learning process and improves convergence during optimization. Common methods include Min-Max scaling, z-score normalization, and log transformation.

3. Feature Engineering: Creating new features from existing ones to better capture patterns in the data. This could involve combining multiple features, extracting statistical properties, or applying domain knowledge to create meaningful representations.

4. Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing the number of input variables or features to simplify the model and avoid overfitting. Techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), or t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) can be employed.

5. Splitting Dataset: Dividing the dataset into separate subsets for training, validation, and testing purposes. The training set is used to train the model, while the validation set is utilized to tune hyperparameters and evaluate the model's generalization ability. Finally, the test set provides an unbiased estimate of the model's performance on unseen data.
