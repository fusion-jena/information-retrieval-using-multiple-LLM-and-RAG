The main data format used in the deep learning pipeline for sound recognition is audio. However, it is often transformed into a different format before being fed into the network. Specifically, the sound amplitude is mapped onto a 2-D mel-scale spectrogram. This transformation allows the use of advanced image recognition techniques for automatic feature learning. Therefore, while the original input is audio, the actual data format used in the deep learning pipeline is a 2-D image representation of the audio signal.
