The provided context does not explicitly mention specific preprocessing steps for training a deep learning model like normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does describe some preprocessing steps used for extracting unigrams from Wikiloc posts. These steps include translation, tokenization, lemmatization, and removal of English stop words. While these steps may not directly apply to every deep learning task, they do provide examples of how raw data might be transformed prior to being fed into a machine learning algorithm.

Translation involves converting text from one language to another, which is necessary when dealing with multilingual datasets. Tokenization breaks down sentences into individual words or tokens, while lemmatization reduces inflected forms of a word to its base form. Stop word removal eliminates commonly occurring words that do not carry significant meaning, such as 'and', 'the', etc.

These preprocessing techniques help prepare the data for further analysis but are not exhaustive. Depending on the nature of the problem and the type of data, other preprocessing steps might also be required. For instance, missing value imputation, outlier detection, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables are common practices in many machine learning tasks.
