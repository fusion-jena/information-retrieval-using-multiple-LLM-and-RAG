The paper does not explicitly mention which specific datasets were used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the testing dataset consisted of 500 manually annotated images from the same transect. Additionally, the authors state that they generated training, validation, and testing datasets using manual annotations. Therefore, we can infer that the datasets used in this study were likely custom datasets created specifically for this research rather than commonly used benchmark datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
