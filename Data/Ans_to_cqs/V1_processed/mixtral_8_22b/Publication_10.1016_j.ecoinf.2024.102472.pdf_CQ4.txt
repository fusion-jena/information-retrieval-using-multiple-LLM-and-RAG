Unfortunately, there isn't any information about specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, scaling, etc., being applied in the given context related to the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding these particular techniques. However, the text does mention some aspects of machine learning models like gradient boosting iterations, artificial neural networks, and optimal predictor variable selection. It also discusses the use of Multi-Layer Perception Neural Networks (MLPNNs) employing backpropagation in this study.
