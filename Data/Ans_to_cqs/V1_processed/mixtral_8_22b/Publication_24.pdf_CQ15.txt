Based on the given context, it appears that the authors used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Deep Learning for classification purposes. However, there is no explicit mention of specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) in the provided text. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. It would require further information or access to the original research paper to confirm the exact optimization techniques employed.
