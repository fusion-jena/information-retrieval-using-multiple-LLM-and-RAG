Based on the given references, it appears that there isn't explicit mention of the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer some possible methods based on common practices in similar fields.

Deep learning pipelines often use various data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. These techniques help in labeling the dataset, which is crucial for training machine learning algorithms.

Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangles around objects in an image to identify their location. This technique is commonly used in object detection tasks. Instance segmentation goes one step further by outlining the exact shape of each object in addition to its location. Semantic segmentation, on the other hand, involves assigning a category to every pixel in an image.

Given that the paper discusses detecting and locating specific types of surface marine MMOs using supervised Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) approaches, it is likely that these methods have been employed. For example, bounding boxes could be used to locate vessels and oil platforms in remote optical imagery, while instance segmentation might be applied to distinguish between different types of MMOs.

However, without more specific details about the data annotation process used in the referenced papers, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer. Further reading of the cited works would be necessary to confirm the exact data annotation techniques used in their respective deep learning pipelines.
