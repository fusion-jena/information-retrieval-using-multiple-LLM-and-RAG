Based on the given context, it appears that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is aerial images of the Kruger National Park (KNP). These images are analyzed to perform Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) analysis, focusing on mapping woody cover. The study uses a supervised learning workflow, where training and validation points are collected from various vegetation types within the park boundaries. The GLCM texture metrics are employed as independent variables, while the dependent variable consists of the LC labels assigned to the training samples. It is unclear whether additional data formats like CSV files containing metadata or other relevant information are used in conjunction with the aerial imagery. However, based solely on the provided context, the main data format used in the deep learning pipeline is aerial images.
