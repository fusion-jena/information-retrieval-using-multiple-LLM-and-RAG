The given context does not provide explicit information regarding the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, based on general machine learning practices, some common postprocessing steps include evaluating the performance of the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or area under the ROC curve; creating confusion matrices to visualize the performance of the classifier; generating saliency maps to understand the importance of input features; and fine-tuning the model parameters if necessary. It should be noted that these steps may vary depending on the specific requirements and goals of the project.
