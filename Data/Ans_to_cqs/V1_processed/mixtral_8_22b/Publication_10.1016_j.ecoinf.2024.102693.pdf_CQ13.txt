The table titled 'General transfer training hyper-parameters for each basic model' provides the hyperparameters used in the deep learning models. These include ResNet-50, ViT-S/16, Volo-d1, and ViP-Small/7. The hyperparameters listed are Learning Rate, Minimum Learning Rate, Optimizer, Scheduler, Batch Size, Weight Decay, Input Size, and Epochs.

For instance, the Learning Rate for ResNet-50 is set to 1e-4, while it is 2e-3 for ViT-S/16, 1e-5 for Volo-d1, and also 1e-5 for ViP-Small/7. Similarly, the Optimizer for all these models is Adamw(0.9, 0.999), and the scheduler used is Cosine. The batch size for all models except ViP-Small/7 is 128, while it is 64 for ViP-Small/7. The weight decay for ResNet-50 is 5e-4, while it is 8e-6 for ViT-S/16, 4e-6 for Volo-d1, and 1e-8 for ViP-Small/7. All models use an input size of 224 x 224, and the epochs for all models are set to 210.
