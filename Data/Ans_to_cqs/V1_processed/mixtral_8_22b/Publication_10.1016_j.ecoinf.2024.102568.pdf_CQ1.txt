The sources of raw data used in the deep learning pipeline primarily involve various types of sensors. These sensors measure pollutant levels, temperature, and humidity over consecutive time intervals. For instance, low-cost air quality (LCAQ) sensors are employed to gather these environmental readings. Additionally, the study mentions the utilization of legal stations, although it does not provide explicit details about their role or function within the data collection process.

Furthermore, the research discusses the implementation of a database structure adhering to ISO 19156:2011 standards and the TAQE model. This database stores information pertaining to both air quality sensors and legal stations. It employs PostgreSQL with PostGIS extensions to manage geospatial data and Timescale extensions to efficiently handle time-series data generated from sensor measurements.

However, there is no mention of other data collection methods such as surveys or public datasets being used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it appears that the primary source of raw data for this particular application is derived from sensor measurements.
