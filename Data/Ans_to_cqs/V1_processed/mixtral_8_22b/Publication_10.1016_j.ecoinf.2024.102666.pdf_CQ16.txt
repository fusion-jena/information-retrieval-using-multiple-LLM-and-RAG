Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention any specific criteria used to determine when training is completed, such as a validation loss plateau or other metrics. However, the text discusses evaluating the accuracy of Atmospheric Correction (AC) algorithms using remote sensing reflectance from satellite images. This process involves comparing the estimated results with in situ measurements, which can be seen in Fig. 3.

In general, machine learning models often use criteria like reaching a minimum validation loss, maximum number of epochs, early stopping, etc., to decide when the model has been sufficiently trained. In this case, while the exact criteria for determining completion may not be mentioned, we can infer that the authors likely evaluated their models based on how closely they could reproduce the actual in situ measurements.
