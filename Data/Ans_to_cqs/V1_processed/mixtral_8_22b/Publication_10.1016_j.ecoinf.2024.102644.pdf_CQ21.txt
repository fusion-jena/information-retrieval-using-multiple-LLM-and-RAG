The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, based on general machine learning practices, some common postprocessing steps include calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., creating confusion matrices to visualize the performance of the classifier, generating saliency maps or heatmaps to understand the importance of different features, and using optimal decision thresholds for binary classification tasks. In this case, it appears that the authors have used an optimal decision threshold for dichotomous classification of suitable/unsuitable locations, but no further details regarding other postprocessing steps are mentioned.
