The table provides a list of components used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. These include sampling protocols such as perpendicular, oblique, and others; sunlight, artificial light, mixed light; 3D camera, calibrated camera, laser marker, optical flow; UTC time, decimal degrees, float meters; Camera EXIF data like aperture, ISO, shutter speed; image pixel resolution & magnitude; Image Field of View (dimensioned); by imaging platform/camera; image-camera-orientation*; image-platform; image-illumination; image-scale-reference; image-practical-constraints*; Image-level capture; image-datetime data; image-longitude; image-latitude; image-depth; image-meters-above-ground; image-acquisition-settings; image-pixel-per-millimeter; image-area-square-meter; image-curation-protocol; image-annotation-QAQC*; Ancillary data captured; Documentation references; image-documentation-capture*; image-documentation-processing*; Use of bait (type, quantity, position related to imagery, etc.); mapping: planned path execution along 2-3 spatial axes, stationary: fixed spatial position, survey: planned path execution along free path, exploration: unplanned path execution, experiment: observation of manipulated environment, sampling: ex-situ imaging of samples taken by other method; Camera orientation to subject; seafloor, water column, sea surface, atmosphere, laboratory; photo, video, scan; insitu, exsitu; singleDateTime / rangeOfDates; grayscale, rgb, multi-spectral, hyper-spectral; Text. The specific methods used will depend on the particular application and requirements of the deep learning pipeline.
