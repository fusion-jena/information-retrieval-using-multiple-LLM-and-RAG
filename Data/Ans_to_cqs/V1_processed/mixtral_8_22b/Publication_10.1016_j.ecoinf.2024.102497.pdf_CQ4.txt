The given context does not explicitly mention any specific data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotation, scaling, etc. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer to this query based on the information available. It is important to note that data augmentation techniques are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to increase the amount of training data by applying random transformations to existing data, thereby improving the generalization performance of the model. These techniques can include flipping, rotating, scaling, translating, shearing, zooming, and more. However, without explicit details about the deep learning pipeline used in the study, I am unable to confirm which specific data augmentation techniques were applied.
