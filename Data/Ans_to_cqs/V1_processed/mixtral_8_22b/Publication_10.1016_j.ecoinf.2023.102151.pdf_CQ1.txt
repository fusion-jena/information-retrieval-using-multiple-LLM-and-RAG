The text does not provide explicit details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that technicians gather detailed soil information from a particular site by conducting soil surveys. This suggests that one method for collecting raw data might be through soil surveys. Furthermore, the mention of utilizing existing remote sensing data and web-based APIs implies that other sources of raw data collection may include satellite imagery, drone footage, or publicly available datasets. Lastly, the reference to Crop-CASMA (Zhang et al., 2022) for US soil moisture data indicates that public datasets could also serve as a valuable resource for gathering raw data.
