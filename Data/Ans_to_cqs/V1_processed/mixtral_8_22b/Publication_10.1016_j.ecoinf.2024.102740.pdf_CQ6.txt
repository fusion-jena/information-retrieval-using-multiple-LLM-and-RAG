The given context does not provide specific details regarding the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, generally speaking, these preprocessing steps can be crucial for improving the performance of machine learning models including deep learning models. Normalization involves rescaling the input features so they have a mean of zero and standard deviation of one, while scaling refers to transforming the range of independent variables or predictors to a certain scale without distorting their differences or distances. Cleaning data may involve handling missing values, removing outliers, and correcting inconsistent data entries. These preprocessing steps help improve the accuracy and efficiency of the model during training.
