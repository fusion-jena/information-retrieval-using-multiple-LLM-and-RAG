The source code for the deep learning pipeline is available from <http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2562058>. This link points to Zenodo, which is a general-purpose open-access repository developed under the European OpenAIRE program and operated by CERN. It allows researchers to deposit research outputs like figures, datasets, media, papers, posters, presentations, and reports. Therefore, while the exact version control system used for the code repository is not specified, it can be assumed that the code is publicly accessible through Zenodo.
