A convolutional neural network (CNN) is used in the pipeline for landscape type classification. Several state-of-the-art CNN architectures such as VGG, Inception, and ResNet were fine-tuned and evaluated for their performance. Among them, the ResNet architecture, particularly ResNet50 and ResNet101, demonstrated superior performance compared to the others. These networks were trained until they converged within 500 epochs, with Inceptionv3 taking longer to converge than the rest. The selected model was then utilized to predict the types of landscapes in the case study area.
