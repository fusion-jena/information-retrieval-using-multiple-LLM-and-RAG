The text does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, it mentions that the hyperparameters can be adjusted to predict or compare water quality across different water bodies. Common methods for optimizing hyperparameters include grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and others. Without more specific details from the source material, we cannot definitively state which method was used in this case.
