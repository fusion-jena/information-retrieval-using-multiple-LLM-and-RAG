The text does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, or validation sets. However, it mentions that the Random Forest (RF) classifier was trained using 5000 training samples and 500 trees. It also states that acquiring large-scale training data is laborious and time-consuming, suggesting that careful consideration must be given when selecting the appropriate amount of data for each set. In general, common practices for splitting datasets include using a percentage of the dataset for training (e.g., 70%) and reserving the remaining portion for testing and validation purposes (e.g., 15% for testing and 15% for validation). These percentages may vary depending on factors such as the size of the dataset and the complexity of the problem being addressed.
