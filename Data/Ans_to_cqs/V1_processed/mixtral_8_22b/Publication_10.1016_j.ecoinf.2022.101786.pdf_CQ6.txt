The given context does not provide explicit information about any specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model. However, some common preprocessing techniques for image data include normalization, scaling, augmentation, and cleaning. Normalization involves transforming the pixel values into a standard range, such as [0, 1] or [-1, 1]. Scaling refers to changing the dimensions of the input images to fit the requirements of the model architecture. Augmentation includes applying various transformations like rotation, flipping, zooming, etc., to increase the diversity of the training data. Cleaning might involve removing irrelevant objects or artifacts from the images. In this particular scenario, we cannot confirm which, if any, of these methods were applied without additional details.
