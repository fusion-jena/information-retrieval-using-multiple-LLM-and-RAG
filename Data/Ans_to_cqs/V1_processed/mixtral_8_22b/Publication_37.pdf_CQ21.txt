Based on the given context, it is not explicitly mentioned what specific postprocessing steps are involved after the model training. However, common practices in machine learning include calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., creating confusion matrices to visualize the performance of the classifier, and generating saliency maps to understand which parts of the input data contribute most to the predictions made by the model. These steps can help evaluate the performance of the trained models and provide insights into their decision-making process. It should be noted that these postprocessing steps may vary depending on the specific application and requirements of the project.
