The deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context uses audio data. Specifically, it utilizes large acoustic datasets analyzed by Kaleidoscope Pro 5.4.7, an automated signal recognition software. This software extracts sounds of interest based on certain parameters such as minimum and maximum signal length, minimum and maximum frequency range, and maximum intersyllable gap. The goal of this pipeline is to identify bird and frog species in tropical soundscape recordings. Therefore, the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is audio data.
