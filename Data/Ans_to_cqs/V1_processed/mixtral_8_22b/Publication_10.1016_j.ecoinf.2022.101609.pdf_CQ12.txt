Unfortunately, based on the given information, it is not possible to determine what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline. The text mentions that a deep learning model was developed and evaluated, but it does not specify whether it is a convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), transformer, or another type of model. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this query.
