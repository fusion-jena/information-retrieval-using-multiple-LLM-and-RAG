The paper does not explicitly discuss strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it mentions two main approaches used in its experiments: randomly initializing the neural network (denoted as 'R') and initializing the neural network with pre-trained weights from another dataset (denoted as 'I'). These initialization methods can impact the overall performance of the deep learning models. Random initialization may introduce variability due to the stochastic nature of the process, while pre-training on another dataset might provide more consistent starting points for fine-tuning on specific tasks. Nonetheless, the paper does not delve into specific techniques to manage randomness within the deep learning pipeline.
