Based on the given context, it does not explicitly state the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions that the data was split into training and testing data using 5 K-fold cross-validations. This suggests that the model may use some form of performance metric on the validation sets to decide when training should stop. Additionally, the mention of experimentation with training-validation approaches implies that there might have been different methods tested to optimize the training process. Unfortunately, without further details, it cannot be definitively stated what exact criteria were used to determine when training is complete.
