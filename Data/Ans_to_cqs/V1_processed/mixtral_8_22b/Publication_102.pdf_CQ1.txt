The text does not provide explicit details about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of two datasets: one for SSLs and another for elephants. It can be inferred that these datasets could have been collected through various means such as surveys, sensors, or even public datasets.

For instance, the SSLs' dataset might have been gathered using sensors or surveys, considering they are often used to collect data related to spatial statistics. On the other hand, the elephants' dataset could potentially come from aerial imagery, which is suggested by its name, 'Aerial Elephant Dataset.' This dataset might have been sourced from publicly available aerial imagery databases or captured using drones or satellite imagery.

Nonetheless, without more specific information regarding the collection process of these datasets, it remains speculative to definitively state the exact methodologies employed for gathering raw data in this particular deep learning pipeline.
