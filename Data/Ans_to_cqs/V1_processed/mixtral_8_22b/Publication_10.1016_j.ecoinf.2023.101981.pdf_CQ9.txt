The given context does not provide specific information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It discusses various aspects such as the use of automated signal recognition software for detecting ungulates, the effectiveness of this method, and its limitations. It mentions studies related to different deer vocalizations and their recall rates, but it does not explicitly state where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in these studies can be found. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based solely on the given context.
