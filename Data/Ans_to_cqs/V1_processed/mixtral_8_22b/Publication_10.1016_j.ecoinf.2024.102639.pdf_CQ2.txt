The text does not provide specific information on the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that machine learning, including deep learning, has been applied in various fields such as image processing and neuroscience. This suggests that images could be one of the possible data formats used in this context. Additionally, the study discusses the use of machine learning for modeling and predicting animal movement, which might involve using different types of data like videos or sensor readings. Nevertheless, without explicit details about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, we cannot definitively state what formats were employed.
