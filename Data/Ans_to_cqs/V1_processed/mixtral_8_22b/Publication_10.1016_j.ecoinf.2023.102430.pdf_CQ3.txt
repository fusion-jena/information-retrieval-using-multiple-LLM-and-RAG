The given context does not provide information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based solely on the provided context. However, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and landmark annotation. These techniques help label the data and train the deep learning models effectively.
