While the given context does not directly mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, some relevant information can still be extracted from the text. The authors discuss the issue of imbalanced class recognition of animal species in camera-trap images, which could potentially be addressed by using techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets based on certain criteria, ensuring that each subset maintains the same distribution of classes as the original dataset. Oversampling increases the representation of minority classes by duplicating samples, while undersampling reduces the majority class size to balance the dataset. Diverse data collection aims to gather a wide range of examples representing various scenarios, conditions, and variations within the target classes.

Although these techniques are not explicitly mentioned in the context, they have been widely applied in deep learning pipelines to mitigate data biases and improve overall performance. It should be noted that the choice of technique depends on factors like dataset characteristics, computational resources, and desired outcomes.

In conclusion, while the given context does not provide explicit details about techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, commonly employed methods include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.
