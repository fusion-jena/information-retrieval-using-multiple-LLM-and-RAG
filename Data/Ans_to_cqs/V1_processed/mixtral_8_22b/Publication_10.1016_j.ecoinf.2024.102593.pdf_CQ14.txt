The provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization methods used for tuning the hyperparameters of the model. However, it discusses the application of active learning, which iteratively trains new models with additional labeled data selected from their predictions to reduce manual annotation efforts. This implies that the models might be retrained multiple times during the active learning process, potentially involving hyperparameter tuning. Common methods for hyperparameter optimization include grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and others. Without specific information about the optimization techniques employed in this case, one cannot definitively state which method was used.
