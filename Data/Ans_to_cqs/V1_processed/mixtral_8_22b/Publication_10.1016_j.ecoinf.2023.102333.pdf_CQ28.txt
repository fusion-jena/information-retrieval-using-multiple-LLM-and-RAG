The article does not explicitly mention which specific cloud-based platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it mentions the use of Google Earth Engine, which is a cloud-based platform developed by Google for processing geospatial data. Therefore, it can be inferred that the deep learning model might have been deployed on the Google Cloud Platform, considering the integration with Google Earth Engine. Nevertheless, without explicit confirmation from the authors or further information, this remains an assumption.
