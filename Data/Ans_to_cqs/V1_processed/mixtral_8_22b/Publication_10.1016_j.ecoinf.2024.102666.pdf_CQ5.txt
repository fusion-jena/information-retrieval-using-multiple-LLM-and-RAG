The given context does not provide information about specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions two types of data sources utilized in this study: satellite images and in-situ measured data.

For satellite images, the sensors mentioned are MSI and OLCI with various spectral bands like blue, green, red, vegetation red edge, and near-infrared. These sensors have different central wavelengths and resolutions.

As for in-situ measured data, several studies are referenced but no explicit dataset names are provided. These studies focus on atmospheric correction for HY-1C CZI images, classification of inland lake water quality levels based on Sentinel-2 images, measurement of cyanobacterial bloom magnitude using satellite remote sensing, validation of a high-resolution acoustic imaging sonar method, and estimation of the remote-sensing reflectance from above-surface measurements.

Therefore, while there isn't direct mention of popular machine learning datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, the research uses satellite image data and in-situ measured data for its analysis.
