Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information on the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were employed, specifically the AlexNet architecture, which was successful in image scene classification tasks. It also highlights that CNNs are useful in processing high-dimensional imagery and capturing intricate patterns, making them valuable in environmental studies. Despite this information, there is no explicit mention of the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
