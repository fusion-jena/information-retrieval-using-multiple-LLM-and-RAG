Based on the given context, the metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models such as Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), General Regression Neural Network (GRNN), and Support Vector Regression (SVR) is Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The paper discusses the use of Improved Feature Transfer Learning (IFTL) as a refinement approach to enhance the predictions made by these models. The authors validate the effectiveness of IFTL by analyzing the percentage reduction in RMSE, ranging from 10% to 23%, when compared to traditional ELM and FTL methods. Additionally, the paper mentions the execution time analysis of the approaches but does not provide specific details about other evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, or recall. Therefore, based on the given context, the primary metric used to assess the performance of the deep learning models is RMSE.
