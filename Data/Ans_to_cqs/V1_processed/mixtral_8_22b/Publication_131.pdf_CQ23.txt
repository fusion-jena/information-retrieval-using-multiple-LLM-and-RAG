To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken during the development process. Firstly, a diverse dataset consisting of five different types of anuran calls was utilized for training and testing purposes. This diversity in the dataset helped improve the robustness of the model by exposing it to various patterns and characteristics present in the sounds produced by different species of frogs.

Secondly, a balanced sampling approach was employed when selecting samples for the test set. Specifically, one audio sample along with its corresponding data augmentation samples from each type of anuran call was chosen for inclusion in the test set. By doing so, the distribution of samples across different classes remained consistent, which further contributed to enhancing the overall performance and reliability of the model.

Lastly, the dataset was split into two parts - 80% for training and 20% for testing. This strategy is commonly known as holdout validation or simply train/test split. It allows for assessing how well the trained model can perform on unseen data while also preventing potential issues related to overfitting. In this case, using a larger portion of the dataset for training enabled the model to learn more effectively from the available examples without being too heavily influenced by any specific instances within the dataset.

In summary, multiple steps were taken to promote the generalizability of the deep learning model, including utilizing a diverse dataset, employing balanced sampling techniques, and implementing a train/test split methodology. These measures collectively worked towards ensuring that the developed model could accurately recognize and classify various types of anuran calls even when presented with previously unseen data.
