The given context does not directly discuss any specific techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it mentions two software tools used for data pre-processing - ViewSpecPro and The Unscrambler. It also refers to various methods like Continuum Removal (CR), Random Forest (RF), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Successive Projections Algorithm (SPA), Weight Average Partial Least-Squares Regression (WAPLSR), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS). These methods might be used for different purposes in the preprocessing stage but their role in handling data bias is not explicitly mentioned here. Furthermore, the text highlights concerns about losing effective spectral information due to preprocessing operations, which could potentially lead to incomplete feature information. This suggests that careful consideration should be taken when choosing and applying preprocessing techniques to avoid introducing biases or losing important information.
