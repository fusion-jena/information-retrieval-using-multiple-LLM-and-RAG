Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide a direct link to the data repository of the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context. However, it can be noted that the authors might have used publicly available bird acoustic datasets for their experiments, such as those found in competitions like BirdCLEF or other open databases related to bird sounds. Without specific details about the paper or authors, it would be challenging to pinpoint the exact dataset they utilized. Therefore, further investigation or additional context is required to accurately determine the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline.
