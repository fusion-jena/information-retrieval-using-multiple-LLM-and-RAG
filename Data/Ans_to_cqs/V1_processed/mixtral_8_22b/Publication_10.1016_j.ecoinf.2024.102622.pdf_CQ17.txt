Regularization methods are techniques used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise along with underlying patterns, resulting in poor performance on unseen data. Two common regularization methods are Dropout and L2 Regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored or "dropped out" during training, which helps to make the model more robust and prevents it from relying too heavily on any single feature. This can be thought of as creating a large number of "thinned" networks within the original network, each of which is trained on a subset of the input features. During testing, all neurons are used but their outputs are scaled down by the dropout rate to maintain consistent output scales.

L2 Regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. This encourages smaller weights, making the model simpler and less likely to overfit. It can be seen as adding a constraint to the optimization problem, forcing the model to find solutions with smaller weights while still minimizing the error.

These regularization methods help improve the generalization ability of deep learning models, allowing them to perform better on new, unseen data. However, they should be used judiciously, as excessive regularization can lead to underfitting, where the model fails to capture important patterns in the data.
