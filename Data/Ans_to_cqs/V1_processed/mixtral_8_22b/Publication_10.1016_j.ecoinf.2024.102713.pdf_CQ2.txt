Based on the given information, it does not explicitly state what specific data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline. However, there are some clues about the types of data being handled by the system.

From Table 1, we can see that the data sources include Monitoring Network, Satellite Images, Weather, and Environment. This suggests that the data could be in various formats such as text, numerical data, or images. Specifically, satellite images would likely be in a format suitable for storing visual data like JPEG, PNG, TIFF, etc.

Additionally, the mention of an incremental ETL process indicates that the data might need to be transformed before being loaded into the system. This could involve converting between different file formats depending on the requirements of each stage in the pipeline.

However, without more detailed information about the specific components and stages of the deep learning pipeline, I cannot definitively determine the exact data formats used.
