The papers cited do not directly discuss techniques to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, some general techniques can be mentioned based on common practices in machine learning and data science. These include stratified splitting, which involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes or labels; oversampling, where minority class examples are duplicated to balance the dataset; undersampling, where majority class examples are removed to achieve balance; and diverse data collection, which aims to gather more representative samples from underrepresented groups or classes. It is important to note that these techniques should be chosen carefully depending on the specific characteristics and requirements of each dataset and application.
