The given context does not provide specific information about the data augmentation techniques used in any particular deep learning pipeline. However, some commonly used data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, zooming, shearing, and brightness adjustment. These techniques can be applied to images or other types of input data to increase the size and diversity of training datasets, thereby improving model generalization and reducing overfitting. The choice of data augmentation technique depends on the nature of the problem and the characteristics of the dataset. For example, flipping may be useful for object recognition tasks where orientation is irrelevant, while rotation might be more appropriate for recognizing objects with rotational symmetry. It is important to note that excessive use of data augmentation could lead to unrealistic distortion of the original data, which may negatively impact model performance. Therefore, careful consideration should be given when selecting and applying data augmentation techniques.
