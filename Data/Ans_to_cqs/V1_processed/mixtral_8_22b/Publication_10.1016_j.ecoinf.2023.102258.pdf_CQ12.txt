The text does not provide explicit information about the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it mentions that several systems use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). For instance, Liu\_Surrey, Du\_NERCSLIP, and Yang et al. (2021) employ Mel +PCEN features with CNN models. Additionally, You et al. (2023) utilize a CNN (ResNet) architecture. Other systems mentioned include CNN framewise, CNN + CRNN + Perceiver, and AST. Therefore, based on the given context, various types of deep learning models are employed, including CNN architectures.
