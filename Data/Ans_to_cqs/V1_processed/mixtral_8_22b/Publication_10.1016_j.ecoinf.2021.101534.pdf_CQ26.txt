While the provided context does not directly mention specific techniques to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, it discusses various methods to enhance and diversify the available data, which could potentially mitigate data bias. These methods include data augmentation techniques applied to audio data, such as changing the frequency, pitch, and volume of audio signals, shifting, rotating, and zooming in the time and/or frequency domains of spectrograms, and adding additional noise. Furthermore, the text mentions audio-specific augmentation techniques like noise mixing and random signal amplitude, as well as sound mixing with other target signals and/or reverberations. Although these techniques primarily aim to increase the variability of audio data and improve model performance, they might indirectly help address data bias by creating more diverse and representative datasets. However, it should be noted that the effectiveness of these techniques in addressing data bias would depend on their implementation and the nature of the underlying biases in the data.
