After training the model, the authors saved the refined parameters and a graph for downstream analysis. They tested the model using filtered images and unfiltered audio files. The testing process involved comparing BatNet with other three networks. However, the specific details about the deployment of the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection, are not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
