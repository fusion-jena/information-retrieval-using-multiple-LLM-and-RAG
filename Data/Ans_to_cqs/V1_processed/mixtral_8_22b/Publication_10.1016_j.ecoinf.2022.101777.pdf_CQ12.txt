The text does not provide information about the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it mentions that images were classified using the Random Forest (RF) method, which is a machine learning technique based on decision trees rather than a deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. Therefore, no specific deep learning model is mentioned in the given context.
