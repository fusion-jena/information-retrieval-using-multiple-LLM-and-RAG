Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to determine what specific dataset(s) were used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context. However, we do have some details about the models and methods used in the pipeline.

In summary, the pipeline involves extracting latent representations from an autoencoder model and then feeding these into an MLP for classification tasks. The MLP uses the Adam optimizer along with a learning rate scheduler that modifies the learning rate when the network hits a plateau during training. Various parameter configurations and regularization techniques such as weight decay, batch normalization, and dropout were explored throughout the training process. Both cross-entropy and focal loss functions were utilized for training the MLP.

Additionally, the MLP architecture comprises four fully connected layers with sizes 256, 128, 64, and 12, respectively. Each layer includes a linear layer followed by PRelu activation except for the third layer, which incorporates Batch Normalization. The input size for the MLP is 512, representing the learned features extracted from the diffusion model. The final layer contains 12 neurons corresponding to the number of distinct events being classified.

However, without explicit mention of any specific dataset(s) used in the pipeline, I cannot provide further details regarding the datasets involved.
