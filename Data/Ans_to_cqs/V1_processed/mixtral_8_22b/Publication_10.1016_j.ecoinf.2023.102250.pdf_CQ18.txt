Based on the given context, it appears that the authors used various evaluation metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Top-1 accuracy, Top-5 accuracy, Top-1 error, and Top-5 error to monitor the model performance during training. These metrics were calculated using specific formulas, which have been mentioned in the context. Additionally, the authors compared the Inception Score (IS) and Frechet Inception Distance (FID) values of the sampled generated spectrogram of different ACGAN models. They also presented figures showing the classification accuracy of different models in two experimental groups, with bars representing the Top-1 accuracy for each network group and lines representing the Top-5 accuracy. However, there isn't any explicit mention of a specific strategy or methodology employed to monitor the model performance during training beyond these evaluation methods.
