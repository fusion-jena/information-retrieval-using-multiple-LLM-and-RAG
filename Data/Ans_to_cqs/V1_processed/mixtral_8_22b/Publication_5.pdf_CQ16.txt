In this case, the training process was completed once the loss function reached its minimum value. This indicates that the model has learned from the training data as much as possible, given the current architecture and optimization algorithm. It should be noted that reaching the minimum value of the loss function does not necessarily mean that the model will perform well on unseen data, so it is important to also evaluate the model on a separate validation set during training to ensure that it generalizes well. Additionally, other stopping criteria such as early stopping based on validation loss can be used to prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.
