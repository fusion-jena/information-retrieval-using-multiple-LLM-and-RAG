The text does not provide specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. However, it mentions that the authors used different numbers of hidden layers and subsets of features when training their model, suggesting that these were among the hyperparameters explored during the development process. It also notes that the best performing model was selected based on its lowest cross-entropy loss across various configurations. Unfortunately, without more explicit details regarding the exact values chosen for each hyperparameter, it is impossible to give a precise response to this query.
