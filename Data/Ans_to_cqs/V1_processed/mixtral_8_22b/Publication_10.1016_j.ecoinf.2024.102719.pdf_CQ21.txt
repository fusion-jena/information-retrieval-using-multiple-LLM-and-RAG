After the model training, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the task or project. Some common postprocessing steps include:

1. Prediction: Once the model has been trained, it can be used to predict outcomes for new input data. This step involves applying the learned parameters of the model to the test dataset to generate predicted values.
2. Evaluation metrics: To assess the performance of a machine learning model, various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, etc., can be calculated based on the confusion matrix. These metrics provide insights into how well the model performs in terms of correctly classifying positive and negative instances.
3. Hyperparameter tuning: In order to improve the performance of the model, hyperparameters such as learning rate, regularization parameter, batch size, etc., can be adjusted through techniques like grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization.
4. Feature importance: For interpretable models, feature importances can be computed to understand which features contribute most significantly towards the final output. Techniques such as SHAP values, LIME, or permutation importance can be employed for this purpose.
5. Visualizations: Various visualizations such as saliency maps, heatmaps, decision boundaries, etc., can be created to gain further insight into the behavior of the model. These visualizations help in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the model and identifying areas where improvements can be made.

In the given context, the authors have not explicitly mentioned any postprocessing steps apart from calculating the average loss, average bias, and average variance for each model. However, these calculations could also be considered as part of the postprocessing stage since they evaluate the generalizability of the machine learning models to unseen datasets.
