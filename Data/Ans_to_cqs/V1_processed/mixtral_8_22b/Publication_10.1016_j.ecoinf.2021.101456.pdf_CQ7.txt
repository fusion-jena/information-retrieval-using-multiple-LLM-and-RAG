Based on the provided context, there isn't explicit information about how the dataset was divided into training, testing, or validation sets. However, typically in machine learning and deep learning applications, datasets are often split into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. This division helps evaluate the model's performance and generalizability accurately.

Training Set: This portion of the dataset is used to train the model, i.e., adjusting its parameters through backpropagation and optimization algorithms like gradient descent. It allows the model to learn patterns within the data.

Validation Set: During the training process, the validation set is employed to fine-tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. By evaluating the model's performance on the validation set after each iteration, one can determine when to stop training to ensure optimal results without memorizing the training data.

Testing Set: After completing the training phase, the final evaluation of the model occurs using the testing set. Since these data points haven't been seen before, they provide an accurate measure of the model's ability to generalize and perform well on new, unseen data.
