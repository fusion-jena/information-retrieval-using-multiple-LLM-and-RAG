Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to provide the exact code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be assumed that since SegFormer is mentioned as the chosen model for GVI learning, its implementation might have been adapted from the official SegFormer repository available on GitHub. Here is the link to the repository: <https://github.com/NVlabs/SegFormer>. Please note that this is only an assumption and the actual code repository link may vary depending on the specific implementation details of the deep learning pipeline used in the paper.
