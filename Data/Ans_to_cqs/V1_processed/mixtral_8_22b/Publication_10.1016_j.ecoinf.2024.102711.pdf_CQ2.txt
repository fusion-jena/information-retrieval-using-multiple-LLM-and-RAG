Based on the given context, there isn't specific information about the exact data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer some details based on the mentioned tools and their typical usage.

AutoGluon, an open-source AutoML library, is primarily designed for structured data. Structured data usually refers to data that has a well-defined structure or schema, such as data stored in tables with rows and columns, like those found in CSV files or SQL databases. Therefore, it can be assumed that the data used in the deep learning pipeline might include structured data formats like CSV.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), another tool mentioned in the context, are commonly used for generating images, videos, and other complex data types. This suggests that the deep learning pipeline could potentially involve image or video data formats. However, without explicit mention of GANs being used in this particular case, this remains speculative.

In conclusion, while the context does not provide direct information about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that structured data formats like CSV are likely used, considering the application of AutoGluon. There is also a possibility of using image or video data formats, given the potential application of GANs, although this is not confirmed by the provided context.
