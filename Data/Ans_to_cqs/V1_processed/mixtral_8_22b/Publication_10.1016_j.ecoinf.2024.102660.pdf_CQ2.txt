Based on the given context, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data. Specifically, the study uses Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) water images for detecting water sun glint. The images are preprocessed and resized to a dimension of 256 x 256 pixels before being fed into the deep neural network. Therefore, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data.
