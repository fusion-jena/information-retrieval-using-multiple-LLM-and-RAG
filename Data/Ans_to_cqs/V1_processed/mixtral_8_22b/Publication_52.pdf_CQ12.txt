The pipeline utilizes a multi-layered neural network model that employs the unsupervised GRELMA algorithm as a fundamental component. Each level's outputs serve as inputs for the subsequent level. Additionally, an autoencoder is incorporated, which is a form of artificial neural network utilized for unsupervised learning of efficient coding. Its purpose is to learn a representation for a dataset while maintaining the output layer's node count equal to the input layer's, with the goal of reconstructing its own inputs rather than forecasting target values. Furthermore, the text mentions Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which have gained popularity recently and demonstrated significant success in numerous computer vision tasks, especially in object recognition. However, it does not explicitly specify whether the mentioned multi-layered neural network or the autoencoder is a CNN. Therefore, without further information, we cannot definitively determine if the pipeline exclusively uses CNNs or incorporates other types of deep learning models like RNNs or Transformers.
