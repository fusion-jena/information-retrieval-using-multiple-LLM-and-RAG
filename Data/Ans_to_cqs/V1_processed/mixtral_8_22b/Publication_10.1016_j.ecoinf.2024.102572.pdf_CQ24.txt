The papers provided do not directly address the issue of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, some general strategies can be used to manage randomness in such scenarios. These include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using ensemble methods to average results over multiple runs, or employing techniques like cross-validation to ensure robustness against variations due to random initialization. Additionally, Bayesian approaches can also be applied to quantify uncertainty arising from randomness in the models.
