The text does not provide explicit information on the strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions that supervised learning requires validation of classifications using additional behavioral observations. This suggests that one possible approach could be cross-validation, where the dataset is split into a training set and a test set. The model is trained on the training set, and its performance is evaluated on the test set. This process can be repeated multiple times with different splits of the data to get a more robust estimate of the model's performance.
