The text does not explicitly state the method used for hyperparameter optimization of the Support Vector Regression (SVR) model. However, it mentions that the model was "hyperparameter-optimized" and provides the ranges for the exponential parameters C and ε as well as the parameter σ. Common methods for hyperparameter optimization include Grid Search, Random Search, Bayesian Optimization, and Gradient-based Optimization. Without further information, we cannot definitively determine which method was used for hyperparameter optimization in this case.
