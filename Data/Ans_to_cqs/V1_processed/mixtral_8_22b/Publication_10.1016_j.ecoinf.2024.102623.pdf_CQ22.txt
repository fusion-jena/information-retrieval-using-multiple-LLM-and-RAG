The evaluation of the deep learning model's performance is primarily based on two main metrics mentioned in the given context: Mean Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) and Mean Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC), also known as Mean Average Precision (MAP) and Mean Average Recall (MAR), respectively. These metrics are used to assess the model's ability to accurately classify or predict outcomes.

In Table C.8, the Mean AUPRC is presented for different datasets (AWT, CAN, NSW, NZ, SA, SWI) and various loss functions, including Cole et al.'s losses, SSDL loss, SLDS loss, Full loss, and Full Weighted Loss. This table highlights the best and second-best performing models based on their respective Mean AUPRC scores.

Additionally, Table B.4 presents the Mean AUROC performance of several alternative Machine Learning (ML) loss functions, such as Cross Entropy (CE), Focal CE, LDAM, DB loss, Entmax, and Full Weighted. Each loss function has its own hyperparameters, which can be adjusted to improve the model's performance. The results are averaged over 10 random seeds to ensure reliable comparisons between the methods.

Overall, these tables demonstrate how the chosen loss functions impact the model's performance across multiple datasets and provide insights into selecting the most suitable loss function for specific tasks.
