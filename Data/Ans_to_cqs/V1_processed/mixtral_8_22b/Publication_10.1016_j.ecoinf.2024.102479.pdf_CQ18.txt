During the training phase, Grid Search Cross Validation (GSCV) is employed to identify the most effective set of hyperparameters that can improve the model's performance. GSCV generates a series of models, each having different sets of hyperparameters. These models undergo systematic training and assessment through cross-validation. The ultimate goal is to select the best performing model based on its optimal hyperparameter combination. In this case, a 10-fold cross-validation design was adopted, where the dataset was divided into two parts - 70% for model training and 30% for testing purposes. This approach ensures sufficient data for training the model and provides an independent dataset for evaluating its performance.
