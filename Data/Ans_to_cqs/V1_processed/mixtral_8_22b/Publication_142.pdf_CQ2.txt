The deep learning pipeline primarily uses image data. Specifically, it employs the Inception model, which is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed for processing images. The network is initially trained on the ImageNet dataset, a large collection of labeled images, and then fine-tuned using PlantNet data. The PlantNet classification tool accepts one to five images of a plant and returns a list of likely species, along with classification scores and matching images retrieved from the database. Therefore, the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is image data.
