The given context does not provide any explicit information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. It only mentions that a machine learning algorithm was employed to select important video factors related to the number of views for each video. However, it does not specify which type of machine learning or deep learning algorithm was utilized, nor does it mention any details regarding its configuration or hyperparameters. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, I cannot determine what hyperparameters were used in the deep learning model.
