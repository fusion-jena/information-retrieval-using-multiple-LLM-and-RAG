Based on the given context, it appears there isn't any direct information about data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide some general insights into common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. These include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation.

Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects within images to identify them. This technique is commonly used in object detection tasks. Semantic segmentation involves labeling each pixel in an image according to its class, such as 'car', 'person', or 'building'. Instance segmentation is similar but also differentiates between individual instances of the same class. For example, if there were two cars in an image, they would be labeled separately.

These techniques help train machine learning models to recognize patterns and features in new, unseen data. They are crucial steps in developing accurate and reliable AI systems. However, without more specific context related to the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the query, it's not possible to determine exactly which of these techniques might have been used.
