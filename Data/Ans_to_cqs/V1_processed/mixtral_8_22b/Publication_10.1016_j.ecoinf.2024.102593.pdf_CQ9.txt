The given context does not provide explicit information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, based on common practices in research publications, one can look for links or references to datasets within the cited papers or their supplementary materials. Unfortunately, none of the mentioned sources directly indicate a specific data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, without additional context or further investigation into the referenced works, I cannot determine the exact location of the data repository for this particular deep learning pipeline.
