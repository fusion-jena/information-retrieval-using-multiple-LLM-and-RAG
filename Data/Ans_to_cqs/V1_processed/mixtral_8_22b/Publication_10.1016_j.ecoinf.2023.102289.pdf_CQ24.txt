Unfortunately, none of the given pieces of context directly address the specific strategies used to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing the impact of different random seed values. However, it is important to note that handling randomness is crucial in ensuring the reproducibility and reliability of results obtained from deep learning models. Some commonly employed strategies include setting fixed seeds for various libraries or functions, which ensures consistent initialization of weights and biases across multiple runs. Additionally, techniques like cross-validation and ensemble methods help mitigate the effects of randomness during training and evaluation phases.
