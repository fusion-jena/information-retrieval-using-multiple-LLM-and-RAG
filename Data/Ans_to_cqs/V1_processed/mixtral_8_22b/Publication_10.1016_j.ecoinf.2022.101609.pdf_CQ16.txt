The completion of training can be determined based on various criteria, including the observation of a validation loss plateau. In the given context, the training process continued until 20,000 epochs were reached. During this period, both the training loss and validation loss were monitored. The training loss gradually decreased as the number of epochs increased, indicating improved performance. However, the validation loss exhibited a distinct pattern. After initially dropping significantly around 2500 epochs, it remained relatively constant for the remainder of the training epochs. This suggests that the model may have reached its optimal performance level, as further training did not result in significant improvements in validation loss. Therefore, observing the behavior of validation loss over time can serve as one criterion for determining when training should be stopped.
