The given context does not provide explicit details about the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that further development of the training dataset should enhance generalization and model accuracy, particularly by prioritizing images of poorly sampled species with higher error rates. It also suggests exploring new ways of learning and data generation, such as using metric learning to learn similar features between a pair of images or employing generative adversarial networks to generate synthetic image data. These methods can potentially improve error rates for poorly sampled species and low accuracy caused by class imbalance. Nevertheless, without additional information, we cannot determine the exact data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
