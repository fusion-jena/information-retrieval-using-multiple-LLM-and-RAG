Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available in the provided context to determine what specific postprocessing steps are involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the preprocessing steps such as creating a training database, adding classes like 'part of fish', 'fish', and 'random/specific background'. It also discusses using deep learning techniques for classification tasks, specifically mentioning the use of neural networks and their components. However, no details about postprocessing steps or methods used for evaluating the performance of the trained models are mentioned. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based solely on the given context.
