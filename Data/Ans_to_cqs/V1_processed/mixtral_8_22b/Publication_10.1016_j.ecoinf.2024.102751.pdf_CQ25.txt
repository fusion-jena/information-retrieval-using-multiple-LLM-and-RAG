Based on the given context, the purpose of using deep learning models such as machine learning or deep neural networks is not explicitly stated. However, considering the overall theme of the text, we can infer that these models could potentially be used for regression tasks to estimate soil moisture levels on reclaimed spoil heaps. The authors suggest testing these advanced methods of data analysis in the future to increase the accuracy of predictions. Therefore, while the specific type of deep learning task (classification, segmentation, detection, etc.) isn't mentioned, it can be assumed that the goal is to improve the precision of soil moisture estimation.
