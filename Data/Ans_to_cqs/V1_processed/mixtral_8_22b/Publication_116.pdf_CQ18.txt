The text does not provide explicit information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, considering the common practices in machine learning, some possible strategies include using validation sets, cross-validation techniques, or monitoring metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., throughout the training process.

The biased dataset section mentions splitting the dataset into 70% for training and 30% for testing, which suggests that the remaining 30% might have been used as a test set to evaluate the model after training. But again, no specific details regarding the monitoring strategy during training are mentioned.
