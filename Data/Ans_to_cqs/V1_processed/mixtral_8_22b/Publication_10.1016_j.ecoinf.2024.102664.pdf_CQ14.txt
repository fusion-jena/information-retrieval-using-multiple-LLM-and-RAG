The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a method that controls variables. This involves keeping other variables constant and selecting the parameters that optimize the validation data forecast results as the modelâ€™s hyperparameters. Specifically, the structure of all models, including hyperparameters such as kernel size and number of nodes, is determined using this method. However, the exact optimization technique used, whether it be grid search, random search, or another method, is not explicitly stated in the given context.
