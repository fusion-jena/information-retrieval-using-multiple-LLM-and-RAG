The text does not provide information about specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions two datasets related to valve gaping and temperature/chlorophyll levels collected using sensors deployed in the Venice Lagoon and the Wadden Sea. These datasets consist of daily curves of gaping for each sensor, resulting in 1286 daily curves for the Venice Lagoon and 203 daily curves for the Wadden Sea. The gaping data is expressed as a proportion of aperture, ranging from 0 (fully closed) to 1 (fully open), and recorded at 1Hz. The data was analyzed using R 4.0.5.

The datasets mentioned do not correspond to well-known computer vision datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, which are commonly used in deep learning pipelines for image classification tasks. Instead, they appear to be custom datasets collected specifically for studying valve gaping behavior in marine environments.
