I apologize, but based on the given context, there is no information about the use of any specific data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to your query. However, it appears that the study focuses on analyzing various types of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data derived from different sources like MOD13Q1 V6 NDVI dataset, CDR AVHRR NDVI dataset, and GIMMS NDVI dataset. These datasets are processed using the Google Earth Engine platform. Additionally, SPOT/VEGETATION products, administrative divisions, and DEM datasets are sourced from the Resource and Environmental Data Center. It seems that the main focus of the research is on methodology, visualization, conceptualization, software development, formal analysis, and writing related to these datasets rather than employing specific data annotation techniques in a deep learning pipeline.
