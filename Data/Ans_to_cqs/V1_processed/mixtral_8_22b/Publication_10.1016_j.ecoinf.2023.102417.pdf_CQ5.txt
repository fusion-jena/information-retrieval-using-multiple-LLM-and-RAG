The text mentions two main datasets used in the deep learning pipeline: ImageNet and a custom labeled dataset specific to the research. The ImageNet dataset is used for pretraining the encoder weights of the UNet model, achieving an accuracy of 78.57%. This pretraining is common practice in deep learning methods, particularly when working with smaller training datasets like the one used in this study. The custom labeled dataset consists of biocrust imagery, which is used to train the UNet model after it has been pretrained on ImageNet.
