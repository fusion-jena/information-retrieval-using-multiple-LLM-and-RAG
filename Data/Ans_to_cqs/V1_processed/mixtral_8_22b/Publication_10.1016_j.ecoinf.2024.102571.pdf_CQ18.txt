The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, it can be inferred from the information provided that the dataset was divided into three parts: 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for model testing. This suggests that the model performance was likely monitored using the validation set during training. Additionally, the high R^2 values indicate good fit between the observed and predicted GHG emissions, suggesting that the model performed well during both training and testing phases.
