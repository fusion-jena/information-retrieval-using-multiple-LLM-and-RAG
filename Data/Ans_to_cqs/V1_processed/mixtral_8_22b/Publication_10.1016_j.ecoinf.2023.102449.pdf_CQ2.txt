Based on the given context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily deals with audio data. Specifically, the pipeline employs Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) audio spectrograms. These are visual representations of sound frequencies over time, often used in bioacoustics research. Therefore, while the original input format might be raw audio files, they are transformed into spectrograms before being fed into the deep learning models. There is no mention of other data formats such as images, videos, or CSV files being used in the pipeline.
