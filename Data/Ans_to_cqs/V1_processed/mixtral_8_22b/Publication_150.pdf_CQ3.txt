The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does discuss various architectures of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), including ResNet-101, Wide-ResNet-101, InceptionV3, and MnasNet-A1, which have been employed for tasks like insect detection and identification. These architectures are typically used in conjunction with labeled datasets, where each image is assigned one or multiple labels corresponding to its content.

In general, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include:

1. Bounding Box Annotation: This technique involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest in images and assigning them appropriate labels. It is widely used for object detection tasks.

2. Semantic Segmentation: Here, every pixel in an image is assigned a label based on the object or region it belongs to. This technique is often utilized for scene understanding applications.

3. Instance Segmentation: Similar to semantic segmentation, instance segmentation also aims to classify every pixel in an image. However, it goes a step further by differentiating between instances of the same class. For example, if there are two dogs in an image, instance segmentation would distinguish between them, whereas semantic segmentation might group them together under the 'dog' category.

4. Polygon Annotation: This method involves outlining complex shapes using polygons instead of simple rectangles. It is particularly helpful when dealing with irregularly shaped objects.

5. Landmark Annotation: Also known as key point annotation, this technique involves marking specific points on objects of interest. It is frequently used in facial recognition systems and pose estimation tasks.

While the given context does not provide explicit details about the data annotation techniques used, it is reasonable to assume that one or more of these methods may have been employed during dataset creation for training the mentioned CNN architectures.
