The given context does not provide specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that various sources like surveys, sensors, or public datasets might have been employed based on common practices in machine learning applications. In general, these methods involve gathering relevant data related to the problem domain, which can then be processed and fed into the deep learning models for training and prediction purposes.

Unhelpful 
The context does not explicitly mention any methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. It primarily focuses on discussing different approaches for addressing sampling biases in ecological studies, including aggregation background methods and filtering methods. These techniques aim to improve the accuracy and reliability of species distribution modeling rather than specifying how the initial dataset was obtained.
