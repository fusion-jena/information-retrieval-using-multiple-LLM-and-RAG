The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the deep learning model was likely used for image classification. This is suggested by the mention of its application in separating empty images from those containing animals, identifying species, counting individuals, and categorizing animal behavior. Additionally, the model architecture used, ResNet50, is commonly employed for image classification tasks. Therefore, while not explicitly stated, it can be reasonably assumed that the primary purpose of this deep learning model was image classification.
