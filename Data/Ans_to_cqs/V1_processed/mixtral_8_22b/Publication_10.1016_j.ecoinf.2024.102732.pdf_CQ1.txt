The article does not provide explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the given context that remote sensing is one of the methods employed for gathering field data. This is evident through references to sources such as the USGS EarthExplorer website, which offers access to various satellite imagery datasets like Landsat and Sentinel-2. Additionally, the mention of using SRTM DEM data rendered at a resolution of 30 meters suggests the use of digital elevation models derived from radar or other remote sensing technologies. The paper also discusses the application of machine learning techniques, including random forests and neural networks, indicating that these methods may have been applied to process and analyze the collected data. Nevertheless, without further details regarding the study design or methodology, it cannot be definitively stated what exact methods were used for collecting raw data in this particular case.
