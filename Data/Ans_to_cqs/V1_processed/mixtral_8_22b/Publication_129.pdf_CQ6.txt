The context does not provide explicit information about specific preprocessing steps used before training a deep learning model. However, common preprocessing techniques include data normalization, scaling, cleaning, augmentation, and label encoding. Data normalization involves rescaling numeric columns to have a mean value of zero and a standard deviation of one. Scaling ensures that all features contribute equally to the final result. Cleaning removes noise and outliers from the dataset. Augmentation generates additional training samples by applying transformations like rotation, zooming, flipping, etc. Label encoding converts categorical variables into numerical values. These preprocessing steps help improve the performance and accuracy of deep learning models.
