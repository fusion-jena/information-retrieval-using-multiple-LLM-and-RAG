The given context does not provide information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training such as train, test, and validation sets. However, typically, the dataset is divided into these subsets based on certain criteria. The most common practice is to randomly divide the dataset into three parts: training set (used to train the model), validation set (used to fine-tune the model during training), and testing set (used to evaluate the final trained model). The division ratio may vary depending on the size of the dataset, but it is often around 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. Other criteria for splitting datasets include stratified sampling (to maintain class distribution) and temporal splitting (for time series data).
