The criteria used to determine when training is complete can be inferred from the given context. It appears that the model convergence was achieved early in the training session, but the loss continued to decrease throughout the specified epochs. This suggests that the training process was not stopped based solely on reaching a certain level of accuracy or loss. Instead, it seems that the training was completed after running for a fixed number of epochs, which in this case was 100. Additionally, the results show that increasing the number of epochs beyond this point would have resulted in minimal gains in accuracy and could potentially lead to overfitting. Therefore, it can be concluded that the completion of the specified number of epochs was used as the primary criterion for determining when training was complete.
