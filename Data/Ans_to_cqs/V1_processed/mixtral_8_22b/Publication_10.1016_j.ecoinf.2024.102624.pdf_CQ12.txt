The text does not explicitly mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, there are references to other studies that have used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for similar tasks such as Li et al. (2022) who evaluated decision fusions for classifying karst wetland vegetation using one-class and multi-class CNN models with high-resolution UAV images. Additionally, Liko et al. (2023) mentioned using deep learning-based training data augmentation combined with post-classification to improve the classification accuracy for dominant and scattered invasive forest tree species. But they did not specify the exact type of deep learning model used. Therefore, based on the given information, it cannot be determined what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline.
