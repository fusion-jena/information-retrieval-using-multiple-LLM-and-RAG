Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the optimizer. However, it can be inferred from the context that the deep learning method employed is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). CNNs typically use various hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, optimizers (like Adam, RMSprop, etc.), and regularization techniques (like dropout, weight decay, etc.). Since the exact values or choices of these hyperparameters are not mentioned in the context, it cannot be determined what they were for this particular study.
