The given context does not provide specific information about the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it mentions that researchers have made improvements in deep learning models for better fusion. It also cites a few studies where deep learning algorithms were applied, but none of them specify the exact type of deep learning model used. Therefore, without additional context or information, it is impossible to determine which type of deep learning model was employed in the pipeline.
