The text does not provide explicit information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, or number of layers. However, it mentions that the model was fine-tuned by unfreezing the entire model and training at a 10-fold lower learning rate (10^-4). This suggests that the initial learning rate might have been around 10^-3. Unfortunately, without additional details, I cannot provide a complete list of the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
