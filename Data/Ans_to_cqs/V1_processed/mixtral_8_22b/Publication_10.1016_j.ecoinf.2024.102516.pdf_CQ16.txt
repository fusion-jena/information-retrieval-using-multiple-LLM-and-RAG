The text does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, based on common machine learning practices, some possible criteria could include reaching a certain number of epochs or iterations, achieving a desired level of performance on a validation set, observing a plateau or decrease in validation loss, or meeting other user-defined stopping conditions. In this case, since the text mentions training a network with a mean scaled absolute error as regression loss, it might indicate that the training process continues until the validation loss reaches a satisfactory level or stops improving further. Nevertheless, without more detailed information, it would be speculative to definitively state the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete in this particular scenario.
