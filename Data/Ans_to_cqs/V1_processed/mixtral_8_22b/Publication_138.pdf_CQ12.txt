Based on the given information, the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This can be determined by examining the architecture of the network described in the text. Specifically, the presence of multiple convolution layers, pooling layers, and inception modules are indicative of a CNN. Additionally, the use of the ReLU activation function and the Softmax activation function in the final layer further supports this conclusion. Therefore, it can be confidently stated that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a CNN.
