In the given context, the purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is being used for prediction purposes. Specifically, the model is being used to predict Soil Organic Carbon Stock (SOCS) based on various environmental covariates such as topography, parent material, soil variables, climate, and biota variables. The deep learning algorithm employed for this task is the multilayer perceptron (MLP), which is a type of feedforward artificial neural network. The MLP consists of multiple layers including an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. The input layer receives the environmental covariates as features, the hidden layers extract relevant features, and the output layer provides the predicted values of SOCS. Therefore, the purpose of the deep learning model in this case is to accurately predict SOCS based on the given environmental factors.
