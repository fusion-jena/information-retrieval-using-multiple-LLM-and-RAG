The text does not provide explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the parameters of the deep learning networks are adjusted using annotated data, which is typically referred to as a supervised approach. This suggests that some form of manual or automated annotation was applied to the dataset before it was used to train the deep learning models. Common annotation techniques include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation, among others. Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangles around objects of interest within an image, while semantic segmentation requires pixel-level labeling of entire regions within an image. Instance segmentation combines both approaches, allowing for individual instances of objects to be identified and labeled separately. Without further details, it cannot be determined which specific annotation techniques were employed in this case.
