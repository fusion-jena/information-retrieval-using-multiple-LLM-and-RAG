After conducting initial computational experiments with different combinations of epochs of 300, 400, and 500 with batch sizes of 8, 16, and 32, it was determined that the optimal hyperparameters for their training were 400 epochs with a batch size of 8. However, the text does not provide information about other hyperparameters like learning rate or optimizer. Therefore, I do not have enough information to determine what specific values were used for these hyperparameters.
