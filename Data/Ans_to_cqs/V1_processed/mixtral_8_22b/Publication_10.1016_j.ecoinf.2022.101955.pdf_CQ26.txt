The authors do not explicitly mention any specific technique used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, they do state that they "equally centered and scaled the predictor variables" in order to reduce sampling bias. This suggests that some form of normalization was applied to the dataset before it was fed into the machine learning algorithms. Normalization is a common technique used to prevent certain features from dominating others due to differences in scales, which can lead to biased results. Other techniques mentioned in the query, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, are also commonly used to address data bias but are not specifically mentioned in this study.
