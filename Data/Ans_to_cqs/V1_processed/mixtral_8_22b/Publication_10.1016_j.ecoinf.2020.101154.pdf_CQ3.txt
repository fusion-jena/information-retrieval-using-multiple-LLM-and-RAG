The given context does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and landmark annotation. These techniques help label or tag the input data with relevant information, enabling the deep learning models to learn and identify patterns accurately.
