The paper titled "GPU-Based Training of Autoencoders for Bird Sound Data Processing" by Guo, J., Qian, K., Schuller, B., and Matsuoka, S. (2017) indicates that GPU resources were utilized for training their deep learning models. However, the other papers do not explicitly mention which specific hardware resources were employed for training their respective deep learning models. Therefore, while it is known that GPUs were used in one case, there is no information regarding whether TPUs or any other specialized hardware resources were also involved in these studies.
