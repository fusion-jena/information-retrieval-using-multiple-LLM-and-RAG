The text does not provide explicit information about specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it mentions that the Elastic Net is employed to improve the generalization ability of the ESK model and solve the overfitting problem when dealing with small datasets. This suggests that some form of regularization, possibly combined with weight decay, might be utilized within the deep learning pipeline. Additionally, the use of autoencoders implies that unsupervised feature learning could play a role in optimizing the overall performance of the model.
