The given context does not provide specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge, some commonly used data annotation techniques in deep learning include:

1. Bounding Box Annotation: This technique involves drawing a rectangle around the object of interest in an image. It is widely used in object detection tasks where multiple objects may appear in a single image.

2. Instance Segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image with a class label and an instance ID. It is useful for detecting individual instances of objects within an image.

3. Semantic Segmentation: This technique involves assigning a class label to every pixel in an image. It is often used for scene understanding tasks such as autonomous driving.

4. Polygon Annotation: This technique involves outlining the shape of an object using polygons. It is useful for irregularly shaped objects or when high precision is required.

5. Key Point Annotation: This technique involves marking specific points on an object, such as joints on a human body. It is often used for pose estimation tasks.

In the context of modern farming and precision agriculture, these techniques can be used for various applications such as crop health monitoring, yield prediction, and disease detection. For example, bounding box annotation can be used to identify diseased crops, while semantic segmentation can be used to estimate crop yields.
