Unfortunately, based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, typically, some commonly used criteria include reaching a certain number of epochs or iterations, achieving a desired level of accuracy or loss on the validation set, or observing a plateau in the validation loss. In this case, since the context mentions techniques like data augmentation to prevent overfitting and improve model generalization, it can be inferred that the training process might have been monitored using metrics such as validation loss or accuracy to ensure optimal performance and prevent overfitting. Nonetheless, without more specific details regarding the training procedure, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
