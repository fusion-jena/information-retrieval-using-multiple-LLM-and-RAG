The given text does not provide explicit information about specific preprocessing steps used before training a deep learning model like Variational AutoEncoder (VAE). However, it mentions that during the generation of samples from the VAE model, there are several operations involved, including preprocessing. Preprocessing generally refers to preparing raw data into a suitable format for machine learning algorithms. Common preprocessing steps include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and augmentation. Normalization scales numeric columns to a range between 0 and 1, while standardization rescales data to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. Cleaning involves handling missing or inconsistent data points, and augmentation generates new data instances through transformations. Although these general preprocessing steps might apply to any deep learning model, the exact methods used would depend on the specific requirements and characteristics of the dataset being utilized.
