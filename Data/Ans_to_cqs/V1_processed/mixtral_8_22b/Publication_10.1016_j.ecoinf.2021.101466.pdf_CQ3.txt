The given context does not explicitly mention any specific data annotation techniques used in their deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that they might have used bounding box annotations since they discuss Intersection over Union (IoU), which is commonly used when working with bounding boxes. Additionally, they use the term 'object detector,' which often involves detecting objects within bounding boxes. Instance segmentation is not mentioned nor implied in the given context.
