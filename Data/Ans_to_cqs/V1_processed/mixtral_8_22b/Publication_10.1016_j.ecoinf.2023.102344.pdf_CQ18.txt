Based on the given context, it appears that the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves setting an initial learning rate of 1 x 10^-3, employing every-epoch shuffle technique, and utilizing the shortest sequence length. Additionally, the convergence of the training process was observed after 1000 epochs with Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (SGDM) as the optimization algorithm. However, there is no explicit mention of specific monitoring techniques such as validation accuracy or loss tracking, early stopping, or learning rate scheduling. Therefore, while some aspects of the training strategy are clear, further details regarding the specific methods used to monitor model performance during training may not be available based solely on this context.
