The deep learning model is built using the fast.ai framework. Fast.ai is a deep learning library which provides high-level components that can quickly and easily provide state-of-the-art results in standard deep learning domains, and provides researchers with low-level components that can be mixed and matched to build new approaches. It is designed around the principle of making deep learning easier to use and understand.

The fast.ai framework leverages existing knowledge, which is particularly useful when dealing with smaller datasets such as the one mentioned in the given context. Furthermore, it utilizes transfer learning, where a model pre-trained on broad datasets like ImageNet is used for specialized tasks with more limited data.

In summary, the deep learning model is built using the fast.ai framework, which is known for providing high-level components for quick and easy state-of-the-art results in standard deep learning domains.
