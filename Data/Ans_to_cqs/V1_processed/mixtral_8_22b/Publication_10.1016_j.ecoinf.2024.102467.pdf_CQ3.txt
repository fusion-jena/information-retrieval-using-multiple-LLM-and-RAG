In the given context, it is mentioned that specific format image annotation files were required for training the object detection algorithm experiments in this study. The AUDD provides annotation files in the MS-COCO format, which had to be converted into a usable text format for the ground truth bounding box annotation files. Therefore, one of the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline is bounding box annotation. Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangles around objects in images and labeling them accordingly. It is commonly used for object detection tasks where the goal is to identify the location and class of objects within an image.

However, the context does not provide any information about other data annotation techniques such as instance segmentation. Instance segmentation is another popular technique used in computer vision tasks, where the aim is to detect and delineate each distinct object of interest appearing in an image. Unlike semantic segmentation, which groups pixels belonging to the same class together, instance segmentation differentiates between individual instances of the same class.

Therefore, based on the given context, we can only confirm that bounding box annotation was used as a data annotation technique in the deep learning pipeline. Other techniques such as instance segmentation may have been used but cannot be confirmed without additional information.
