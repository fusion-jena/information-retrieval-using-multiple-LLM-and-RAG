The text does not provide explicit information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning models. However, it can be inferred that the Python application designed to train the CNN might also handle the deployment process since it interacts with the final user (biologist). Additionally, the mention of updating the trained CNNs on the physical nodes or their digital twins suggests some form of model serialization and platform selection. But without specific details, it cannot be definitively stated what exact process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning models.
