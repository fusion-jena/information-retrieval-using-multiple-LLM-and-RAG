Based on the provided context, it appears that the focus of the research is on estimating forest Above Ground Biomass (AGB) using various machine learning methods such as AdaBoost, Random Decision Forest (RF), Multilayer Neural Network (NET), and Bayesian Ridge Regression (Bayes). However, none of these sources explicitly mention any specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in their deep learning pipelines. Regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization are commonly used in deep learning to prevent overfitting, but without more information about the specific implementation details of the models used in this research, we cannot definitively state which regularization methods were employed.
