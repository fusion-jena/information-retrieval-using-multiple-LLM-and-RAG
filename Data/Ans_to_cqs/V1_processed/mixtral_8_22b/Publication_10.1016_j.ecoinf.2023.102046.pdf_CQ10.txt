The given context does not provide information about the specific code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide the exact link to the GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository containing the deep learning pipeline mentioned in this study. However, based on the context, it appears that some parts of the pipeline might be available in open source libraries such as HuggingFace and Keras. For instance, the authors mention using the HuggingFace implementation of Vision Transformer (ViT) and the Keras implementation of Inception-V3. These implementations could potentially be found within the respective repositories of those projects. Nevertheless, without further details regarding the custom components developed by the authors, it is impossible to determine if there exists a single repository containing the entire deep learning pipeline described in this work.
