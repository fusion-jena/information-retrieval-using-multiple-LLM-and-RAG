The given context does not provide information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model mentioned in the paper by Devlin et al. (2018). The authors discuss pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding but do not mention any details about the hardware resources used during this process. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which hardware resources were utilized for training the deep learning model based solely on the provided context.
