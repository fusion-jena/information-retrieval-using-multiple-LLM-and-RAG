The information provided does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this query based solely on the given context. However, common methods used for hyperparameter optimization include grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and gradient-based optimization. Without further details about the specific study or methodology employed, I cannot confirm which technique was utilized in this case.
