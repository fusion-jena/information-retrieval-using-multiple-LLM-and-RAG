The purpose of the deep learning model is for image classification. Specifically, it was designed to classify high-definition satellite images into two categories: "dam" or "not dam". This was done to aid in the first continental-scale assessment of the density, distribution, and historical trends of farm dams in Australia. The model was based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), specifically a ResNet34 model, which was initialized with weights from an ImageNet pre-trained model. The model was then fine-tuned using a subset of labeled images and later applied to the entire dataset. The final model achieved an accuracy of 94.8%, demonstrating its effectiveness for this specific task.
