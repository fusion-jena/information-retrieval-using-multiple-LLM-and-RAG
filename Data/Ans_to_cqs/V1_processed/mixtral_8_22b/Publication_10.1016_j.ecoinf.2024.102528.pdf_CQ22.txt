The performance of the deep learning model, BirdNET, is evaluated using the metrics of recall and precision. Recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions made out of all actual positive instances in the data. In this case, it refers to the ability of the model to correctly identify the presence of a particular bird species based on its vocalization. On the other hand, precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions made out of all predicted positive instances. It indicates how many of the detected bird species are actually correct.

In this study, the average recall was found to be 29.7% ± 3.9 SE, and the average precision was 80.9% ± 3.8 SE. Although the recall is relatively low, the precision is consistently high for most species, indicating reliable species detections for further analysis. The authors also mention that they used a fixed confidence threshold of 0.35 for all species, which is a good compromise between false positives and missed detections for preliminary analysis. However, they note that the relationships between the confidence thresholds and the precision and recall values are species-specific, so they used species-specific confidence thresholds to account for the precision-recall tradeoff.
