Unfortunately, the provided context does not contain specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. However, it mentions that tuning of the hyperparameters was performed on the training set for each split, which suggests that various hyperparameters might have been tested during this process. Common hyperparameters in deep learning include learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, optimizer type, and others. Without more detailed information, it would be impossible to provide exact values or types of hyperparameters used in the mentioned study.
