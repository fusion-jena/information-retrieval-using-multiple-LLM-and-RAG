Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer from the context that the data layers mentioned - FWI and FFMC - are likely in a raster or gridded format due to their spatial resolution of 1 x 1 km. These data layers could potentially be in formats like GeoTIFF or other similar geospatial file types. Additionally, the reference to the Austrian wildfire database suggests that some form of structured data, possibly in a tabular format like CSV, might be used. But without further details about the deep learning pipeline itself, it cannot be definitively stated what exact data formats are being utilized.
