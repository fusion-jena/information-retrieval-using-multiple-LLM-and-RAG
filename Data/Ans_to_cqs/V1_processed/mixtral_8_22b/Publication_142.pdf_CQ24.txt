The provided context does not directly address the handling of randomness in the deep learning pipeline, including the use of random seed values. However, it discusses the application of AI image classifiers to large datasets of social media imagery for generating new datasets of biodiversity observations. It highlights potential biases in these datasets and proposes a checklist of questions for researchers to consider when employing this approach.

To specifically address the query about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, common strategies include setting a fixed random seed value for reproducibility, using techniques like cross-validation to reduce variability due to random sampling, and applying ensemble methods to combine multiple models trained with different initializations. Additionally, hyperparameter tuning and regularization techniques can help mitigate overfitting caused by random fluctuations during training.
