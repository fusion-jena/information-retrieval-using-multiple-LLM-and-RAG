The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, based on the information provided, it appears that the model aims to learn neighborhood relationships between different elements of a system. This is done to improve the overall performance of the model. Additionally, the model seems to utilize a backpropagation algorithm, which is commonly used in supervised learning tasks such as classification or regression. Therefore, while the specific application of the model is not mentioned, it can be inferred that its purpose is likely related to improving the understanding and prediction of interactions within a complex system.
