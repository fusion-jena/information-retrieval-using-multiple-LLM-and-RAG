The article does not explicitly state the specific data format used in their deep learning pipeline. However, based on the given context, it appears that they use geospatial data, which could be in various formats such as shapefiles or GeoJSON. They also mention using socio-economic U.S. Census data, which might be in CSV or other tabular formats. Additionally, they refer to using a GIS platform, suggesting that spatial data formats like raster or vector files may have been utilized. Without further clarification from the authors, we cannot definitively determine the exact data formats employed in their deep learning pipeline.
