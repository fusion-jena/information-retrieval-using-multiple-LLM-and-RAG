Unfortunately, based on the provided context, it does not explicitly mention any specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it mentions that TensorFlow, an open-source framework developed by Google Brain Team, is employed for performing deep learning analyses within the Google Earth Engine (GEE). TensorFlow supports various optimization techniques like SGD, Adam, RMSprop, etc., but without further information, we cannot determine which specific technique is being utilized in this case.
