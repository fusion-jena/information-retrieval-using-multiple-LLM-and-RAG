Unfortunately, there isn't enough information provided about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. The given text focuses mainly on the hyperparameter tuning process using Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT) for different models like RI and RY. It discusses how the learning rates, maximum tree depths, and number of iterations were determined for these models. However, it does not provide any details regarding the deployment process such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based on the given context.
