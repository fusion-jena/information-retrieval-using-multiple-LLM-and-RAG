The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific purpose of a particular deep learning model. However, it does indicate that typical machine learning applications involve recognition and classification of visual images or acoustic recordings. For instance, one study uses machine learning for animal audio classification. Therefore, we can infer that the deep learning models mentioned in the context might have been used for tasks like image or sound classification. It should be noted that without more specific information about each model, we cannot definitively determine their exact purposes.
