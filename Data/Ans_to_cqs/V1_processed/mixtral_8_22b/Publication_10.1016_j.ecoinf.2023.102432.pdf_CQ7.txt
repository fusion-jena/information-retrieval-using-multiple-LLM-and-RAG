The text does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (train, test, validation). However, it mentions that the single pixel dataset was split into training and testing data using 5 K-fold cross-validation. In general, K-fold cross-validation involves splitting the dataset into 'K' folds, where each fold serves as the test set once while the remaining 'K - 1' folds serve as the training set. The process is repeated 'K' times, ensuring that every observation has been part of both the training and test sets exactly once. Therefore, based on this information, one might infer that the authors used a similar methodology to split their data for training and testing purposes.
