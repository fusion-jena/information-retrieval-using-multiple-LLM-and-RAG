The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a fully convolutional neural network (CNN). This is evident from the description of the network architecture, which mentions the use of 2D convolutions with 4x4 filters throughout the layers. Additionally, the presence of residual blocks, consisting of Conv-ReLU-Conv structures, further confirms the use of a CNN. Other components such as batch normalization, leaky ReLU activation functions, and transposed convolutional layers also support this conclusion. Therefore, it can be confidently stated that the deep learning model employed in the pipeline is a fully convolutional neural network (CNN).
