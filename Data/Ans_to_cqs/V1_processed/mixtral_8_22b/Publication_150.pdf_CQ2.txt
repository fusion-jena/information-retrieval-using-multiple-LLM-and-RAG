Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, since the paper discusses the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), it can be inferred that the input data is most likely images. CNNs are primarily used for processing grid-like topology data, such as images, making them suitable for tasks like object detection, segmentation, and recognition. Therefore, it can be assumed that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data.
