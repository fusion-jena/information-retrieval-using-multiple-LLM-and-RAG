The text does not provide information on the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, common preprocessing steps include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and augmentation. Normalization involves rescaling numeric columns to a standard scale, typically between zero and one. Scaling adjusts values measured on different scales to a common scale. Cleaning involves handling missing or inconsistent data by removing or imputing it. Augmentation generates additional training samples from existing ones through transformations such as rotation, zooming, flipping, etc. These techniques help improve the performance and generalizability of deep learning models.
