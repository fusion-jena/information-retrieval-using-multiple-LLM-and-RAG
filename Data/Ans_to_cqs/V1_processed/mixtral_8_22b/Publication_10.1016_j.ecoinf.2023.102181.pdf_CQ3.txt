The given context does not provide specific details about data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, based on general knowledge, there are several common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines:

1. Image Classification: This technique involves labeling images into categories or classes. For example, classifying images of animals into different species.

2. Object Detection: This technique involves identifying objects within an image and placing a bounding box around them. It helps in localizing multiple objects within an image and recognizing their respective classes.

3. Semantic Segmentation: This technique involves assigning labels to every pixel in an image. It helps in understanding the overall scene better and is often used in autonomous driving applications.

4. Instance Segmentation: This technique combines object detection and semantic segmentation. It involves detecting individual instances of objects and creating a mask for each identified object.

5. Key Point Detection: This technique involves identifying key points or landmarks on an object. It is commonly used in facial recognition systems.

These techniques help in building accurate and robust deep learning models by providing labeled datasets for training and testing purposes.
