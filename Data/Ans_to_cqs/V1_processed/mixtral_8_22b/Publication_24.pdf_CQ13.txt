Unfortunately, the given information does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the type of optimizer employed. It only mentions that the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) had a series of layers, each of which modified its input data with parameterized mathematical operations optimized to improve classification performance during training. To find out more about the exact hyperparameters used, it would be best to refer to the original research paper or contact the authors directly.
