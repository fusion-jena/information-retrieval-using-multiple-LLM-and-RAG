The article mentions two specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of their deep learning model for identifying invasive vegetation species from UAV images. These metrics are the F1 score and the Jaccard index. The F1 score is a measure of a test's accuracy that considers both the precision and recall of the test to compute the score. It is calculated using the formula: F1 = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall). In this case, the final trained network achieved an F1 score of 0.9034 on the test set. The Jaccard index, also known as Intersection over Union (IoU), measures similarity between finite sample sets, and it is defined as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of the sample sets. For this work, the network obtained a Jaccard index of 0.8287 on the test set.
