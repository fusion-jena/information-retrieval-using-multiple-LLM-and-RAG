The context does not provide explicit information about the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the data can be chosen between text/csv (comma-separated values) or application/json format, following the common MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) types guidelines. It also discusses the use of satellite images, but it doesn't explicitly mention their use in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, based on the given context, we can infer that the possible data formats used in the deep learning pipeline might include csv and json, while satellite images may potentially be used as well.
