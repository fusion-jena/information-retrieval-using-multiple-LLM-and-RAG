The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include horizontal flipping, 0.2 degrees counterclockwise shearing, and random zoom between 0 and 0.2. These techniques lead to input tensors of 224 x 244 pixels in RGB format. Additionally, the data was normalized to ImageNet mean values, and the pixel values were rescaled within the range of [0, 1].
