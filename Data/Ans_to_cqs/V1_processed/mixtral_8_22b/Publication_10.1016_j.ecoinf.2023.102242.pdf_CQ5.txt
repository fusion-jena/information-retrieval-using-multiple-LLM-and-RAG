Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention any specific dataset used in the deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it discusses the use of high-resolution remote sensing data, specifically from the Gaofen-1 (GF-1) satellite. These data include both 2-m panchromatic images and 8-m multispectral images, covering red, green, blue, and near-infrared bands.

Before using these datasets in the deep learning pipeline, they undergo various preprocessing steps like radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction, orthophoto correction, image registration, image fusion, and mosaic cropping. Additionally, the context mentions the importance of having representative and sufficient training samples for accurate classification models, while avoiding data redundancy by optimizing features.

In summary, although the context doesn't provide explicit details about popular deep learning datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, it highlights the utilization of high-resolution remote sensing data from the GF-1 satellite and emphasizes the significance of proper preprocessing and feature optimization for efficient and accurate deep learning applications.
