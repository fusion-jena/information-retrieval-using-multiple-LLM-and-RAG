Based on the given context, it is not explicitly mentioned which specific hardware resources were used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. However, it does mention that analyses were run using a 10-core central processing unit (CPU) strategy with AMD EPYC 7402 on the University of Lausanne HPC cluster. This suggests that CPU resources were utilized for the computations involved in the study. Without further information, we cannot definitively state whether GPUs or TPUs were also employed for training the deep learning model.
