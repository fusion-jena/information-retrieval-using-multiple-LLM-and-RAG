The text does not provide explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the study uses an active learning approach for iterative training and improvement of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. This suggests that the researchers might have employed some form of supervised learning, possibly involving labeled training data.

In general, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and polygon annotation. These techniques help create labeled datasets required for training machine learning algorithms like CNNs.

Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangles around objects within images to specify their location. Semantic segmentation entails labeling each pixel in an image with its corresponding object or region class. Instance segmentation is similar but differentiates between individual instances of the same class. Polygon annotation involves outlining complex shapes or boundaries within images.

While these techniques aren't explicitly mentioned in the given context, they represent typical methods used in deep learning pipelines for various applications, including image classification, object detection, and semantic understanding.
