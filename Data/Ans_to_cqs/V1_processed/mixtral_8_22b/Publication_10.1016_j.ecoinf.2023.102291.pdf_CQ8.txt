The information regarding the specific code repository where the deep learning pipeline is available is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, it does state that the algorithm scripts are available in Supporting Information B. This suggests that the code might be included within the supplementary materials accompanying the research paper or article. Unfortunately, without further details, I cannot provide a direct link to the code repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. It would be necessary to access the original source material or contact the authors directly for more precise information about the location of the code repository.
