The text does not explicitly mention the specific evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does provide some information about the model's performance. It mentions that the validation accuracy of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier model using features extracted from the ResNet-50 model was 96.4%, and the test accuracy was 97.4%. Additionally, it states that the two classes, natural and anthropogenic microhabitats, are well structured when visualized using the t-SNE algorithm. While these details do not directly address the query regarding the specific evaluation metrics, they suggest that accuracy might be one of the metrics used to measure the model's performance.
