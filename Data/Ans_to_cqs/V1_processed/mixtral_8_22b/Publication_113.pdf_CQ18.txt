The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves employing margin-based active learning. This approach was applied after the first 30,000 active queries, resulting in the classifier achieving 93.2% overall accuracy. This process confirms the effectiveness of the suggested pipeline. Additionally, the authors compared five different query selection strategies against a control of selecting samples at random. These strategies include model uncertainty criteria such as confidence, margin, entropy, and representative sampling for text classification using support vector machines. Detailed results are available in Table S3. However, it should be noted that the specific implementation details of how the model performance is monitored during training are not explicitly stated in the given context.
