The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific framework(s) used to build the deep learning model. However, based on common practices in the field, some possible frameworks could be TensorFlow or PyTorch, as they are widely used for building deep learning models like Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs). It should be noted that without explicit information from the source material, this remains speculative.
