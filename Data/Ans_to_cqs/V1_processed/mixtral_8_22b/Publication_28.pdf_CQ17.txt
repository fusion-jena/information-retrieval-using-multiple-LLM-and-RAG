The paper does not explicitly mention any specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, the use of variational autoencoders (VAEs) in the proposed PTDLEN-VAE model could potentially help mitigate overfitting due to their ability to learn more robust representations of data through the incorporation of stochasticity during training. Additionally, the use of efficient preprocessing techniques like histogram equalization and normalization may also contribute to reducing overfitting by improving the quality and consistency of the input data.
