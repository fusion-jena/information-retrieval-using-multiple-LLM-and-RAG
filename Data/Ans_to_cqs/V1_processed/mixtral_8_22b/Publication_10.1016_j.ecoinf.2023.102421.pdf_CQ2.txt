The text mentions that the training dataset includes 268 sample plots with 39 features in a tabulated format. This suggests that the data used in this deep learning pipeline is likely in a structured format, possibly a CSV file or similar. There is no mention of other data formats like images, audio, or video being used in the pipeline. Therefore, it can be inferred that the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is a tabulated format, such as a CSV file.
