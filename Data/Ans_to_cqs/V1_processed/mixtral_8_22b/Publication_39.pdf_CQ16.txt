Based on the given information, the model is trained for a specific number of epochs rather than using a criterion such as a validation loss plateau to determine when training is complete. Specifically, the SlowFast architecture is trained for 40 epochs, while other models are trained for 30 epochs. During the training process, the learning rate is adjusted according to predefined schedules. For example, in the case of the SlowFast architecture, the learning rate is decreased with a cosine strategy, whereas for other models, the learning rate is decreased every 10 epochs by multiplying it with a factor of 0.1. Additionally, warmup iterations are used for the learning rate during the first epoch, with a warmup factor of 1/1000.
