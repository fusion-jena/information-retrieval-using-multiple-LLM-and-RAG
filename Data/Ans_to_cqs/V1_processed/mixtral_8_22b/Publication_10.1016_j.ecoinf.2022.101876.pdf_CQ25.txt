The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is object detection. Specifically, it uses a Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN) to identify and classify objects within images captured by camera traps. The model first identifies regions containing objects and then assigns them to one of three classes: animal, human, or truck. Its primary goal is to assist with processing large volumes of camera trap images, thereby reducing the time-consuming burden of manual image review and labeling.
