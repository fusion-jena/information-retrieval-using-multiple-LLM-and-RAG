The given context does not provide a direct link to the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) as one of the sources used. While there isn't a specific link to the deep learning pipeline dataset, here is the link to the GBIF dataset mentioned in the context: <https://doi.org/10.15468/39omei>. This dataset might be related to the deep learning pipeline or could have been used during its development. Please note that this is an assumption based on the available context, and further clarification would require additional information about the deep learning pipeline.
