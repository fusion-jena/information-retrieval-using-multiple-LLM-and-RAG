The paper does not provide explicit information about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, based on the table presented, it appears that the authors evaluated the performance of their model across various partitions and values of parameter 'C'. This approach is similar to k-fold cross-validation, where the dataset is divided into 'k' subsets or folds, and the model is trained and tested on each fold iteratively. By doing so, the authors could assess the robustness and stability of their model across different subsets of the dataset. Additionally, they used multiple evaluation metrics such as False Positive Rate (FP), True Negative Rate (TNR), Precision, Recall, and F1 Score to evaluate the performance of their model comprehensively. These measures suggest that the authors took steps to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model.
