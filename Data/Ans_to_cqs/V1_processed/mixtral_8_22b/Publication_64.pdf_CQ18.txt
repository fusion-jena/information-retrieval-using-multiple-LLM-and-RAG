The text does not provide explicit details about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions using random ten crop testing with smaller data augmentation parameters than those used during training for the ResNet50 evaluation. This suggests that the authors may have employed cross-validation techniques such as k-fold validation or holdout methods to evaluate the model's performance during training. Additionally, they likely monitored metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or loss functions to gauge the model's effectiveness.
