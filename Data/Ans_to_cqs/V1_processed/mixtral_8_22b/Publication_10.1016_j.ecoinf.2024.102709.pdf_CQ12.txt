The text does not explicitly state what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline. However, it mentions that the models are based on YOLO (You Only Look Once), which is a real-time object detection system. YOLO uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect objects within images or video streams. Therefore, it can be inferred that the pipeline uses CNNs as its deep learning model.
