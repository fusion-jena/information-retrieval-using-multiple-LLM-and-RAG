The text does not provide explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the mention of 'LabelImg', we can infer that bounding box annotation was employed. LabelImg is a graphical image annotation tool written in Python, often used for labeling objects within images by drawing bounding boxes around them. The labeled files were then saved in PASCAL VOC format as.xml files, further supporting this assumption. Additionally, since the paper discusses object detection using Faster R-CNN, another reasonable assumption would be that instance segmentation might have been utilized as well. Instance segmentation involves identifying individual instances of objects and creating pixel-wise masks for each identified instance. Nevertheless, without more detailed information, it cannot be definitively stated whether instance segmentation was indeed part of the data annotation process.
