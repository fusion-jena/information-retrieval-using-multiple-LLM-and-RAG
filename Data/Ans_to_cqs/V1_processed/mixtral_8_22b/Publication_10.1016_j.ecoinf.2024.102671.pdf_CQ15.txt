The given context does not provide specific details about optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, some commonly used optimization techniques in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). These methods help minimize the loss function during training, allowing the model to learn from its mistakes and improve over time. Other popular optimization algorithms include Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp) and Adagrad. Each method has its own strengths and weaknesses, and choosing the right one depends on factors such as the complexity of the problem, available computational resources, and desired convergence speed.
