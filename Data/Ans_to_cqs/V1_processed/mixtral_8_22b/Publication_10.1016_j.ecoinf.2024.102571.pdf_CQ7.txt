The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it is mentioned that the data was divided into three sets: training, validation, and testing. Typically, these splits are made based on percentages or fixed numbers of samples. In this case, 70% of the data was used for training, while 15% each was allocated for validation and testing. This distribution is common practice in machine learning and helps ensure that the model can generalize well to unseen data.
