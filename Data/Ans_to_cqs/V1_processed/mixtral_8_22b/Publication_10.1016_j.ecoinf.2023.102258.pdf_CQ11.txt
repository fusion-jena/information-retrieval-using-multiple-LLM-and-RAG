The given context does not provide any direct reference to a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions two potential sources for audio examples and annotations: Xeno-Canto and the Macaulay Library. These resources could potentially contain relevant datasets for developing deep learning pipelines in bioacoustics. Unfortunately, no explicit links to these repositories or their respective deep learning pipelines are mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot directly provide the requested data repository link.

To find the desired data repository link, one would need additional information about the specific deep learning pipeline being referred to. With this information, it may be possible to locate the corresponding dataset and associated code in a publicly accessible repository like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
