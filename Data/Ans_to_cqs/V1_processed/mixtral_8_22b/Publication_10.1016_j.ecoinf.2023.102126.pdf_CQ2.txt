The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that datasets can be of multiple file formats such as spreadsheets, videos, and audios. Therefore, we can infer that the deep learning pipeline might use various data formats like images, audio, video, and CSV depending on the nature of the problem being solved.
