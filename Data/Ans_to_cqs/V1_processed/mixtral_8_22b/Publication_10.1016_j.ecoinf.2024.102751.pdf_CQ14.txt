Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized using methods such as grid search or random search. However, it does mention that automatic elimination of variables with little impact on the modeled explanatory variable was chosen, indicating some form of feature selection process. Additionally, the'select = T' parameter suggests that smoothing parameter estimation during model fitting can completely remove the influence of a specific variable in the model. This implies that some sort of optimization technique might have been employed, but the exact method remains unclear from the provided text.
