To collect raw data for deep learning pipelines, various methods are employed depending on the specific application and requirements. In the field of ecology, one common method involves utilizing Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology connected to devices like Raspberry Pi. This setup enables researchers to gather large amounts of automatically labeled data, especially when studying bird populations. By attaching RFID tags to birds and installing RFID readers near nests, researchers can monitor parental visits and other behaviors without manual intervention.

Additionally, deep learning approaches have been successful in identifying and counting animal or plant species through image analysis. To create comprehensive training datasets, researchers photograph subjects under varying conditions, including different lighting intensities and shadows. This ensures that the trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can accurately classify objects despite changes in environmental factors.

Moreover, publicly available datasets can serve as valuable resources for gathering raw data. These datasets may contain information on diverse topics, ranging from wildlife behavior to climate patterns. Researchers can leverage these existing databases to supplement their own data collection efforts or even build entire projects around them.

Overall, the choice of method for collecting raw data depends largely on the nature of the project and its objectives. Combining multiple sources, such as sensor readings, survey results, and open datasets, can lead to more robust and accurate deep learning models.
