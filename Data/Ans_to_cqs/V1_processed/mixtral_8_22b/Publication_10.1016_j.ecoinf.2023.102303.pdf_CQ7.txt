Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into sets such as train, test, or validation. However, it can be assumed that common practices were followed. These typically include splitting the data randomly but proportionally into three subsets: training set, validation set, and testing set. The training set is used to fit the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the testing set is used to assess the final model's performance. The proportions often used are 70%, 15%, and 15% respectively, although these may vary depending on the size of the dataset and the requirements of the project.
