After the model training process, several postprocessing steps may be involved depending on the specific application and requirements. Some common postprocessing steps include:

1. Model evaluation: This involves calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., to evaluate the performance of the model. In the given context, the authors use top-k accuracy to measure the effectiveness of their technique. They calculate the top-k accuracy on a test set, where k=1, 5, and 10 represent the position of the correct match within a list of proposed matches.
2. Visualization tools: These help in understanding how the model arrived at its predictions. For example, saliency maps highlight the regions of an input image that contribute significantly to the output prediction. However, there is no mention of using visualization tools in the given context.
3. Overfitting prevention: The authors mention preventing overfitting during the training phase by monitoring the model outputs and error outcomes for signs of overfitting. They ensure that the model does not focus too much on data fitting, which can lead to memorizing the training set instead of learning a generalized matching strategy.
4. Data sharing: The authors provide instructions for researchers who wish to access the annotations and data used for machine learning training in this study. Requests should be made to the corresponding author, and permission must be granted explicitly by one of the authors or through an established collaboration on Whiskerbook.org.

Therefore, based on the given context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include evaluating the model using top-k accuracy, preventing overfitting, and providing instructions for data sharing.
