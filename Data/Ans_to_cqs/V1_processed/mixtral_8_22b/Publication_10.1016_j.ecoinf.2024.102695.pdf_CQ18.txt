The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is early stopping. Early stopping is a form of regularization used to avoid overfitting when training a learner with an iterative method, such as gradient descent. It works by monitoring the performance of the model on a validation set and stopping the training process once the performance starts to degrade. In this case, due to the early stopping strategy, the training process converges before the last epoch, preventing overfitting issues.
