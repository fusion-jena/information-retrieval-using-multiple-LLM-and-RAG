Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer some possibilities based on the mentioned applications and methodologies.

In the context, there is mention of using microphone arrays for recording sounds, suggesting that audio data might be part of the pipeline. This is further supported by the reference to "estimating the power contents of the sound signal." Additionally, the context mentions the application of machine learning and AI for "automated annotation and analysis," which often involves various types of data including images, videos, or text.

Moreover, the context discusses the use of AWS Kinesis and Apache Kibana, both of which support multiple data formats like JSON, XML, and CSV. These platforms provide real-time data streaming capabilities, making them suitable for handling large volumes of data generated during deep learning tasks.

However, without more specific details regarding the exact nature of the deep learning pipeline described in the context, it is difficult to definitively determine what data formats are being utilized.
