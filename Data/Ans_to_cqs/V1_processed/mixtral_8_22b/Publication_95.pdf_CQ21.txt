After the model training process, several postprocessing steps may be involved depending on the specific requirements of the project. However, based on the provided context, there isn't explicit information about the exact postprocessing steps used in this case. Nevertheless, some common postprocessing steps include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and creating confusion matrices to evaluate the performance of the model.

Saliency maps help identify which parts of the input image contribute most significantly to the final prediction made by the model. This can provide insights into how the model makes its decisions and whether it focuses on relevant features.

Calculating various evaluation metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score helps quantify the performance of the model. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions, while recall measures the proportion of true positives out of actual positives. The F1 score provides a single metric combining both precision and recall.

A confusion matrix is another useful tool for evaluating classification models. It summarizes the predicted and actual labels in a tabular format, allowing easy identification of false positives, false negatives, true positives, and true negatives. This can further aid in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the model.
