Based on the given context, it does not provide information about specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in the deep learning pipeline. Instead, the context discusses the use of Water Quality (WQ) indicator data, which is split into training and testing datasets using an 80% and 20% ratio, respectively. The dataset consists of 20 random sample locations for training and 10 random sample locations for testing. Therefore, I cannot provide the exact datasets used in the deep learning pipeline based on the given context.
