The paper does not provide information on the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions using a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is commonly used for processing grid-like topology data such as images or videos. The paper also discusses using spectral reflectance data, which could be stored in various formats like CSV or HDF5. Without further context, we cannot determine the exact data format used in this study.
