The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using several metrics such as Mean Intersection over Union (MIoU, %), Mean pixel accuracy (MPA, %), Accuracy (%), Precision (%), Recall (%), and F1 (%). These metrics help evaluate the performance of the model by comparing predicted values against actual values. MIoU measures the overlap between the predicted segmentation and ground truth, MPA calculates the proportion of correctly classified pixels, Accuracy determines the overall correctness of the prediction, Precision indicates the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions, Recall shows the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positives, and F1 combines both precision and recall into one metric. During training, these metrics can be used to track progress and adjust parameters accordingly.
