According to the given context, the hyperparameters of the model were not optimized using methods like grid search or random search due to processing limitations in Google Earth Engine (GEE). Instead, they utilized validation data for tuning the key hyperparameters for each model to prevent overfitting. The specific hyperparameters set for each model during training and validation are presented in Table 3. However, the exact methodology used for selecting these hyperparameters is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
