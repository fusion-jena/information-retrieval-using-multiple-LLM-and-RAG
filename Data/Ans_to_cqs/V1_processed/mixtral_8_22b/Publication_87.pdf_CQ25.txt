The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is not explicitly stated, however, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the model is being used for image classification. This is evident from the fact that the authors mention using the model for identifying animal species in large amounts of images. Additionally, they specify using metrics like accuracy and error rate which are commonly used for evaluating the performance of classification models. Furthermore, the authors state that they used a ResNet architecture, which is often employed for image recognition tasks. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model is primarily intended for classifying images into different categories, specifically for identifying various animal species in this scenario.
