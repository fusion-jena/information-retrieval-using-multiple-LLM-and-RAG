The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using two main metrics: precision and recall. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made by the model. Recall, on the other hand, measures the proportion of true positives out of all actual positives in the data. The number of iterations for which the CNN was trained has a significant influence on these metrics, with longer training generally resulting in higher recall but lower precision. The weights that offer the best compromise between precision and recall are selected to make predictions on the entire dataset.
