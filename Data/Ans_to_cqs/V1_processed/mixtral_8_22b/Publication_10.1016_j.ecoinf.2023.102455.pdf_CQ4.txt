Unfortunately, there isn't any information about specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, or scaling being applied in this deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that some form of data preprocessing or transformation has been done due to the mention of decomposing components and using them as inputs for the CNN-BiGRU model. This could potentially involve normalizing the input data, converting categorical variables into numerical ones, or other similar transformations. But without explicit details regarding data augmentation techniques, it cannot be confirmed if these were indeed implemented in the given pipeline.
