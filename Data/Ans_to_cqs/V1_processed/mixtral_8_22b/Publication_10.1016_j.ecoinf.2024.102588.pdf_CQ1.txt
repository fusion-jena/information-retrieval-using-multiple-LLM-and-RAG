The provided context does not explicitly mention specific methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. However, it does discuss various aspects of applying deep learning techniques to estimate aquatic ecosystem health indices. It mentions that the autoencoder generates new features from time series and static data related to the aquatic ecosystem. This suggests that the raw data could include temporal and spatial measurements collected through various means like remote sensing, satellite imagery, or ground-level sensor readings. Additionally, the context refers to ecological monitoring data being used to calculate indicators like TDI, BMI, and FAI, implying that field observations and sampling might also contribute to the dataset. Nevertheless, without explicit details about the data collection process, it remains uncertain what exact methods are employed for gathering raw data in this particular case.
