The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, some common methods used to improve the generalizability of deep learning models include using diverse datasets, cross-validation, and stratified splitting.

A diverse dataset helps expose the model to various scenarios, reducing overfitting and improving its ability to perform well on unseen data. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into multiple folds or sets, training the model on one set while validating it on another, and repeating this process until each fold has been used for both training and validation. This technique provides a more robust estimate of the model's performance on new data.

Stratified splitting ensures that the distribution of classes within the training and testing datasets remains consistent with the original dataset. This method prevents imbalanced class distributions during training and evaluation, which could negatively affect the model's performance.

While the given context does not provide explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, these are some commonly employed strategies to achieve this goal.
