To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. The given context does not explicitly mention stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling. However, it discusses avoiding bias generated by random data removal. One way to achieve this is through careful data partitioning, ensuring that the training, validation, and testing datasets maintain similar distributions.

The text also mentions keeping the data sets with the removed data for use with all methods. This approach could help mitigate potential biases introduced by discarding certain portions of the dataset. Additionally, the authors emphasize maintaining data assurance and quality while handling the growing volume of information from low-cost Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs).

Although not directly mentioned in the context, diverse data collection plays a crucial role in addressing data bias. Collecting data from various sources and under different conditions helps ensure that the model generalizes well across multiple scenarios.

In summary, based on the provided context, some techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing include careful data partitioning, preserving removed data for use with all methods, and focusing on data assurance and quality. While not explicitly stated, diverse data collection is another essential technique for minimizing data bias.
