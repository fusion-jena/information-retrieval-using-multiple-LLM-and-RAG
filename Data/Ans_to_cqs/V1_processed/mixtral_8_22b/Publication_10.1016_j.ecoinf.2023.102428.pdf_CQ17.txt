The given context does not provide information about the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline for this particular study. However, some common regularization techniques used in deep learning include dropout, L1 regularization, and L2 regularization. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent overfitting by making the network more robust. L1 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function equal to the absolute value of the weights, while L2 regularization adds a penalty term equal to the square of the weights. Both L1 and L2 regularization help prevent overfitting by discouraging large weight values. Other regularization techniques include early stopping, data augmentation, and batch normalization. It is important to note that the choice of regularization technique depends on the specific problem and dataset being studied.
