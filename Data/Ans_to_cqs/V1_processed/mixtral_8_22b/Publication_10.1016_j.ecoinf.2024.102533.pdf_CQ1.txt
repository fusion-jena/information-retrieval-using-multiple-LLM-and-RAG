The sources provided do not explicitly state the specific method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, they mention the use of certain tools and techniques which can be inferred as potential methods for data collection. For instance, Wang et al. (Sep. 2023) discuss the use of a portable spectrometer for rapid classification of the freshness grades of various types of fish and meat. Similarly, Moser et al. (Oct. 2023) evaluate spectral handheld devices for assessing the freshness of carp and trout fillets. These suggest that one possible method for gathering raw data could involve utilizing specialized equipment such as spectrometers or other similar devices. Additionally, Jayasundara et al. (Dec. 2023) focus on developing deep learning models for automated fish grading, indicating that their dataset might have been obtained through some form of image analysis or computer vision technique. Lastly, Ntzimani et al. (Jul. 2023) explore slurry ice as an alternative cooling medium for fish, implying that temperature readings or measurements may also play a role in data collection. In conclusion, while there isn't a direct reference to the exact method employed for acquiring raw data, it can be deduced that various approaches like spectroscopy, imagery, and temperature monitoring could potentially contribute to this process within the deep learning pipeline.
