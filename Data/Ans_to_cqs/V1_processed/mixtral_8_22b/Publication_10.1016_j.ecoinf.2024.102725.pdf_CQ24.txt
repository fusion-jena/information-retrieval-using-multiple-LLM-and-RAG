The provided context does not directly address the query about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide some general information regarding this topic.

Randomness in deep learning pipelines often arises due to factors such as initial weights, dropout layers, or shuffling of training data. To manage this randomness, several strategies can be employed:

1. Fixed Random Seeds: One common strategy is setting fixed random seeds for all operations involving randomness. This ensures reproducibility by generating the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers each time the code is run.

2. Multiple Runs: Another approach involves running the model multiple times with different random seeds and then averaging the results. This helps reduce variability caused by random initialization and improves overall performance.

3. Ensemble Methods: Ensemble methods combine predictions from multiple models trained with different random seeds. These techniques help improve the stability and reliability of the final output.

4. Deterministic Algorithms: Some algorithms, like deterministic versions of backpropagation, can also be used to eliminate sources of randomness in the training process.
