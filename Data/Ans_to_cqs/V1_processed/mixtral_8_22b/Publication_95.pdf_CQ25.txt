The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, based on the information provided, we can infer that the deep learning model is likely used for multi-class image classification. This is suggested by the mention of adapting the final classification layer to match seven classes, which includes six invasive alien plant species (IAPS) and one additional class labeled as "no species." Furthermore, the use of cross-entropy loss during training is commonly employed for multi-class classification tasks.
