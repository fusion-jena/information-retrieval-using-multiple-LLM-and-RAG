The text mentions that the samples were divided into training and validation datasets at a 7:3 ratio. This means that out of all the available samples, 70% were allocated for training the deep learning model, while the remaining 30% were reserved for validating its performance. This is a common practice in machine learning and deep learning applications, where the dataset is typically partitioned into three subsets: training set, validation set, and testing set. However, the specific proportions can vary depending on the size of the dataset and the requirements of the project. In this case, no explicit mention of a separate testing set was made, but it could have been included after the initial training and validation stages or combined with the validation set.
