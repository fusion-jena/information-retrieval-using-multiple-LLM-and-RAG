The text does not explicitly mention the use of a deep learning model; however, it discusses the application of machine learning methods for image classification purposes. Specifically, these methods are employed to automatically or supervise the classification process, potentially improving the efficiency and accuracy of land cover categorization. The authors suggest that incorporating human pattern recognition abilities with machine learning techniques, such as "human in the loop" classification, could further enhance the performance of these models. Additionally, utilizing multi-spectral imagery and indices like the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) may help improve the discrimination of various vegetation types. Therefore, based on the given context, the primary objective of employing machine learning methods appears to be automated or semi-automated image classification, particularly for distinguishing diverse vegetation categories.
