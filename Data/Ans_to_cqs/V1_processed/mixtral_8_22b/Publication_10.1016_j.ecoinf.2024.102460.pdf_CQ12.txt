The pipeline described in the given context uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, which is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The LSTM model is employed to address the prediction problem of time series data, specifically for land use change simulations in Lanzhou, China. It offers improved performance compared to traditional machine learning models, particularly when dealing with long-term dependency problems and multivariate time series data. The LSTM model replaces the Markov chain prediction model due to its superior ability to capture nonlinearity and long-term dependency relationships in time series data, thereby enhancing the prediction accuracy of land conversion.
