To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting is a technique where the dataset is divided into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes or labels in both sets. This ensures that the model learns from a representative sample of the entire dataset.

Oversampling is a technique used when there is a class imbalance in the dataset. It involves duplicating samples from the minority class to balance it with the majority class. This helps prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.

Undersampling is another technique used to handle class imbalance. Unlike oversampling, it involves removing samples from the majority class until it matches the size of the minority class. However, this may result in loss of valuable information.

Diverse data collection is a proactive approach to addressing data bias. It involves collecting data from various sources and demographics to ensure that the dataset is representative of the population. This helps prevent the model from being biased towards certain groups or features.

These techniques help mitigate data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, ensuring that the model is trained on a fair and representative dataset.
