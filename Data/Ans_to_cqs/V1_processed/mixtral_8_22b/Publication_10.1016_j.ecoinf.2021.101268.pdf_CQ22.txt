The metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models in this context is accuracy. Accuracy is calculated based on the number of correct predictions made by the model out of the total number of predictions. In this case, the accuracy is reported for both raw and pre-processed images across various stages including train, validation, and test. Additionally, Table 5 presents the accuracy of the models when swapping the testing sets between pre-processed and raw images.
