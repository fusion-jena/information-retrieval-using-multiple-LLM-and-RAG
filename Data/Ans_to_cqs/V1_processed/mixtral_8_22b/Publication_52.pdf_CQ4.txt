The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotation, or scaling. However, it discusses the application of Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs), a type of artificial neural networks, in big data analysis and bioacoustics. The paper also mentions the use of a multi-layered neural network model called Growing and Pruning Randomized Extreme Learning Machine Autoencoders (GRELMA) for clustering tasks. While these models may involve various preprocessing steps, including data augmentation, the exact techniques used are not specified in this particular context.
