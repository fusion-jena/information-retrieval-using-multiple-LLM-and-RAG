To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the use of diverse datasets can help improve the model's ability to recognize various types of sounds accurately. In this case, the model was trained on a dataset containing different sound classes from a wide range of species. This diversity helps prevent overfitting and improves the model's performance when applied to new or unseen data.

Secondly, data augmentation techniques were employed during the training process. These techniques included scaling, color space adjustments, and Mosaic augmentation. Data augmentation helps increase the variety of training examples available to the model without collecting additional data. By artificially creating new training instances through these methods, the model becomes more robust and better able to handle variations in real-world scenarios.

Thirdly, the model was trained for 100 epochs with a batch size of 32. Training for multiple epochs allows the model to iterate over the entire dataset numerous times, improving its understanding of the patterns within the data. A larger batch size enables the model to learn from more examples simultaneously, potentially leading to faster convergence and improved performance.

Lastly, the model was evaluated using test datasets to assess its accuracy and reliability. Although not explicitly mentioned in the given context, cross-validation or stratified splitting could have been employed during the testing phase to further validate the model's performance across different subsets of the data. However, based solely on the provided information, we cannot confirm whether these specific techniques were utilized.
