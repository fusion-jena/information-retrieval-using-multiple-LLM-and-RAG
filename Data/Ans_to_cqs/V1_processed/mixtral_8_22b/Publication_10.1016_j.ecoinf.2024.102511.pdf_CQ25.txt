The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in this context is primarily for classification tasks. The development of automated classification routines aims to improve efficiency, reduce subjectivity, and decrease costs when analyzing large datasets. BANTER is mentioned as an option for automated machine learning classification, indicating that it could be used for such purposes. Furthermore, advances in computing have enabled the increased use of machine learning for bioacoustic classification, particularly with deep neural networks. These networks have shown great potential for classifying large datasets across various taxa, including marine mammals. Therefore, based on the information provided, the primary goal of these deep learning models appears to be the classification of different species or categories within the dataset.
