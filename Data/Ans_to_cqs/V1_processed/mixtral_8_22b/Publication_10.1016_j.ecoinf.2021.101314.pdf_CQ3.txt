The given text does not provide specific information regarding the use of data annotation techniques in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer based solely on this context. However, generally speaking, some commonly used data annotation techniques in deep learning include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and labeling or tagging. These techniques help train machine learning models by providing labeled examples, which enable the model to learn patterns and relationships between input features and corresponding labels.
