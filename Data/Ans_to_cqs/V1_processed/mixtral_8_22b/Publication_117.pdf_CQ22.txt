The text does not explicitly mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the authors compare the accuracy of the methods by calculating the difference between the estimated counts produced by the deep learning model and the counts obtained through citizen science. They also compare these results to a count by a single experienced expert, which they consider the gold standard. Therefore, while not directly stated, it seems reasonable to assume that the authors might have used metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall to assess the performance of their deep learning model.
