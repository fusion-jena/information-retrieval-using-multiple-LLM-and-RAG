In the given context, there is no explicit mention of using datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the text discusses the use of the ADE20K dataset, which was developed by the MIT Torralba team and focuses on recognizing 150 indoor and outdoor objects. Specifically, 55 outdoor visual landscape elements from the ADE20K dataset were employed in this study. Additionally, the context mentions that models trained on the ADE20K dataset are particularly suitable for landscape-based applications.
