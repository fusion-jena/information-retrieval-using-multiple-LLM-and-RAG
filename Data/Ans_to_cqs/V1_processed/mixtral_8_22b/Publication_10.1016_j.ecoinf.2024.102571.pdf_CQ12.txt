The text does not provide explicit information about the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it mentions the use of a three-layer feedforward back-propagation neural network with a 30-20-10 architecture. This suggests that the authors have employed a form of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) rather than other types of deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers.
