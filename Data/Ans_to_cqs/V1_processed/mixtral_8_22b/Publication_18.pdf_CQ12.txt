The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the given context, which mentions that CNNs are a specialized type of neural network capable of extracting spatial patterns from images. Furthermore, the text discusses the use of CNNs in various applications such as image classification and object detection, both of which involve processing images. Additionally, the context refers to specific CNN architectures like Inception and Inception ResNet, further confirming the use of CNNs in this pipeline.
