The text does not provide information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it mentions that the architecture used was a heavily modified version of that used in "Unsupervised Deep Learning with Pytorch" by Github user "eelxpeng". Therefore, one might infer that the code could potentially be found in the same location or related repositories. Nevertheless, without further information, it cannot be definitively stated where the exact code repository is located.
