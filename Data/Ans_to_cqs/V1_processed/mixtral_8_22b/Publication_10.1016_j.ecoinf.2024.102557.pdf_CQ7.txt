The context does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into sets such as train, test, and validation. However, it mentions that the models were evaluated using environmental cross-validation with ten folds, which is a common method for splitting datasets. In this case, the dataset would be divided into ten equal parts, where nine parts are used for training and one part is used for testing. This process is repeated ten times so that each unique part serves as the test set once. This approach helps ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data and reduces overfitting. Additionally, the context discusses the use of Bayesian optimization to tune model hyperparameters, focusing on minimizing the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the predictions.
