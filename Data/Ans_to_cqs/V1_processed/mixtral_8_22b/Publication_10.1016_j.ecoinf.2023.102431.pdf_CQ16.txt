The context does not explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, based on common machine learning practices, one possible criterion could be monitoring the performance metrics such as validation loss or accuracy during the training phase. When the validation loss plateaus or stops improving significantly, it might indicate that the model has learned most of what it can learn from the training data, suggesting that training should be stopped to prevent overfitting. In this case, the table shows different sample sizes for training, validation, and test groups, indicating that there may have been a separate validation dataset used to monitor the model's performance during training. Without further information, we cannot definitively confirm if this specific approach was employed in this study.
