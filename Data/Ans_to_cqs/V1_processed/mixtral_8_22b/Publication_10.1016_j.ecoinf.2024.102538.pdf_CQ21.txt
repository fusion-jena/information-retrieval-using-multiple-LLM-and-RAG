After the model training, several postprocessing steps were mentioned or implied in the given context. These include:

1. Evaluation Metrics Calculation: The model's performance was assessed using various evaluation metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Accuracy (ACC), Hierarchical Distance of a Mistake (HDM), and Average Accuracy across all class hierarchies (avg\_ACC). These metrics help evaluate the model's ability to accurately predict bird species based on audio recordings.
2. Path Correction Strategy: The text mentions incorporating a path correction strategy into the model. However, it does not provide details about what this strategy entails. It is likely a method to refine or adjust the model's predictions based on certain criteria or rules.
3. Exclusion of Attention Mechanisms: Subsequent tests involved removing hierarchical attention ("w/o HA") and position attention ("w/o PA") mechanisms from the main block. This process helps understand the impact of these components on the overall performance of the model.

However, there is no explicit mention of other common postprocessing techniques like saliency maps or confusion matrices in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot confirm if they were part of the postprocessing steps for this particular model.
