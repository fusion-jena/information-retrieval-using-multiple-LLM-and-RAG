Based on the given context, it appears that the evaluation metrics used for the Random Forest (RF) model are not typical deep learning metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall. Instead, the performance of the RF model is evaluated using different measures.

For instance, the Variable Importance (VI) score is used to determine the significance of each input feature in predicting the output. A threshold of 30% VI is set, above which variables assume higher importance. This helps identify the most influential features in the dataset.

Additionally, the percentage of explained variance is used to assess how well the model explains the variability in the target variable. In this case, the intermediate models established by RF show that the proportion of explained variance is between 91% and 92%.

Furthermore, the correlation coefficient between the observed and predicted values is employed to gauge the strength and direction of the relationship between them. All samples exhibit correlation coefficients above 0.95, suggesting a strong positive association.

Lastly, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and R^2 are utilized during the 10-fold cross-validation process to quantify the difference between the actual and predicted values. Lower RMSE and higher R^2 indicate better model performance. On average, the RMSE is 141.124 ion/cm3, and the R^2 is 0.931, demonstrating the high simulation accuracy and good stability of the RF model.
