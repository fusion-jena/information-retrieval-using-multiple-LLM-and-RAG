The text does not provide explicit information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that satellite images were used for training and validation purposes. These images were divided into sub-images of size 256 x 256 and used to generate batches of size (m, 256, 256, 3), where m is the batch size. The corresponding batches of mask data had shape (20, 256, 256, 1). Additionally, the text refers to the use of ImageNet-2012 dataset for evaluating the performance of CNN design choices. Therefore, while the exact datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that satellite images and potentially ImageNet-2012 were utilized.
