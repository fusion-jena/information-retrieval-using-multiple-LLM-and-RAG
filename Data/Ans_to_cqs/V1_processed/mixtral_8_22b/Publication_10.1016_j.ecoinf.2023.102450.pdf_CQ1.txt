The context does not provide explicit information regarding the specific methods used for collecting raw data in this particular deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the CRediT authorship contribution statement that Zixuan Yin contributed to 'Data curation', which suggests that some form of data collection process took place. Additionally, the mention of 'Data will be made available on request' implies that there is indeed a dataset involved in this research. Unfortunately, without further details, it cannot be determined whether the data was collected through surveys, sensors, public datasets, or other means.
