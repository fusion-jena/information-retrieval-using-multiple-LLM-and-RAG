Based on the given context, it appears that the authors use a deep learning framework to train a species distribution model (SDM) for multi-species predictions. However, the specific optimization technique employed during the training process is not explicitly mentioned. Commonly used optimization techniques in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and its variants like Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), but without explicit mention in the text, it cannot be definitively stated which one was used in this case. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, the exact optimization technique remains unknown.
