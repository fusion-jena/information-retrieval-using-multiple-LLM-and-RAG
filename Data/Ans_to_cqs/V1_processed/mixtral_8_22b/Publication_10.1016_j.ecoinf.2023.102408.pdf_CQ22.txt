Three error statistics are used to evaluate the performance of the machine learning models: R^2, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). These metrics help compare the accuracy of the models. The MAE is calculated using the formula shown in equation 12, where n represents the total number of observations, y_i denotes the actual values, and ^y_i indicates the predicted values.
