The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions made by the model out of all predictions. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made by the model. Recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positives in the data. Other metrics mentioned in the given context include AP (average precision), which is commonly used in object detection tasks, and IoU (intersection over union), which measures the overlap between predicted bounding boxes and ground truth bounding boxes.
