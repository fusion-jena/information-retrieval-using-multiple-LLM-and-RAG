Based on the given information, the raw data for the deep learning pipeline is collected through both survey and commercial fishing. Survey data is gathered over a shorter period of time, focusing on a specific geographical area, while commercial fishing data covers a larger spatial range and longer duration. Biological samples are taken into consideration for this study. More detailed information regarding the sampling designs for commercial and acoustic surveys can be found in Tascheri et al. (2001) and Lillo et al. (2005), respectively. However, the exact methodology or tools used for gathering these data points, such as sensors or public datasets, are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
