Based on the given context, it appears that the text discusses various machine learning models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). However, the context does not explicitly mention any optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). Therefore, based solely on the provided information, we cannot determine which optimization techniques were applied in the deep learning pipeline.
