Unfortunately, there is no information available regarding the use of any data annotation techniques in the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate response to this query.

However, it should be noted that data annotation techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, landmark annotation, and more. Each technique serves a different purpose depending on the type of dataset being worked upon.

Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects in an image to identify their location. Semantic segmentation involves labeling every pixel in an image with its corresponding class, while instance segmentation involves identifying individual instances of objects in an image. Polygon annotation involves outlining complex shapes in an image, and landmark annotation involves marking specific points on an object in an image.

Again, without further context, it is not possible to determine which, if any, of these techniques were used in the study referenced in the given context.
