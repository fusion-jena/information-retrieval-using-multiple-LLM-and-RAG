To monitor the model performance during training, the study employed a five-fold cross-validation strategy. This method involves dividing the dataset into five equal parts or folds. Four of these folds are used for training the model, while the remaining fold is used for validation. This process is repeated five times, each time with a different fold serving as the validation set. By doing so, the entire dataset is utilized for both training and validation, providing a robust measure of the model's performance.
