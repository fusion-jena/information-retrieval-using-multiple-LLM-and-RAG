The information regarding the availability of the deep learning pipeline's data repository on platforms such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. Therefore, it cannot be determined where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available based solely on the provided context. Further research would be required to find out if the authors have made their datasets publicly accessible through any of these repositories.
