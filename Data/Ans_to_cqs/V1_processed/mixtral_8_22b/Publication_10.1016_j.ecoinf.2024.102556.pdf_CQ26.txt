The text does not provide specific details about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some common techniques used to address data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes or labels in both sets. Oversampling increases the size of underrepresented classes by duplicating samples, while undersampling reduces the size of overrepresented classes by removing samples. Diverse data collection aims to gather a wide range of examples representing different variations within each class. These techniques can help improve the performance and generalization of deep learning models by reducing data bias and ensuring fair representation across classes.
