In the given context, it is mentioned that the preprocessed data was divided into three parts for model training and testing purposes. These parts include the training set (80%), the validation set (10%), and the test set (10%). The training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set is utilized to tune the parameters of the model. Lastly, the test set is used to evaluate the final performance of the model. This approach ensures that the model does not see the test data during the training phase, allowing for a more accurate assessment of its performance in real-world scenarios.
