The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is for semantic segmentation. Semantic segmentation is a pixel-wise classification problem aimed at determining the class of the particular pixel of the image it belongs to. This task is typically handled by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and in this case, the authors use U-Net, which is a CNN with an encoder-decoder architecture. The goal here is to identify forest damages, making it a semantic segmentation problem.
