Based on the given context, it appears that the optimization of hyperparameters for the model is not explicitly mentioned or described. However, there are some clues that suggest how hyperparameter tuning may be approached. For instance, the argument 'n.fits' in the ppmlasso package indicates the number of models to fit through the regularization path. This suggests that the model may employ a form of cross-validation or iterative fitting to find optimal hyperparameters. Additionally, the mention of a lasso penalty as a regularization method implies that the model uses some form of hyperparameter tuning to determine the strength of this penalty. Unfortunately, without further context or details about the specific implementation of these functions, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer regarding the exact method used for hyperparameter optimization.
