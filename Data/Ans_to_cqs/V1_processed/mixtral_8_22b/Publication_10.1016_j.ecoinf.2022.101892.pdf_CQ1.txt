The given context does not provide explicit information about the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, there are some indirect references that can be considered. For instance, W\"agele et al. (2022) discuss a multisensor station for automated biodiversity monitoring, which suggests the use of sensor technology for data collection. Additionally, Hu (1987) mentions studying the age and population composition of the giant panda by judging droppings in the wild, indicating field research or observation techniques. Lastly, Jalal et al. (2020) focus on fish detection and species classification in underwater environments using deep learning with temporal information, implying the use of video footage or imagery collected through underwater cameras or other devices. Therefore, based on these sources, one could infer that various methods like sensors, field observations, and publicly available datasets might be employed for gathering raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
