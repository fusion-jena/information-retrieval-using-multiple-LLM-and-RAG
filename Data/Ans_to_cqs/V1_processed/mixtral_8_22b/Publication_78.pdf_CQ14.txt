Based on the provided context, there isn't any explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, such as through methods like grid search or random search. However, it does mention that the width of the Gaussian kernel can be set by the variance, which controls the classifier performance. This implies that tuning the hyperparameters, including the variance, could have been done manually or through other optimization techniques not mentioned in this context. Therefore, without additional information, I cannot provide a specific method used for optimizing the hyperparameters of the model.
