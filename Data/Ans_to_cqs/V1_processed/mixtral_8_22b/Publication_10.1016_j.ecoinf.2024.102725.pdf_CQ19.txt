The provided context does not explicitly mention which specific deep learning framework was used to build the deep-learning enhanced fusion methods mentioned in the paper by Wang et al. (2023). Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer based solely on the given information. However, some commonly used deep learning frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and others. To find out which framework was used in this particular study, further research would be required.
