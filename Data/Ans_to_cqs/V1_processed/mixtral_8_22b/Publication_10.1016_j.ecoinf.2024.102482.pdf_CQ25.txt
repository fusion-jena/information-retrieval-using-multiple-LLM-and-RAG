The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is primarily for classification tasks. This is evident from the description of the model structure, which includes an input layer, three LSTM hidden layers, one dropout layer, and one dense layer. The dense layer is designed differently depending on the type of classification task - for binary classification, it has a single output with sigmoid activation function, while for multi-class classification, it has multiple outputs with softmax activation function. The goal of this model is to classify swimming behaviors of Caenorhabditis elegans based on their BLS entropy profiles. The simplicity of the model structure is intentional, aimed at making it usable on devices with limited computing power and enabling real-time predictions, all while maintaining good performance.
