The text mentions one specific method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline - L2 regularization. This technique adds a penalty term to the loss function during training, encouraging smaller weights and thus reducing complexity in the model. By doing so, L2 regularization helps prevent overfitting and improves generalization performance. However, the text does not explicitly mention other regularization techniques such as dropout or early stopping. Dropout randomly drops out neurons during training to reduce co-dependency among them, while early stopping halts the training process once validation error starts increasing. These methods can further help mitigate overfitting in deep learning models.
