The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include rotation, flipping, and zooming. These techniques were implemented using the Rasterio library to augment the original image tiles. Data augmentation is crucial for improving the robustness of the deep learning model by creating new training examples from existing ones, thereby increasing the diversity of the dataset and reducing overfitting. Rotation involves rotating the image by a certain angle, while flipping refers to reflecting the image along one of its axes. Zooming entails scaling the image up or down, effectively changing its size without altering its content. By applying these transformations, the model can learn to recognize objects under various conditions, making it more versatile and reliable.
