The text does not provide information about the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline of BirdNET. Regularization methods like dropout and L2 regularization are commonly used in deep learning models to prevent overfitting, but the given context does not mention whether they were applied in this case. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which regularization methods were used based solely on the provided information.
