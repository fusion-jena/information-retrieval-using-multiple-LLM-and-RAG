The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific strategies implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it discusses various aspects related to the classification performance of different methods using single CNN-based models and the fusion of selected CNN-based models. It also mentions the use of different architectures like SubSpectralNet and the selection of 40 mel-bin for further analysis due to its balance between computational load and classification accuracy. Unfortunately, without additional information or context, I cannot provide a detailed response regarding the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training.
