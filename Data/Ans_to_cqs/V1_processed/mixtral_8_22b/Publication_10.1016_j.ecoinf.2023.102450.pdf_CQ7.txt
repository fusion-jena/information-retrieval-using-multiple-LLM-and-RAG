The text does not provide explicit information about how the data is split for deep learning model training. However, it can be inferred from the context that the authors use a few-shot learning approach due to having an insufficient number of samples in their dataset. In this case, they define their classification task as an N-way K-shot problem, which means they have N different categories, each containing K labeled samples. For their specific application, they perform two-way one-shot learning, implying that they have only two classes (target and non-target) and one sample per class for training purposes. Although the exact splitting criteria are not mentioned, typically, datasets are divided into three parts: training, testing, and validation sets. The training set is used to fit the model parameters, while the validation set helps tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Lastly, the testing set evaluates the final performance of the trained model.
