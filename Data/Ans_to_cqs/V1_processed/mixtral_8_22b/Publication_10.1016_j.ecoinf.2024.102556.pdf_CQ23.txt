To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken due to the unique nature of the self-defined dataset containing only one category. These measures aimed to address concerns such as overfitting, the inability to assess the model's generalization ability, and uneven data distribution affecting prediction rates.

Firstly, the dataset was divided into five subsets using k-fold cross-validation. Each subset served as a validation set, while the remaining four subsets formed the training set. This division allowed for multiple rounds of training and validation, ensuring that every sample was included in both processes but in different subsets. Specifically, the YOLOv7 detection model underwent five rounds of training and validation, which helped evaluate its generalizability.

This approach resulted in a prediction rate close to 1, indicating that the five YOLOv7 models utilized all the samples in the dataset efficiently. Moreover, the use of k-fold cross-validation ensured that each sample was trained and validated in a different subset, further enhancing the model's robustness and generalizability.
