The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves calculating several model performance metrics for each species and for two disjoint and randomly sampled subsets of sites - a train set and a test set. The train set, consisting of 4781 sites, is used for fitting all models, while the test set, comprising 400 sites, aims to test the models' generalization capabilities. These train and test metrics are then averaged over the 50 species. An essential metric considered is the mean loss, also known as loss, which is relevant to their ecological model and serves as the objective function minimized during model training.
