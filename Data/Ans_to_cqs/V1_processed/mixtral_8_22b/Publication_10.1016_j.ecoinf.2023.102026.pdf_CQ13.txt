The given context does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. It primarily discusses the use of Random Forests (RF) algorithm and Generalized Linear Models (GLM), focusing on the importance of data structure and scale in these models rather than the details of their implementation. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information based on the available context.
