The text does not explicitly mention any specific dataset like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it mentions that nearly 30,000 labeled samples were used per class for training the custom CNN. These samples were likely collected by the authors themselves for this particular study, rather than being part of a standard benchmark dataset. Therefore, no well-known dataset names can be given based on the provided information.
