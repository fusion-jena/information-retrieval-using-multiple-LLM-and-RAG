The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of early stopping technique. This technique involves splitting the dataset into two parts - 80% for model training and 20% for model testing or validation. During the training process, the model weights are randomly initialized. The training process is stopped when the network begins to overfit the data, i.e., the error on the validation set starts increasing. By monitoring the error on the validation set, the model can prevent overfitting and maintain its ability to generalize well on unseen data.
