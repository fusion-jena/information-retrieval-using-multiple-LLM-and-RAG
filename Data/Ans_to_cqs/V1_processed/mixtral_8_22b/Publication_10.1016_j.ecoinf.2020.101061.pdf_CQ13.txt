The text does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the model was trained for 40 epochs after retraining with hand-annotated data. Additionally, data augmentation techniques like random flips and translations were tested but did not significantly impact the final score.
