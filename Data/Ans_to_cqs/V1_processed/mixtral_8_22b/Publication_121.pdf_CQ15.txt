In the given context, two optimization techniques are mentioned for training the deep learning models - Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam.

The first model, based on MobileNetV2, is optimized using the Adam optimizer. Adam is a popular optimization algorithm used in deep learning due to its ability to adaptively adjust the learning rate for each parameter. It combines the advantages of AdaGrad and RMSProp, providing an efficient method for gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions.

On the other hand, the second model, based on MobileNetV3, is optimized using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with a learning rate of 0.5 and momentum of 0.9. SGD is another widely used optimization technique in deep learning. It updates the model parameters based on the average of gradients computed on randomly chosen individual examples from the training dataset. Momentum is often used alongside SGD to help accelerate convergence by accumulating past gradients and moving faster towards the optimal solution.

Both models are trained within 10 to 100 epochs, allowing them to learn from the training data multiple times and improve their performance. Additionally, fine-tuning is performed on the models to further enhance their performance on the specific leaf classification task. Fine-tuning involves unfreezing the base models and retraining the weights of the top layers along with the classifier layer added earlier. This allows the models to tune their weights from general feature maps to those specifically associated with the leaf dataset.
