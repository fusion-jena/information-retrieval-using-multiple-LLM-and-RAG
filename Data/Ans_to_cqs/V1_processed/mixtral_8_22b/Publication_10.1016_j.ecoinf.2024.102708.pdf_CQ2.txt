The article discusses the use of drone imagery for mapping the density of wild Pacific oysters using deep learning techniques. Therefore, it can be inferred that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images or image datasets. These images likely consist of aerial photographs captured by drones over various landscapes, including mudflats and rocky shores. The deep learning models employed in this research, namely YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN, are both designed for object detection tasks within images, further supporting the conclusion that the input data consists primarily of visual information.
