Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of how the hyperparameters of the models were optimized. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether techniques such as grid search or random search were employed for this purpose. However, these methods are commonly used for hyperparameter optimization in machine learning models. Grid search involves specifying a set of possible values for each parameter and then exhaustively trying all combinations of parameters within those sets. Random search, on the other hand, randomly samples points in the space defined by the possible values of each parameter. Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages, depending on factors like computational resources available and the complexity of the model being trained. In any case, further details about the specific methodology used for hyperparameter optimization would need to be obtained directly from the source material or authors of the study.
