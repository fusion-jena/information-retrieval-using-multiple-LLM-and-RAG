Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, the text does discuss various strategies employed to enhance the performance of the classifiers used in the study. These include training data augmentation, post-classification methods like segmentation and filtering, dealing with geometry of training data, exclusion of outliers, refinement of training samples, and adjustment of proportions between training and testing data. Additionally, the authors utilized R software along with the caret package for conducting classifications and hyperparameter tuning. It should be noted that while these approaches contribute to improving classification accuracy, they do not directly correspond to traditional data annotation techniques typically associated with deep learning pipelines.
