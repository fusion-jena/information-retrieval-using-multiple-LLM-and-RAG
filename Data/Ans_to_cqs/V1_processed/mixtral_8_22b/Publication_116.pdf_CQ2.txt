The information provided does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the data format used is likely images. This is suggested by the discussion of using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are commonly used for image classification tasks, and the reference to the impressive results obtained in the ImageNet challenge, a large-scale image recognition task. Additionally, the term 'leaf-scan images' is mentioned, further supporting the idea that the data format used is images. Therefore, it can be concluded that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is most likely images.
