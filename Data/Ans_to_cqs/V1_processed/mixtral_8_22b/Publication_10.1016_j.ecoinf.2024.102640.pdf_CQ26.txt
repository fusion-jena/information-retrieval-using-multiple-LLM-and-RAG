To address underrepresented classes and improve the balance of their dataset, the authors of GreenCam have implemented several data augmentation techniques. These techniques include random rotations, scaling, and flipping of images. By using these methods, they aim to help the model generalize better without compromising the diversity of the dataset. This approach aligns with common strategies used to mitigate data bias during preprocessing of deep learning pipelines.

Stratified splitting is another technique often employed to ensure that each subset of the data contains roughly the same proportions of class labels or other features as the original dataset. This method helps prevent overfitting and ensures that the model performs well across all categories.

Oversampling and undersampling are also frequently utilized to handle imbalanced datasets. Oversampling involves duplicating examples from the minority class, while undersampling removes instances from the majority class. Both approaches aim to create a more balanced distribution of samples among classes. However, it should be noted that oversampling may lead to overfitting if not managed carefully, while undersampling could result in loss of valuable information.

Diverse data collection is yet another strategy to tackle data bias. Collecting data from various sources, locations, or scenarios can increase the overall representation of different groups within the dataset. This approach was adopted by the authors of GreenCam when expanding the geographical scope of their data collection to encompass diverse urban settings and varying levels of urban green density.

In summary, the authors of GreenCam employ data augmentation techniques such as random rotations, scaling, and flipping of images to enhance the balance of their dataset. Other commonly used methods to counteract data bias during preprocessing include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.
