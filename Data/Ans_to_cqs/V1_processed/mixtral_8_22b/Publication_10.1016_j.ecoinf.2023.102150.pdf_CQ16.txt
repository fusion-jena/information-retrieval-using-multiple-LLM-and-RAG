The context does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, based on common practices in machine learning, one possible criterion could be reaching a validation loss plateau. This means that the model has learned most of what it can learn from the current dataset, and further training will not significantly improve its performance. Other potential criteria could include achieving a desired level of accuracy or precision on the validation set, or meeting other predefined performance metrics. It is important to note that the choice of criteria may depend on the specific goals and requirements of the project.

The context also mentions the possibility of improving model performance through manual selection of additional training images and subsequent retraining. This suggests that the decision to stop training and consider the model finalized may involve a subjective assessment of its performance, rather than strictly adhering to quantitative criteria. Ultimately, the determination of when training is complete will likely require careful consideration of both objective performance metrics and subjective judgments regarding the model's suitability for its intended use case.
