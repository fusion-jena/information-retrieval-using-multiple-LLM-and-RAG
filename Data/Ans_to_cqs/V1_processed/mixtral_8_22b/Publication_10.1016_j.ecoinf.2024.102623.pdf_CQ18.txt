The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using a specific loss function called L_full. This loss function is designed to handle imbalanced datasets with multiple classes, which is common in ecological studies where there are many more absence points than presence points for any given species. The L_full loss function consists of three terms, each addressing a different type of sample: presences, absences, and background samples. Presence samples receive a higher weight through a coefficient lambda to account for their relative scarcity compared to absence or background samples. By minimizing this loss function during training, the model aims to accurately predict species distributions while accounting for the inherent class imbalance in the data.
