The given context does not provide specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of Word2Vec, a popular word embedding technique developed by Mikolov et al. (2013). While training this model, one might use various optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). These methods help minimize the loss function during the training process. Nevertheless, without explicit mention in the provided context, it cannot be confirmed which optimization techniques were employed in their deep learning pipeline.
