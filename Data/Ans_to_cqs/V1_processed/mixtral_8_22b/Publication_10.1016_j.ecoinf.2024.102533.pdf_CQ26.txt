The provided context does not directly discuss specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some general concepts related to data processing and evaluation in machine learning.

Data bias can be addressed through various techniques during preprocessing. One common approach is stratified sampling, where the training set is divided into subsets or strata, ensuring each subset has approximately the same proportion of observations from each target class. This helps maintain the overall distribution of the target variable when creating training and validation sets.

Oversampling and undersampling are also popular techniques to handle imbalanced datasets. Oversampling increases the minority class size by replicating its instances, while undersampling reduces the majority class size by randomly removing instances. Both approaches aim to balance the dataset and improve model performance.

Diverse data collection is another strategy to mitigate data bias. Collecting diverse data ensures that the dataset represents all possible scenarios, reducing the risk of biased models due to underrepresented cases.

While the provided context does not explicitly cover these techniques, they are commonly used in addressing data bias during preprocessing in deep learning pipelines.
