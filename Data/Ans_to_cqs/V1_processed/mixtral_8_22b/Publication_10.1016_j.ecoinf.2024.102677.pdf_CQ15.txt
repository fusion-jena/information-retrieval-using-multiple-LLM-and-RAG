Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that they employed deep learning techniques to predict landscape types and fine-tuned several state-of-the-art CNN architectures such as VGG, Inception, and ResNet. These architectures typically use optimization algorithms like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) during the training phase. Without explicit mention of the optimization technique used, one can only speculate that either SGD or Adam might have been utilized, considering their popularity in deep learning applications.
