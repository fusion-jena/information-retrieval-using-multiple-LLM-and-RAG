To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed. One common approach is to use fixed random seeds during training to ensure reproducibility of results. This involves setting the same seed value before each run of the model, so that the initial weights and biases, as well as any other stochastic processes such as dropout or shuffling of input data, remain consistent across runs. Another strategy is to perform multiple runs with different random seeds and average the results to reduce variability due to random initialization. Additionally, techniques such as batch normalization and weight decay can help stabilize the optimization process and improve generalization performance. Finally, careful hyperparameter tuning and regularization methods like early stopping can also mitigate the effects of randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
