Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model mentioned in the given context. However, some common hyperparameters used in deep learning models include learning rate, batch size, epochs, optimizers like Adam or Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and regularization methods like dropout or weight decay. Without more details, I cannot provide a precise list of hyperparameters used in the deep learning model discussed in the text.
