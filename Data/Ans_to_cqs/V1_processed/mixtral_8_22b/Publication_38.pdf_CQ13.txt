Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning models such as learning rate or optimizer. However, it does mention some architectural aspects of the CNNFULL and CNNFAST networks. For example, CNNFULL has three convolution and max pooling layers followed by one fully connected layer, while CNNFAST has two convolution layers with 16 filters each, both followed by max pooling layers, and ending with a fully connected layer with 64 units. It also mentions that the input spectrogram was halved to reduce its dimensionality, resulting in an input array of size 130 frequency bins by 20 time steps.
