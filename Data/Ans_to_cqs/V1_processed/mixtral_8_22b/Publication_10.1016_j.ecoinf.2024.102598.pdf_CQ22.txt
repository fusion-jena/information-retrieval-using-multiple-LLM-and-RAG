The performance of each Machine Learning Model (MLM) was evaluated using several metrics such as Area Under Curve (AUC), True Skill Statistics (TSS), Kappa, and Phi. The outcomes of these evaluations are presented in Table 3. Additionally, Figure 4 visually illustrates the predictive performance of each model with AUC values for both training and test datasets. The performance of the remaining models displayed only slight variations within a small range, as shown in Table 3. There was no discernible variation in the classifiers’ prediction accuracy according to the Kruskal-Wallis statistic (p > 0.05). Model complexity was evaluated for each case by computing the difference between the AUC (train) and AUC (CV), represented as Δ AUC. The Δ AUC scores from each model offer insights into their sensitivity to the training data. Moreover, the Kruskal-Wallis test was conducted to determine whether a significant difference in prediction accuracy exists among the classifiers.
