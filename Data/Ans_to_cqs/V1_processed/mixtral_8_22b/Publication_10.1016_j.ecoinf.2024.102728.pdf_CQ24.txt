The papers provided do not directly address the specific issue of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing the impact of different random seed values. However, some common strategies used in machine learning and deep learning pipelines to manage randomness include:

1. Fixing the Random Seed Value: One way to ensure reproducibility and consistency across experiments is to fix the random seed value. This ensures that any random processes, like shuffling data or initializing weights, will be consistent between runs.

2. Cross-Validation: To reduce the effect of randomness due to splitting datasets into training and testing sets, cross-validation techniques can be employed. These methods involve dividing the dataset into multiple subsets and rotating them through training and validation phases. Common types of cross-validation include k-fold cross-validation and leave-one-out cross-validation.

3. Ensemble Methods: Another strategy to mitigate the effects of randomness is using ensemble methods. By combining multiple models trained independently, it becomes possible to achieve better performance and robustness against variations caused by random initialization or other stochastic elements. Examples of ensemble methods include bagging, boosting, and stacking.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing hyperparameters can also help improve model stability and reduce sensitivity to random factors. Techniques like grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization can be used to find optimal hyperparameters for a given problem.
