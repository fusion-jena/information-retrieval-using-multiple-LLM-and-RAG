The paper does not provide information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that the authors used a list of cropped thumbnails and their labels, which were sent to their network. They also mention using inception layers based on GoogLeNet architecture and adapting some parameters such as the size of the strides and the first convolutions to achieve better results than a classic architecture. However, there is no explicit reference to a specific data repository or dataset used in the study. Therefore, without additional information, it is impossible to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
