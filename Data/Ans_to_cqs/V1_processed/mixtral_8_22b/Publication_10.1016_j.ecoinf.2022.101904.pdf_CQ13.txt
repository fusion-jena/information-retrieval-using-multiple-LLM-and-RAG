Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information regarding the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning models mentioned, such as the learning rate or optimizer. It primarily focuses on presenting the results of various models, including ViT, ST, CoAtNet, CNN + ST, GAN + ST, and 3DUNetGSFormer, without delving into their respective hyperparameter settings. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based solely on the provided context.
