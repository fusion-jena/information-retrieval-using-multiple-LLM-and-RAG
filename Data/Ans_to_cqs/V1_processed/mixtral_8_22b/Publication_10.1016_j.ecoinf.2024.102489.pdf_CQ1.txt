The study utilizes high spatial resolution satellite image data for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, it employs three types of satellite data: Landsat-8, GF-1, and Sentinel-2A. These satellites provide imagery with varying degrees of cloud cover, strip numbers, and time frames. The data sources for these satellite images include USGS Earth Explorer, CRESDA, and Copernicus databases. Additionally, the MOD09A1 dataset is used, which is synthesized by selecting the best quality observations from the Terra and Aqua sensors within eight days. This dataset has the same spatial and temporal resolution as the MODIS LAI product and can exclude pixels affected by factors like cloud pollution and cloud shadows using QC and state layers.
