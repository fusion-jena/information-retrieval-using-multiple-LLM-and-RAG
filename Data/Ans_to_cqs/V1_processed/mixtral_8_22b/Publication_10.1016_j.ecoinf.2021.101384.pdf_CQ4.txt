Unfortunately, there isn't any information about specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, or scaling being applied in this deep learning pipeline. This text focuses on using a multi-resolution decision approach and statistical analysis for handling large input datasets and improving data quality. It mentions the importance of providing statistically significant data and selecting the most appropriate spatial resolution for analysis. However, no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling is found in the given context.
