The given context does not provide information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It discusses various aspects related to machine learning models, including a flexible and complete neighborhood relation Rk, an intelligent cellular scheme, and the use of a backpropagation algorithm and Gumbel softmax function. However, there is no mention of any specific code repositories or platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
