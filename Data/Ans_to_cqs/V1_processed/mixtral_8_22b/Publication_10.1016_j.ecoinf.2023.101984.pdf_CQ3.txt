The given context does not provide information on the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based on the given context.

Based on general knowledge, some common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include:

* Bounding Box Annotation: This technique involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects in images to identify their location and size. It is commonly used for object detection tasks.
* Instance Segmentation: This technique involves identifying individual instances of objects within an image by outlining their boundaries. It is often used for semantic segmentation tasks.
* Semantic Segmentation: This technique involves classifying each pixel in an image into one of several predefined categories. It is useful for scene understanding tasks.
* Keypoint Annotation: This technique involves marking specific points on objects within an image, such as joints on a human body. It is often used for pose estimation tasks.
* Polygon Annotation: This technique involves tracing the outline of objects within an image using polygons. It can be used for both object detection and instance segmentation tasks.
