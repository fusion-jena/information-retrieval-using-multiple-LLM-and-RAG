The given context does not provide information about specific optimization techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) being applied in the deep learning pipeline. Instead, it discusses the use of two common variable elimination techniques for random forests: Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Variable Selection Using Random Forests (VSURF). These methods help prevent potential performance degradation of the model and avoid overfitting by removing unnecessary features from the dataset. However, these techniques do not fall under the category of optimization techniques typically used in deep learning pipelines, such as SGD or Adam.
