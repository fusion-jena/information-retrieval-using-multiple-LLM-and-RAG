The criteria used to determine when training is complete is based on monitoring the model's validation performance. Training continues until there is no further improvement in validation performance after a certain number of epochs. In this case, the threshold was set to stop training if no increase in validation performance was observed after 25 epochs. However, it is noted that other thresholds could also be considered depending on the time resources available. The 'optimal' number of training epochs is determined as the one that provides the best validation performance. Once the optimal number of epochs has been identified, the final performance of the model is evaluated using a separate test dataset, which gives the best estimate of the predictive performance of the model.
