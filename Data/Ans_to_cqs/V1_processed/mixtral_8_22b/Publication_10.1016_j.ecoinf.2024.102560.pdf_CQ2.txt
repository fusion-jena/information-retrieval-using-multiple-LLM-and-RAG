Based on the given context, the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline include satellite-based datasets such as MODIS and CMAP. Specifically, MOD13Q1 is used to calculate NDVI at 250 m, while MOD11A2 is used to obtain day-time land surface temperature. Additionally, Landsat satellite datasets were used to investigate water surface area and salinity variations over a long period of time. The data format for these datasets is likely raster or geospatial data, which is commonly used in remote sensing applications. However, the exact file format (such as GeoTIFF, NetCDF, etc.) is not specified in the given context.
