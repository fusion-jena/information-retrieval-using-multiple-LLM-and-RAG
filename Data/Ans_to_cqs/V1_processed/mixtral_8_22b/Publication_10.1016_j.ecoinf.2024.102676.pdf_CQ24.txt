The given context does not provide information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some common strategies used to manage randomness in deep learning pipelines include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, employing techniques like cross-validation and ensemble methods to reduce variance caused by random initialization, and using deterministic algorithms whenever possible. Additionally, hyperparameter tuning can help find optimal configurations that minimize the impact of randomness on model performance.

Based on the provided context, it appears that the authors recommend using tree-based nonparametric imputation methods like missForest, missRanger, or MICE RF before applying the FIT algorithm. These methods use Random Forests, which have been shown to perform well in high-dimensional and non-linear data structures commonly found in real datasets. MissForest, specifically, is a Random Forest-based algorithm that imputes missing values iteratively using Random Forests trained on subsets of the dataset. Each variable containing missing values is treated as a target variable, and a dedicated Random Forest model is trained for each target variable using the remaining variables as predictors. This process is repeated until a predefined stopping criterion is met.

However, this information does not directly address the query regarding strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based solely on the given context.
