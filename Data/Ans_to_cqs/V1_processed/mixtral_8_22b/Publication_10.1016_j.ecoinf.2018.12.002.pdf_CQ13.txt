The given context does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in any deep learning models. However, it mentions several machine learning algorithms such as neural networks, CARTs, linear discriminant analysis, random forests, and support vector machines. These algorithms can have various hyperparameters depending on their implementation. For example, neural networks might use hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, optimizer type (like Adam or SGD), etc. Random Forests could include parameters like the number of trees, maximum depth of each tree, minimum samples required to split a node, etc. Support Vector Machines might involve hyperparameters like kernel type (linear, polynomial, radial basis function, sigmoid), regularization parameter (C), gamma value, etc. But without more specific details about the exact models used in this context, we cannot determine the precise hyperparameters employed.
