The given context does not provide information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The context discusses the effects of sample size on the performance of species distribution models and introduces a new method for correcting the effect of sampling bias in species distribution modeling when there is a low number of presence data. However, it does not mention any specific data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
