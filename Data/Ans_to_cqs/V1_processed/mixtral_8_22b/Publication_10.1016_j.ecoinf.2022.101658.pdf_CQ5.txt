In this study, the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned as popular datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the authors use custom datasets consisting of field measurements and raw photos collected at three different field sites: Pelican Mountain (PM), Calling Lake (CL), and Conklin (CK). The manual classification of fuel types used in semantic segmentation training and testing were limited to data collected at PM and CL. Additionally, field measurement data and raw photos from the CK field site were used solely for independent validation. Therefore, the specific datasets used in this study are unique to the research and not publicly available benchmark datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
