The criterion used to determine when training is complete is the stabilization of the loss curve in the four folds of the cross-validation. This means that the training continues until the loss curve stops changing significantly, indicating that the model has learned all it can from the training data. Additionally, the number of epochs was adjusted to the minimum number of epochs that guaranteed this stabilization, ensuring that the model does not overfit the training data by continuing to train after it has already converged.
