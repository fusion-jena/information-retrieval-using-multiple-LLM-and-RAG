The text does not explicitly mention any specific optimization technique such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it does indicate that the training process employs a form of gradient descent optimizer, specifically RMSProp, which is mentioned as being used with a decaying learning rate schedule. This information can be inferred from the statement that mentions the use of RMSProp with a decaying learning rate schedule to speed up training, referencing a paper by Tieleman and Hinton published in 2012. Therefore, based on this context, we can conclude that the deep learning pipeline utilizes RMSProp as its optimization technique.
