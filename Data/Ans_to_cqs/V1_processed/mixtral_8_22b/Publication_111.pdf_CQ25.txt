The purpose of the deep learning model used in this research is not explicitly stated as either classification, segmentation, or detection. However, based on the given information, it appears that the deep learning model is designed for prediction purposes. Specifically, the model is intended to predict the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Significant Wave Height (SWH) for the Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency dataset. This suggests that the model may fall under the category of regression tasks within the broader field of supervised learning. Furthermore, the model employs a unique architecture that combines gated recurrent units (GRUs) with a regular neural network. This indicates that the model is likely designed to handle sequential data, such as time series data, which is common in weather and oceanography datasets. Therefore, while the specific type of deep learning task is not directly mentioned, it can be inferred that the model serves a predictive role in estimating continuous variables related to marine conditions.
