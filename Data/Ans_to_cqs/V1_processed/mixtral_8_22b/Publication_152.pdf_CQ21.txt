According to the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, based on common practices and the information available, we can infer some possible postprocessing steps.

Firstly, it appears that the authors used F1 score and Jaccard index as evaluation metrics for their trained network. Therefore, one of the postprocessing steps would be calculating these metrics using the test set results to evaluate the performance of the U-Net model.

Additionally, since the goal was to identify Hedychium Coronarium, a specific invasive vegetation species, from images captured by a drone, another potential postprocessing step could involve visualizing the output of the model on new input images. This might include generating saliency maps or heatmaps to highlight areas where the model detects the presence of the target species. These visualizations can help researchers better understand how well the model performs and whether any adjustments need to be made.

Finally, while not explicitly mentioned in the context, creating confusion matrices could also serve as a useful postprocessing step. A confusion matrix provides a more detailed breakdown of the model's performance by showing true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. This can offer valuable insights into which classes the model struggles with most and guide further improvements.
