Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that some form of data balancing or augmentation might have been employed due to the nature of insect diversity and variable abundance mentioned in the text.

Stratified splitting could potentially be used to ensure that all classes are represented proportionately across train, test, and validation sets. Oversampling or undersampling could also be applied to balance the dataset if certain classes are underrepresented or overrepresented, respectively. Additionally, collecting diverse data could help mitigate biases introduced by having a narrow range of samples.

While none of these techniques are explicitly stated in the provided context, they remain viable options for addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
