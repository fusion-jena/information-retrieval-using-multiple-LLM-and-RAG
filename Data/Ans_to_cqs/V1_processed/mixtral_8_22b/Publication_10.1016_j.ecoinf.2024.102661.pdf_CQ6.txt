While the given context does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps for preparing data before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning, these are common practices in machine learning and deep learning projects. Preprocessing typically involves transforming raw data into a format suitable for analysis by applying various techniques like normalization, scaling, encoding categorical variables, handling missing values, removing noise, etc. However, it should be noted that the exact preprocessing steps depend on the nature of the data and the requirements of the particular problem being addressed. Therefore, without additional information about the specific use case, it would be difficult to provide a definitive list of preprocessing steps required before training a deep learning model.
