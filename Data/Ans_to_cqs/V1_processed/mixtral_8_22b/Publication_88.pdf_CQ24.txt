To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as variations caused by different random seed values, several strategies can be employed. One common approach is to perform multiple runs or experiments with different initializations and then aggregate the results. This technique, known as ensemble learning, helps mitigate the impact of individual model variance and improves overall performance. Another strategy involves setting specific random seeds during development and testing phases to ensure reproducibility and consistency across experiments. Additionally, techniques like weight initialization schemes, batch normalization, and dropout regularization can help stabilize the learning process and reduce sensitivity to random factors.
