Based on the given context, it is not explicitly stated what data format is used in the deep learning pipeline. However, since the context discusses retrieving EOS data catalogues from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) online repository using ee.ImageCollection(), we can infer that the data format being used is likely images or raster data. This is further supported by the mention of applying masks to the data, which is a common practice when working with image data. Therefore, while it cannot be definitively confirmed without additional information, it appears that the data format used in this case is most likely image data.
