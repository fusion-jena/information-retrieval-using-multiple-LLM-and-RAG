To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the data was divided into a training set (80% of the data) and a test set (20% of the data). This split allows the models to be trained on one portion of the data and tested on a separate, previously unseen portion. This approach helps to assess the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data accurately. Additionally, during the grid search process, the focus was on minimizing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) to identify the optimal set of hyperparameters. This step further contributes to improving the model's performance and its ability to generalize. However, there is no explicit mention of other techniques such as cross-validation, stratified splitting, or ensuring diversity in the dataset.
