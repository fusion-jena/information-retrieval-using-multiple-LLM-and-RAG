In the given context, the optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline is the Adam algorithm. Adam is a stochastic gradient descent method that is used as the optimizer. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) methods are popular optimization algorithms used in machine learning and deep learning due to their efficiency and ease of implementation. They work by updating the parameters of the model based on the average of the gradients computed from batches of data. The Adam algorithm is a variant of SGD that incorporates momentum and adaptive learning rates, making it more efficient and robust compared to traditional SGD. It has been widely adopted in various applications such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition.
