Two main metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model: accuracy and precision. Accuracy is calculated as the sum of true positives (TP) and true negatives (TN) divided by the total number of signals (N). This metric evaluates the model's ability to correctly classify both classes. Precision is computed as the ratio of true positives (TP) to the sum of true positives (TP) and false positives (FP). This metric measures the model's ability to accurately identify boatwhistle calls.
