The paper proposes a deep learning framework for highway air quality monitoring and prediction. However, it does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Nevertheless, based on the information given, we can infer that the REVIS system, which was used as a case study to develop and validate the proposed framework, employs IoT hardware for data collection. Therefore, it can be assumed that sensors or similar IoT devices are likely being used to collect raw data for the deep learning pipeline. Unfortunately, without more explicit details from the authors, we cannot provide further insight into the exact types of sensors or devices employed by the REVIS system.
