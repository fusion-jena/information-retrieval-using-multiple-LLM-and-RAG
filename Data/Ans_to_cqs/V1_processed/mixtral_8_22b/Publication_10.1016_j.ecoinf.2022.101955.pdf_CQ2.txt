In this study, the authors focus on using satellite image data for land use and land cover (LULC) mapping. Specifically, they mention using Landsat imagery from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. The data format used in their deep learning pipeline is primarily satellite image data. This type of data is typically stored in raster file formats like GeoTIFF or JPEG2000, which support georeferencing information necessary for spatial analysis. Other potential data formats mentioned include training datasets used for minimizing classification errors in machine learning algorithms. However, the specific format of these datasets is not explicitly stated in the given context.
