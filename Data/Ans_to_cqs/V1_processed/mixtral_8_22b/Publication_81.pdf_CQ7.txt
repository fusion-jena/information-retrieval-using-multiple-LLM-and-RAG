In the given context, there is no explicit mention of the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to use a random stratified sampling approach to divide the available data into these subsets. This ensures that the distribution of classes or labels in the original dataset is preserved in each subset. Typically, the data is divided into three parts: training set (used to fit the model), validation set (used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting), and testing set (used to evaluate the final model performance). The proportion of data allocated to each subset may vary depending on the size of the dataset and the complexity of the task. For instance, a common split might be 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing.
