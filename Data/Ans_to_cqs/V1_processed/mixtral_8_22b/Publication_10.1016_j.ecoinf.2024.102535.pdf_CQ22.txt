The performance of the deep learning classifiers is evaluated using the average F1-scores computed for each individual class. The F1-score is calculated as the harmonic mean of Precision (Pc) and Recall (Rc). Precision is defined as the ratio of true positive (tp) images correctly assigned to the class c to the total number of images predicted as belonging to class c (including both true positives and false positives). Recall is defined as the ratio of true positive images to the sum of true positives and false negatives (fn), where false negatives correspond to images incorrectly classified as not belonging to class c.
