The study uses several statistical measures to rank and evaluate the performance of machine learning (ML) models. These include prediction performance metrics such as R^2, Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), Mean Error Function (MEF), and Z-statistics. Additionally, they use Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSE) and Standard Deviation (SD) to measure error rates. They also consider model sensitivity by examining R^2 values across different models. To holistically view multiple metrics, they employ Taylor diagrams. Each metric offers a unique perspective, enabling a tailored evaluation based on specific modeling objectives and dataset characteristics. For instance, MAE sheds light on prediction accuracy, while R^2 measures goodness of fit. NSE and MEF assess performance relative to benchmarks, and Z-statistics determine statistical significance.
