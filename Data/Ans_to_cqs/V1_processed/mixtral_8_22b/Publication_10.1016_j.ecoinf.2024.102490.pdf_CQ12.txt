The given context does not provide information about the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, there are mentions of various machine learning models such as eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Generalized Additive Model (GAM), Structured Error Regression (SER), Functional Data Analysis (FDA), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Random Forest (RF), Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), MaxNet, and others. These are not specifically deep learning models but rather traditional machine learning algorithms. Therefore, based on the given context, we cannot determine what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline.
