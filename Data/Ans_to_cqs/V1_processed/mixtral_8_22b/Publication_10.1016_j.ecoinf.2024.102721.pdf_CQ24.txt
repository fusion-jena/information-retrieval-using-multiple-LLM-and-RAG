Unfortunately, there isn't any explicit mention or discussion about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline within the given context. However, some common strategies used to manage randomness include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using ensemble models, and employing techniques like cross-validation and bootstrapping. These methods help ensure consistent results across multiple runs and improve overall performance.
