The given context does not provide information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. It only discusses the use of artificial neural networks for fitting the drivers and mechanisms of Land Use and Cover Change (LUCC) but does not mention any details regarding the deployment of the trained model. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this query based on the given context.
