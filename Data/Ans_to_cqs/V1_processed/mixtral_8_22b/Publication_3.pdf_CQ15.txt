The text does not provide explicit information about specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are employed for image classification tasks, which typically involve some form of gradient descent optimization algorithm during their training process. Additionally, the use of TensorFlow, an open-source software library for machine intelligence, suggests that standard optimization techniques available within this framework might have been utilized. Nonetheless, without further context or explicit mention of optimization techniques like SGD or Adam, one cannot definitively assert which specific optimization algorithms were applied in the deep learning pipeline.
