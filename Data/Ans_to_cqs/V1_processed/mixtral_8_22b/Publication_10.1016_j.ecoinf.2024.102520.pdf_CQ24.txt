To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed. One common approach is using fixed seeds for reproducibility. By setting a specific seed value, the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers will be generated each time the code runs, ensuring consistent results across different executions. Another strategy involves averaging over multiple runs with different initializations or data shuffling orders. This technique, known as ensemble learning, helps reduce variance and improve overall performance by combining predictions from individual models trained on slightly varied inputs. Additionally, techniques such as dropout regularization and batch normalization can also help mitigate the effects of randomness during training by introducing controlled noise into the network architecture and activations respectively.
