The text does not provide specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the success of deep neural networks in the supervised regime depends on the availability of a massive corpus of audio examples for the sound events of interest, paired with human annotations. It also notes that temporally-precise and fine-grained annotation of audio demands expertise, and is thus costly and time-consuming. Additionally, the text discusses the use of neural network architectures specifically trained to infer and output region annotations. Therefore, while the exact techniques are not specified, we can infer that some form of temporal annotation or region annotation is likely being used in the deep learning pipeline for bioacoustics.
