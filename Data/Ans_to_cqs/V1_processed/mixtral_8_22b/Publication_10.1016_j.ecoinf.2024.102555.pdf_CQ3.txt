The papers mentioned do not provide specific information on the data annotation techniques used in their respective deep learning pipelines. However, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation.

Bounding box annotation involves drawing a rectangle around each object of interest within an image. This technique is often used for tasks such as object detection or localization. Semantic segmentation involves labeling every pixel in an image with a class label, which can be useful for identifying different types of objects or regions within an image. Instance segmentation combines both bounding box annotation and semantic segmentation by identifying individual instances of objects within an image while also providing detailed outlines of those objects.

Without more specific information about the datasets and models used in these studies, it is difficult to determine exactly which data annotation techniques were employed. However, based on the general nature of the research topics covered in these papers, it is likely that some combination of these techniques was utilized.
