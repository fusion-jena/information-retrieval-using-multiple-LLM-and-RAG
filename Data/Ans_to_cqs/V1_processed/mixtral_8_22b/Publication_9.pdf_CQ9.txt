The article does not explicitly mention where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it cites several related works that have published their datasets or tools on platforms such as GitHub, Zenodo, and Figshare. For instance, Van Belleghem et al. (2018) published their R package 'patternize' on GitHub, while Van Horn et al. (2018) made their iNaturalist Species Classification and Detection Dataset available on Zenodo. Given these examples, it is possible that the authors may also publish their deep learning pipeline on a similar platform. Nevertheless, without explicit information, we cannot definitively state where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
