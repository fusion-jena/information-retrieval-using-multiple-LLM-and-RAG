The specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, it does mention that the study uses a combination of both vision and acoustic-based data for bird classification. It also mentions that the approach outlined in this paper was compared with more advanced network architectures such as 1D CNN's using features extracted from visual spectrogram representations of foreground species recordings. Additionally, it discusses combining hand-crafted features with deep learning to classify fourteen different bird species using three different feature types (acoustic features, visual features, and those generated using deep-learning). Therefore, while the exact datasets used are not specified, it can be inferred that the study likely used custom datasets containing both image and audio data related to various bird species.
