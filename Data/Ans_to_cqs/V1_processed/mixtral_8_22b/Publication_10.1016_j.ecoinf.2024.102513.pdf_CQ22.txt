Two main metrics are employed to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model used for Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) classification on the Kerch Peninsula: Overall Accuracy and Kappa Coefficient.

The Overall Accuracy metric calculates the proportion of pixels correctly classified out of the total number of pixels in the image. It is mathematically represented as the ratio of the number of correctly classified pixels (Ncorrect) to the total number of pixels (Ntotal) multiplied by 100%.

On the other hand, the Kappa Coefficient considers the chance agreement between classification and observations. It quantifies how much the classification accuracy surpasses random agreement. The Kappa Coefficient is calculated using the formula where Po is the ratio of agreed pixels to the total number of pixels, and Pe is the expected probability of agreement, determined as the product of the sum of class proportions by rows and columns.
