The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, scaling, etc. However, it can be inferred from the common practices in deep learning pipelines that some form of data augmentation might have been employed. Data augmentation is often used to increase the size of the dataset and prevent overfitting by applying various transformations to the existing images. Given that the authors mentioned preventing overfitting and using a large number of images (900,000), it is likely that they utilized some form of data augmentation. Unfortunately, without explicit information about the exact techniques used, we cannot provide a definitive list of data augmentation methods applied in this study.
