Based on the given context, various methods are used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. These include using satellite imagery such as Sentinel-2 data, which is mentioned in the context. Additionally, hyperspectral imaging technology is also employed for agricultural applications, as indicated by Khan et al. (2022). Gitelson et al. (2002) discuss the use of remote sensing techniques for estimating vegetation fraction. Furthermore, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are utilized for extracting vegetation and estimating above-ground biomass, as demonstrated by Yin et al. (2020) and Yue et al. (2019). Public datasets may also be used as sources of raw data, although this is not explicitly stated in the provided context. Surveys or other forms of direct data collection do not appear to be discussed within the given context.
