The hyperparameters of the Random Forest (RF) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models are optimized using Optuna 2.10.0, which is a library designed for automated hyperparameter optimization. This process involves selecting the best combination of hyperparameters from a set of possible choices to improve the performance of the machine learning algorithm. The specific parameters and their respective ranges considered during this optimization process are listed in Table 1 within the provided context.

For the LightGBM models, the authors utilized Optuna's LightGBM Tuner, which is specifically tailored for tuning the hyperparameters of LightGBM models. This approach ensures that the optimal settings are chosen for these particular types of models.

In summary, the hyperparameters of the RF and ANN models are optimized using Optuna, while those of the LightGBM models are fine-tuned through Optuna's LightGBM Tuner. Both methods aim to find the most suitable hyperparameters for improving the performance of the corresponding machine learning algorithms.
