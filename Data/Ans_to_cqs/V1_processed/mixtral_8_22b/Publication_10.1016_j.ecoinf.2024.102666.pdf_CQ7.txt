The context does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into sets such as train, test, or validation. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to divide datasets into these categories. Typically, a larger portion of the dataset is allocated for training (e.g., around 70-80%), while smaller portions are reserved for testing (e.g., 10-15%) and validation (e.g., 10-15%). These proportions can vary depending on factors like the size of the dataset and the complexity of the problem being addressed. In some cases, additional techniques like cross-validation may be employed to further improve the robustness and generalizability of the trained models.
