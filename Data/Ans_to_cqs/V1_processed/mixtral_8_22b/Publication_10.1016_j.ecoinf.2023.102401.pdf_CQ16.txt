Training is determined to be complete when a satisfactory level of performance is achieved. This is evaluated by validating the trained model against test images and computing metrics such as accuracy, recall, F1 score, and other relevant measures. Based on the evaluation results, adjustments can be made to the parameters and structure of the model to improve its detection performance. This process is iterated until the desired level of performance is reached. In simpler terms, training continues until the model performs well enough according to the chosen metrics, which may include a validation loss plateau or reaching a specific threshold for accuracy or another metric.
