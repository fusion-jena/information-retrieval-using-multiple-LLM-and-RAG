Training completion is determined based on the validation loss not improving for a certain number of epochs. In this case, the learning rate is automatically reduced by a factor of 0.1 when the validation loss has not improved for 15 consecutive epochs. This indicates that the model might be stuck in a local minimum or unable to learn further from the training data. However, it does not necessarily imply that training should stop completely. It may still be beneficial to continue training with a lower learning rate to fine-tune the model and potentially achieve better performance.
