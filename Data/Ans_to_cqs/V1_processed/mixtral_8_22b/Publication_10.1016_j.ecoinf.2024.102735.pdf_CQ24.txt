Based on the given context, it appears that one strategy employed to handle randomness in the machine learning pipeline is through utilizing optimized models developed via randomized subsets of training data. This approach helps to generate prediction distributions, which can then be used to estimate the amount of uncertainty covered for every instant prediction made by each model. However, the context does not provide specific information about handling randomness related to deep learning pipelines or random seed values. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed response regarding those aspects.
