Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, the text does indicate that the study employs the AlexNet architecture, which is known for its use of practical strategies like ReLU nonlinear layers and dropout regularization techniques. These strategies can be considered part of the optimization process in deep learning pipelines. Dropout regularization helps prevent overfitting during training, while ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) serves as an activation function that introduces nonlinearity into the model, enabling it to learn from complex datasets. Although not explicitly mentioned, these optimization techniques contribute to the effectiveness of the AlexNet model in handling small-sized inputs and complex problems with ease.
