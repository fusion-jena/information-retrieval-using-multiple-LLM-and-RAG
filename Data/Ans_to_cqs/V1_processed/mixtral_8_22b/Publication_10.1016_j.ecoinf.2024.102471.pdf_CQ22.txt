The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made by the model. It is calculated as the ratio of true positives (TP) to the sum of true positives and false positives (FP). Recall, on the other hand, measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances. It is calculated as the ratio of true positives (TP) to the sum of true positives and false negatives (FN). The F1-score is a harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both measures. These metrics are used to calculate the performance of the proposed Wav2Vec model for classifying overlapping bird call audio from a test dataset. Two baseline techniques, namely hybrid CNN-LSTM and attention-based hybrid CNN-LSTM, were also used for performance comparison.
