Field data were collected during the summer season in 2010. The presence or absence and the cover percentage of the three seagrass species were recorded for each sampling point, by means of inspection and sampling of the seabed. Points not falling within the region of interest (ROI) and mixed points where multiple species co-occurred were removed from the dataset. This suggests that the raw data collection involved manual inspection and sampling of the seabed, followed by filtering out irrelevant or mixed data points. However, specific survey techniques, sensor types, or use of public datasets are not explicitly mentioned in this context.
