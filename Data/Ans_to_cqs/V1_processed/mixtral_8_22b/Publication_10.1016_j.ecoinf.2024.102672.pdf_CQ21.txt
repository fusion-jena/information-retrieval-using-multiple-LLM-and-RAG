After the model training, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the project. Based on the given context, here are some possible postprocessing steps:

1. Model Evaluation: After training the model, evaluating its performance using appropriate metrics is essential. In this case, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Percentile P50 loss curves, and confusion matrices have been used to evaluate the performance of the classification and regression models.

2. Hyperparameter Tuning: To improve the model's performance further, hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, number of layers, and neurons can be tuned. This involves selecting different combinations of hyperparameters and observing their impact on the model's performance.

3. Visualization: Visualizing the results of the trained model can help understand how well it performs. For example, Fig. 6 shows real and predicted values of thermocline presence with the optimal classification model. Similarly, other visualizations like saliency maps can also be generated to highlight important features contributing to the model's predictions.

4. Interpretation: Once the model has been evaluated and validated, interpreting its results is crucial. It helps explain why certain decisions were made by the model and provides insights into the underlying patterns in the data.

In summary, postprocessing steps after model training include evaluating the model's performance using relevant metrics, fine-tuning hyperparameters, generating visualizations, and interpreting the results. These steps ensure that the model meets the desired objectives and provides valuable insights into the problem being addressed.
