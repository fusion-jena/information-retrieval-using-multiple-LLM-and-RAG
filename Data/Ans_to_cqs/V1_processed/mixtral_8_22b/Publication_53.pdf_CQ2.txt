The deep learning pipeline described in the given context uses image data format. This is evident from the statement where it mentions that they have taken a sample of 400 images out of the total 7362 downloaded images for labeling. Furthermore, the use of a pre-trained ResNet34 model, which is designed for image classification tasks, confirms this. Additionally, the mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping vertically, limiting lighting, disabling zooming, etc., are typically applied to image datasets. Hence, the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is image data.
