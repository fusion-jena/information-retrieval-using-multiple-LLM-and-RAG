The authors do not explicitly discuss strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some common practices include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using techniques like cross-validation to reduce variance, and employing ensemble methods to average out the effects of random initialization. It should also be noted that while randomness can introduce variability, it can sometimes help prevent overfitting and improve generalization.

Based on the given context, we cannot provide specific details about how the authors handled randomness in their deep learning pipeline. Therefore, the helpful answer provides general strategies often employed to manage randomness in deep learning pipelines.
