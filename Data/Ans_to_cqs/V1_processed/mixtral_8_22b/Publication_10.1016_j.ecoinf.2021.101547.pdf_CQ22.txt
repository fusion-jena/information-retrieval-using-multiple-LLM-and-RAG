Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall. However, it does discuss the concept of 'loss', which is a common metric used during the training phase of deep learning models. Loss measures the difference between predicted values and actual values, and it helps guide the optimization process to minimize this discrepancy. In the context provided, loss is computed based on the difference between estimated class probabilities and actual class labels. While loss is crucial for training, other metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall are typically used to assess the overall performance of the trained model on unseen test data. Accuracy refers to the proportion of correct predictions out of total predictions made; precision measures how many true positives there are among all positive predictions; and recall indicates the ratio of true positives identified correctly to the total number of actual positives. These metrics help quantify the effectiveness of the model in handling both false negatives and false positives.
