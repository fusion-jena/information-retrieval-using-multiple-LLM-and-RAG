Based on the given context, it appears that the key hyperparameters mentioned for the deep learning model are related to the structure of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network rather than specific parameters like learning rate or optimizer. These structural hyperparameters include:

1. Number of hidden layers: This hyperparameter determines the depth of the LSTM network. It plays a significant role in the network's ability to learn from data and capture complex patterns. In this case, the range for the number of hidden layers is specified between 1 and 3, based on initial tests.

However, without additional information, we cannot provide details about other common hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, epoch count, or choice of optimizer. These parameters can significantly impact the training process and overall performance of the deep learning model.
