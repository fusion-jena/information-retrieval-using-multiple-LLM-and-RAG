Based on the given context, there is no explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention some techniques used during the model building process such as Local Response Normalization (LRN), Dropout, Maximum Pooling, and Convolution Layers.

Typically, after training a deep learning model like the one described here, common postprocessing steps might include generating saliency maps to visualize important regions in input images, calculating metrics such as accuracy or loss to evaluate the performance of the model, and creating confusion matrices to understand misclassifications made by the model. But without further details about the specific task or application of this model, it's not possible to provide a definitive list of postprocessing steps.
