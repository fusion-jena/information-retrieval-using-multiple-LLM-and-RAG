The text does not provide explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of optical imagery datasets organized into large-scale temporal habitat maps, suggesting that remote sensing or underwater photography might be employed for gathering such data. Additionally, the paper discusses the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) architectures for automatically labeling deep-sea images, implying that visual data is being processed in this case. Nevertheless, without further details, it cannot be confirmed whether other types of sensors or survey methods were also utilized during the data collection process.
