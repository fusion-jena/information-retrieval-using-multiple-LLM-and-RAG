Based on the given context, it appears that the data has been split into two sets: a train split and a test split. However, the specific criteria or methodology used to perform this split is not explicitly mentioned in the provided information. Typically, data splitting involves dividing the available data into separate subsets, often referred to as training, testing, and sometimes validation datasets. This division can be done randomly or based on certain criteria such as time periods, geographical locations, or other relevant factors depending on the nature of the problem being addressed. Common practices include using around 70-80% of the data for training, while reserving the remaining portion for testing and/or validation purposes. Without further details about the specific project or additional context, it is difficult to provide a more precise answer regarding the exact criteria used for splitting the data in this case.
