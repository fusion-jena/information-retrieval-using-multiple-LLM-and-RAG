The text does not provide explicit information about the specific evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the best performing model was selected based on the validation loss after training for 3000 iterations. Additionally, Table 9 presents Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values for different methods, including Faster R-CNN and YOLOv5s. These error metrics can be used to measure the difference between predicted and actual values, providing insights into the model's performance. Nevertheless, without further context, it cannot be determined if additional evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score were employed.
