In the given context, it is mentioned that the hyperparameters evaluated iteratively were network capacity (number of layers and neurons per layer), applied regularization techniques, as well as the used loss function and optimizer. However, specific values or types of these hyperparameters are not explicitly stated. Therefore, while we can infer that the learning rate might have been included within the optimization process, its exact value remains unknown based on the provided information. Similarly, the type of optimizer used could be one of several possibilities, including stochastic gradient descent, Adam, RMSprop, etc., but the context does not specify which one was chosen. In conclusion, although we know some of the hyperparameters considered during the evaluation, the precise values or types remain undisclosed in this context.
