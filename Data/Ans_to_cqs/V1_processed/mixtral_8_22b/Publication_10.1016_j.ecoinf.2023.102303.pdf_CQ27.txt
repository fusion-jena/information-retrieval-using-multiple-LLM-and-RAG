Unfortunately, the given context does not explicitly mention the specific process or steps followed to deploy the trained deep learning models. However, based on common practices in machine learning projects, after training the models, they would typically go through some form of evaluation and validation before being deployed. Once ready for deployment, the models could be serialized into a format suitable for the target platform, such as ONNX or TensorFlow Lite. Depending on the use case, these models might be integrated with existing software or hosted on cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure. Without further information, I cannot provide more details about the exact process followed in this particular project.
