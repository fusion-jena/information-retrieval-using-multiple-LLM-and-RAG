Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotation, scaling, or others applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide some general insights about these techniques. Data augmentation is often employed to increase the size of the dataset by applying random transformations to existing images, which helps improve the performance and robustness of deep learning models. Commonly used data augmentation techniques include horizontal and vertical flips, rotations, scaling, cropping, zooming, shearing, and brightness adjustment. In this study, the authors chose to use a ResNet-50 model for feature extraction, but without further details regarding the implementation of data augmentation techniques, it cannot be determined if any were utilized.
