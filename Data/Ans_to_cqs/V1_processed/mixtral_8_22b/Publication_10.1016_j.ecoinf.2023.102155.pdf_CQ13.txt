Based on the given context, it appears there is no mention of any deep learning model or its associated hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer. Instead, the context discusses the usage of the `ppmlasso` package and its functions like `sp.scale`, `cov.bias`, `kVal`, and `n.fits`. These parameters seem to be related to spatial resolution, observer bias, and the number of models to fit along the regularization path. Additionally, the text mentions using the `ppmlassoMixEngine` and `ppmlassoLoopEngine` functions but does not provide details about their implementation or any specific hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information regarding the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model based on the available context.
