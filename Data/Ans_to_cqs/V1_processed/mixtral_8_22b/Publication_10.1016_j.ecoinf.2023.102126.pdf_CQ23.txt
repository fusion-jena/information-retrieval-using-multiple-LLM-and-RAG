Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide a specific answer regarding the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, I can discuss some common methods used to improve the generalizability of deep learning models.

One approach is to use diverse datasets during training. A diverse dataset should include various examples representing different scenarios or conditions that the model might encounter when deployed. By exposing the model to a wide range of situations, it becomes better equipped to handle new, unseen data.

Cross-validation is another technique used to evaluate the performance of a model and enhance its generalization capabilities. It involves dividing the dataset into multiple subsets called folds. Each fold serves as a validation set once while the remaining folds form the training set. This process is repeated until every fold has served as the validation set. Cross-validation helps prevent overfitting and provides a more accurate estimate of how well the model will perform on unseen data.

Stratified splitting is a strategy used to maintain class distribution when partitioning the dataset into training and test sets. Instead of randomly assigning instances to either set, stratification ensures that both sets contain roughly the same proportion of samples from each class. This approach is particularly beneficial when dealing with imbalanced datasets, where one class significantly outnumbers others.

Again, without additional details about the specific deep learning model being discussed, these techniques serve as potential ways to improve the generalizability of any given model.
