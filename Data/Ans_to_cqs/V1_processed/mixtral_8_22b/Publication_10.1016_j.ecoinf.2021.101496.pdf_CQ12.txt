The text does not explicitly mention the use of a deep learning model in the pipeline. Instead, it describes the implementation of an artificial neural network (ANN) for modeling SPAD values. An ANN is a machine learning algorithm inspired by biological neural networks and is often used for tasks such as regression or classification. However, unlike deep learning models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), or transformers, traditional ANNs typically have fewer layers and are not necessarily designed for processing large amounts of data or extracting hierarchical features. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot determine which specific type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline, as there is no explicit mention of a deep learning model being employed.
