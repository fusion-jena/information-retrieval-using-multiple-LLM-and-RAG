The given context does not provide information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, it mentions that the productivity models were trained using the random forest algorithm and the R package "ranger" (Wright and Ziegler, 2017). The text also discusses the benefits of machine learning in ecology, such as improved accuracy and the ability to handle non-linear relationships and multiple predictors. It lists various applications of machine learning in ecology, including species distribution, species identification, characterization of land use change, biodiversity conservation, and invasive species risk assessment. Unfortunately, there is no mention of the specific steps taken to deploy the trained models, such as model serialization or platform selection.
