Based on the given context, the deep learning pipeline primarily uses audio data. Specifically, the audio classification loss network is trained using different background noises and classes of associated sounds combined with a preset acoustic scene classification task and an audio labeling task. The relevant training dataset is derived from a study by Mesaros et al. (2018). Therefore, it can be concluded that the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is audio data.
