The given context does not provide information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, common criteria used to determine when training is complete include a validation loss plateau, where the validation loss stops decreasing significantly after several epochs; early stopping, which involves monitoring the validation loss and stopping the training process if it starts increasing again; and reaching a predefined number of epochs or iterations. These criteria help prevent overfitting and ensure that the model generalizes well to new data.
