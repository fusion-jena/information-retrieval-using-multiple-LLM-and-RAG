The information provided does not mention any specific data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the research. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It would be best to refer to the original sources or contact the authors directly for more detailed information about their data repository.

Based on the given context, it appears that the research focuses on ecology and wildlife conservation, specifically involving Amur tigers and leopards in China. The cited papers discuss topics such as landscape conservation plans, tiger recovery in China, and effects of trapping efforts on estimating tiger abundance. However, none of these references explicitly mentions a deep learning pipeline or its associated data repository.
