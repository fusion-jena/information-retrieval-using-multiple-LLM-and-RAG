Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available from the given context to determine which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. The text only mentions the use of the R package 'kohonen' for implementing the Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM) neural network but does not specify any details about the deployment environment or cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. Therefore, it is impossible to accurately state which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model based solely on the provided context.
