None of the provided sources directly address the issue of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some general strategies can be applied to manage this aspect. One common approach is to set a fixed random seed value before training the deep learning model. This ensures reproducibility by making sure that the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers is generated every time the code is executed. Another strategy involves performing multiple runs or iterations of the model with different random seeds and then averaging the results. This helps reduce the impact of any single random initialization and provides more robust outcomes. Lastly, techniques like cross-validation and bootstrapping can also help mitigate the effects of randomness in the dataset itself.
