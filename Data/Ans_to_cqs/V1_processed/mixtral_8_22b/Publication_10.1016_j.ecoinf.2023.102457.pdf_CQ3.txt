The text does not explicitly mention any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does discuss the use of pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs), including BirdNET, VGGish, and Wav2Vec 2.0, for feature extraction and classification tasks. These models have been trained on various audio datasets, including bird vocalizations, YouTube audio, and human speech audio.

In terms of data annotation, the text briefly mentions that self-supervised auto-encoders have been used to classify unlabeled data on seven different datasets of vocalizing species, providing results closely matching expert annotations. While this technique is not directly comparable to traditional image annotation methods like bounding boxes or instance segmentation, it demonstrates the potential for automated labeling and annotation of large datasets of vocalizations.

Overall, while the text does not focus specifically on data annotation techniques within the deep learning pipeline, it highlights the importance of leveraging pre-trained models and developing domain-specific embeddings for improved feature extraction and classification in the field of passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) for wildlife conservation.
