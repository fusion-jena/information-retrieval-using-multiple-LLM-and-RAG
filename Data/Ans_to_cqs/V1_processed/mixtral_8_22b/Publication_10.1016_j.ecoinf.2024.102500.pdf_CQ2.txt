The given context does not provide information about the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the researchers utilized machine learning models to analyze and predict water quality parameters such as conductivity, BOD, nitrate, and DO. Therefore, we can infer that the data format used is likely to be structured data, possibly in CSV or similar tabular format, containing numerical values representing these water quality parameters. The context also mentions the use of libraries like Lazy Predict, which supports various machine learning models, further suggesting the use of structured data. Without additional context, we cannot confirm if other data formats like images, audio, or video were used in the deep learning pipeline.
