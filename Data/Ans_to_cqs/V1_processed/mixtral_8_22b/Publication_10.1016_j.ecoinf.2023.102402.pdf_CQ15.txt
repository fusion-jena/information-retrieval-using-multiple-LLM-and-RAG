The given context does not provide information on the specific optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it discusses the use of Maximum Entropy (Maxent) models and their evaluation using Akaike Information Criteria corrected for small sample sizes (AICc), which is a method for selecting the most parsimonious model among several candidates. In this case, the model with the lowest AICc value is considered the best model, and those with Î”AICc < 2 are also supported. This approach helps to avoid overfitting and improve the generalization ability of the model.
