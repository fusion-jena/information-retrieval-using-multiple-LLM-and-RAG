The text does not provide information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete for creating fire risk maps using Landsat 8 imagery and vegetation indices. However, common criteria used in machine learning models include reaching a minimum threshold for validation loss or accuracy, achieving a stable performance over several epochs, or observing no further improvement in model performance after a certain number of iterations. In this case, it can be assumed that similar criteria were applied during the creation of the fire risk maps.

Based on the table provided, it appears that the authors used various parameters from Landsat 8 satellite images, including sensor type, path/row, acquisition date, cloud cover percentage, band name, central wavelength, and spatial resolution. These parameters likely played a role in determining the quality and suitability of the images for use in creating fire risk maps. Additionally, the authors mention performing atmospheric correction on the images before proceeding with their analysis, which suggests that they took steps to ensure the accuracy and reliability of their results.

Overall, while the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete are not explicitly stated in the provided context, it can be inferred that the authors followed best practices for ensuring the validity and robustness of their fire risk map creation process.
