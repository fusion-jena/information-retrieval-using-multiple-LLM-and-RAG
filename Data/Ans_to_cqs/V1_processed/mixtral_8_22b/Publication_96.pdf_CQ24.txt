Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, specifically regarding random seed values. However, some common strategies to manage randomness in deep learning pipelines include:

1. Fixed Random Seeds: Setting fixed random seeds ensures consistent results across multiple runs or experiments. This helps in reproducing results and debugging code.

2. Cross-Validation: Using cross-validation techniques like k-fold cross-validation can help reduce the impact of randomness due to data splitting. By averaging the performance over several splits, more robust estimates of model performance can be obtained.

3. Ensemble Methods: Combining multiple models trained with different initializations or hyperparameters can improve generalization and mitigate the effects of randomness. Techniques like bagging, boosting, and stacking can be used to create ensembles.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning: Performing systematic hyperparameter tuning, e.g., grid search or random search, can help find optimal configurations that minimize the impact of random initialization.

In summary, while the given context does not provide direct answers related to managing randomness in deep learning pipelines, commonly adopted strategies include setting fixed random seeds, employing cross-validation techniques, utilizing ensemble methods, and performing thorough hyperparameter tuning.
