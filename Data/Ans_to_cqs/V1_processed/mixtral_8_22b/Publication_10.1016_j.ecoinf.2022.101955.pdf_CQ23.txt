The study does not provide explicit information regarding specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that some steps might have been taken implicitly. For instance, the use of diverse datasets could contribute to better generalizability. In this case, the authors mention using over 3000 training samples randomly selected for training purposes under default settings. This suggests that they employed a diverse dataset to train their models. Additionally, while not explicitly mentioned, cross-validation or stratified splitting techniques may have been applied during the model development process. These are common practices in machine learning to improve model robustness and prevent overfitting, which ultimately contributes to better generalizability. Nevertheless, without clear evidence from the given text, one cannot definitively state whether such techniques were utilized.
