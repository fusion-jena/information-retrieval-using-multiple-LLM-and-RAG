Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to determine the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context. However, based on the general description of the problem - reconstructing caesium-137 chronic particulate concentrations in rivers - it can be assumed that the dataset would likely consist of historical environmental data related to river systems, including measurements of caesium-137 levels, along with other relevant factors like weather conditions, water quality parameters, etc. Additionally, since the model being evaluated is an encoder-decoder neural network called Hierarchical Attention-Based Recurrent Highway Networks (HRHN), it suggests that the input data might have some form of sequential or temporal structure, making it suitable for processing by recurrent networks.
