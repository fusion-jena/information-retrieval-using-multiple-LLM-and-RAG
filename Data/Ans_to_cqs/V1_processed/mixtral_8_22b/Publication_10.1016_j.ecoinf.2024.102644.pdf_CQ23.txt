The text does not provide explicit information about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the model was trained using a diverse dataset obtained from large-scale repositories such as GBIF and OBIS, which contain millions of records regarding species' observations across multiple decades. This suggests that the dataset used for training the model was likely diverse in terms of both temporal and spatial coverage. Additionally, the mention of potential sampling biases due to varying sampling efforts and paths over time and space indicates awareness of the need to address issues related to data quality and representativeness when developing predictive models. While the text does not explicitly discuss techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting, these methods are commonly employed to improve the robustness and generalizability of machine learning models. Therefore, it can be assumed that similar approaches may have been applied in this case, although further details would be needed to confirm this.
