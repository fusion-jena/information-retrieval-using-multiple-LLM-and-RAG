To improve the performance of the model and prevent overfitting, several data augmentation techniques were applied in the deep learning pipeline. These included horizontal flipping, rotation, scaling, shearing, and translation. Horizontal flipping involves reflecting the image along its vertical axis, which helps the model generalize better to different orientations. Rotation involves rotating the image by a certain degree, which helps the model recognize objects regardless of their orientation. Scaling involves resizing the image, which helps the model handle variations in object sizes. Shearing involves skewing the image along one of its axes, which helps the model recognize distorted objects. Translation involves shifting the image along one of its axes, which helps the model locate objects within the image. All these techniques help increase the diversity of the training data and improve the robustness of the model.
