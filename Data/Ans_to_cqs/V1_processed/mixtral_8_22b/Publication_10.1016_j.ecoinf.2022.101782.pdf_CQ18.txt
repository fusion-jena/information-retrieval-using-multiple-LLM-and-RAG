The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves tracking both the training loss and accuracy, as well as the validation loss and accuracy. The best model is then selected based on the minimal validation loss observed throughout the training process. In this particular scenario, the best model was chosen when the minimum validation loss occurred at epoch 448. At this point, the model demonstrated a training loss of 0.256, a training accuracy of 0.899, a validation loss of 0.298, and a validation accuracy of 0.891.
