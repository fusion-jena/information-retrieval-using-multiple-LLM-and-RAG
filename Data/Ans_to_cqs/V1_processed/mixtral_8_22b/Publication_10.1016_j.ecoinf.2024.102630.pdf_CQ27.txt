The given context does not provide any information about the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer based on the available information.

Based on general practices, after training a deep learning model, it is typically serialized or saved for later use. Serialization involves converting the model into a format that can be stored and loaded efficiently. Once the model is serialized, it can be deployed on various platforms such as web servers, mobile devices, or edge computing devices depending on the application requirements. However, without specific details regarding the model used in this study, I am unable to provide more detailed information about its deployment process.
