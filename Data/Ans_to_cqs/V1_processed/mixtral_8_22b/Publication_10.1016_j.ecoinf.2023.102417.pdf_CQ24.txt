The provided context does not directly address the issue of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, including the use of random seed values. However, I can provide some general information about how randomness is typically handled in deep learning pipelines.

Randomness in deep learning pipelines often arises from various sources, such as weight initialization, shuffling of training data, dropout regularization, and stochastic gradient descent optimization algorithms. Random seeds are commonly used to control these sources of randomness, ensuring reproducibility and consistency between experiments.

To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed:

1. Fixed random seed: By setting a fixed random seed value, you ensure that all random processes within the pipeline generate the same sequence of numbers each time they are executed. This helps maintain consistency and reproducibility across multiple runs of the same experiment.

2. Multiple runs with different seeds: Since using a single random seed may lead to overfitting or underestimation of performance variability, researchers often perform multiple runs of their experiments with different random seed values. Averaging results across these runs can help obtain more robust estimates of model performance.

3. Seed sweeping: In this approach, instead of fixing a single random seed, you run your experiments with a range of different seed values. This technique can help identify whether the observed performance is sensitive to the choice of random seed.

4. Deterministic algorithms: Some operations in the deep learning pipeline, such as sorting or matrix multiplication, have deterministic alternatives that do not rely on random number generation. Using these deterministic versions can reduce the overall randomness in the pipeline.
