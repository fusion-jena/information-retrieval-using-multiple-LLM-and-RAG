In the given context, the method utilized for collecting raw data is remote sensing. Specifically, the study uses three types of remote sensing data: GF-1 optical imagery, GF-3 SAR imagery, and MODIS NDVI imagery. The GF-1 images are multispectral images captured with a wide-format WFV camera, having four bands of blue, green, red, and near-infrared with a spatial resolution of 16 meters. These images were retrieved from the China Centre for Resources Satellite Data and Application. The GF-3 SAR imagery and MODIS NDVI imagery are not explicitly described in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that these are also remotely sensed data, likely collected using satellite or airborne sensors. Therefore, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in this deep learning pipeline are remote sensing techniques, specifically satellite or airborne sensors capturing optical and SAR imagery, and vegetation indices like NDVI.
