Based on the given context, there is no information about the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model, such as accuracy, precision, or recall. Instead, the text discusses the results of the FAIR assessment of datasets selected by the F-UJI tool, which uses 16 metrics established in the FAIRsFAIR project. These metrics are distributed among four principles and are used to analyze groups of repositories. The results are then compiled into a computational notebook report, which generates visualizations of the summaries of each FAIR principle for all eight repositories. However, these metrics do not directly relate to the performance evaluation of a deep learning model.
