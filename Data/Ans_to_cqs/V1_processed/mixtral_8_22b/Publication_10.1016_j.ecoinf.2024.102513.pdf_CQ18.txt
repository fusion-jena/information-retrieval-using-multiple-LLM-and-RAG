The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves dividing the dataset for each period into training, testing, and validation sets in a ratio of 70:20:10, respectively. This division allows for the evaluation of the model's performance on unseen data, ensuring its ability to generalize well to new inputs. Additionally, the classification accuracy was calculated for each model trained on the corresponding period using the sklearn library. These measures help ensure the reliability and robustness of the models developed.
