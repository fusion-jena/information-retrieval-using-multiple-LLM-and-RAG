The text does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, it mentions that two optimization techniques were used during the training phase. These techniques could include methods such as grid search or random search, but without further details, it is impossible to determine which specific method was employed. Therefore, the exact technique used for hyperparameter optimization remains unknown based on the given context.
