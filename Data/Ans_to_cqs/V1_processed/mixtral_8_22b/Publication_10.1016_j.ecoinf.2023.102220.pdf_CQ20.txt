The given context does not mention any specific details about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which hardware resources were utilized for training the deep neural networks or other machine learning algorithms mentioned in the text.

Based on the information available, one can only infer that the authors likely used some form of computational resource capable of running Python code and supporting the required libraries, including TensorFlow and Scikit-learn. However, without explicit reference to GPU, TPU, CPU, or other hardware components, it remains uncertain what type of processing power was employed during the development and evaluation of these machine learning techniques.
