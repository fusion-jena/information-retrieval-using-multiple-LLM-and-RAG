After the model training, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the task. Some common postprocessing steps include saliency maps, metrics calculation, confusion matrix, etc.

Saliency maps help visualize which parts of the input data were most important for the model's decision making process. They highlight areas of the input data that contributed significantly towards the final prediction made by the model. This helps understand how the model arrived at its output and provides insights into potential biases or errors in the model's reasoning.

Metrics calculation involves evaluating the performance of the trained model using various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, etc. These metrics provide quantitative feedback about the quality of predictions made by the model and help identify any weaknesses or limitations in the model's performance.

Confusion matrix is another useful tool for analyzing the performance of a classification model. It summarizes the predicted and actual class labels for each instance in the test set, allowing us to see where the model has made mistakes and what types of misclassifications it tends to make. By examining the confusion matrix, we can gain valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of our model and use this information to improve its performance further.
