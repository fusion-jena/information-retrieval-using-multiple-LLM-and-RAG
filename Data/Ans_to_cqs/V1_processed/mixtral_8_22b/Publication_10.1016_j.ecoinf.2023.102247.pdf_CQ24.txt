The authors do not directly address handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or setting specific random seed values. However, they use ensemble modeling techniques to improve prediction accuracy by combining multiple machine learning algorithms. This can help reduce variability caused by random factors such as initial weights or biases in neural networks. Additionally, they employ cross-validation with separate training and testing datasets to evaluate their models, which also helps mitigate the impact of randomness on results.

Unhelpful 
The article does not provide information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or setting specific random seed values. Therefore, it is impossible to determine what strategies were employed to manage these aspects.
