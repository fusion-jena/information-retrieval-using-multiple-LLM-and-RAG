The text does not explicitly mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does state that the model's performance is evaluated using an overall performance metric that considers the correlation, variability, and bias of the model. This suggests that the evaluation may include metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), or similar measures that assess these aspects of the model's predictions. It also mentions that a learning rate of 0.0001 is used during training, which could indicate the use of some form of gradient descent optimization algorithm. Additionally, the text notes that the dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets, suggesting that cross-validation techniques might be employed to further evaluate the model's performance.
