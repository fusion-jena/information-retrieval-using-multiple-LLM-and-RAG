The text does not provide explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the collection and annotation of data for training models is labor-intensive, suggesting that manual processes like surveys or expert labeling might be involved. Additionally, the authors discuss generating synthetic samples from existing annotated datasets using techniques like generative adversarial models. While these details do not directly address the query regarding data collection methods, they imply that both manually labeled data and publicly available datasets could potentially be used in the deep learning pipeline.
