The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. However, it does provide information about the implementation time of the model being 23.1 minutes on the same machine used in previous models. Without further details, we cannot determine the exact hardware resources used for training the deep learning model.
