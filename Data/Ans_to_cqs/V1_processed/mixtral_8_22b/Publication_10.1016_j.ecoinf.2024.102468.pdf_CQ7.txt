Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training such as train, test, and validation sets. However, it can be inferred that the data was divided into training and testing datasets based on the statement "Subsequently, the feature vectors extracted from the test datasets are updated using the trained Gaussian parameters to produce refined feature vectors." Additionally, during the training stage, the extracted feature vectors were used to estimate important parameters including the start probability, transition matrix, and parameters of the Gaussian emission distribution. These parameters were then used to represent the obtained feature vector from the sound signal as a sequence of states over time. Therefore, it can be assumed that the data was likely split into training and testing datasets, but the exact criteria used for this division are not specified in the provided context.
