Unfortunately, there isn't any information provided about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some common techniques used to handle data bias include stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified sampling involves dividing the dataset into strata based on certain characteristics and then randomly selecting samples from each stratum. Oversampling increases the representation of minority classes by duplicating examples from these classes, while undersampling reduces the representation of majority classes by removing examples from them. Diverse data collection aims to gather data from various sources and demographics to ensure fair representation across all groups.
