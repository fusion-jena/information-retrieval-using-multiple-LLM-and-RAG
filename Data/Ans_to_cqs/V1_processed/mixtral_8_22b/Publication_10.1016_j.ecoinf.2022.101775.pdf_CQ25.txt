The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, based on the provided information, we can infer that the deep learning model is used for signal reconstruction or imputation. This is suggested by the mention of recovering corrupted data in sensor networks and improving the quality of imputations. Additionally, the use of embedding layers indicates that the model might be applied to natural language processing or collaborative filtering tasks. The optimization of a regularized cost function using stochastic gradient descent also suggests that the model could be used for regression or prediction tasks. Nonetheless, without more specific details about the intended application or output of the model, it is difficult to definitively determine its exact purpose.
