The purpose of the deep learning model used in this study is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, it can be inferred from the information provided that the model is likely being used for image classification tasks. The use of spectral bands, vegetation indices, soil indices, water indices, clusters, and their combinations as input datasets suggests that the goal is to classify land cover types or land use categories. Furthermore, the mention of the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, which is commonly used for supervised classification tasks, supports this assumption. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model is most likely employed for the classification of satellite imagery to generate Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) maps.
