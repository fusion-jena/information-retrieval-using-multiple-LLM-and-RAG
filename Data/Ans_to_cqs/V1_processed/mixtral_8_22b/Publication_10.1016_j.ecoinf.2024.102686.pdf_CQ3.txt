The paper does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this query based on the given context.

Based on general knowledge about deep learning pipelines, some common data annotation techniques include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and landmark annotation. These techniques help label various types of objects or regions within images, allowing machine learning models to learn patterns and relationships between input features and output labels.
