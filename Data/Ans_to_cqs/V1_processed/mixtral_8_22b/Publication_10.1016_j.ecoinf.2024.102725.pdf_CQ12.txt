Based on the given context, it is not explicitly stated what specific type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline. The context mentions that deep learning is applied for improving NDVI reconstruction and long-term vegetation cover studies, but does not provide details about the architecture of the deep learning model being utilized. Therefore, without additional information, we cannot determine whether a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Transformer, or another type of deep learning model is implemented in this particular scenario.
