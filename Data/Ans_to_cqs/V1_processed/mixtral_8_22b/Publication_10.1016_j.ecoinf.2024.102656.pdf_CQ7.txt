The context does not explicitly state the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it mentions that a 3:1 train-test split was employed for the occurrence points. This means that the dataset was divided into four parts, three of which were used for training the model and one part was used for testing its performance. It is common practice in machine learning to use such a split ratio when there is enough data available. The validation set is often created by further splitting the training set or using techniques like cross-validation. In this case, no explicit mention of a separate validation set is made, but it can be assumed that some form of validation was performed during the modeling process.
