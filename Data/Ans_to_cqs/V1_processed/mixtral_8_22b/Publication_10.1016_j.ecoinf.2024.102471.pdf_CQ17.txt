Regarding the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, the given context mentions diversity loss as a method used in the pre-training phase of the Wav2Vec model. Diversity loss is not a standard regularization technique such as dropout or L2 regularization, but rather a custom loss term introduced specifically for this model. This loss term encourages the model to produce diverse representations for different inputs, thus preventing overfitting and improving its ability to generalize to new data. However, the context does not provide details on how exactly this diversity loss is calculated or applied within the model.

As for standard regularization techniques, while the context does not explicitly mention them, they could still be employed in various stages of the deep learning pipeline. For instance, dropout could be used during both pre-training and fine-tuning phases to randomly ignore some neurons during training, effectively creating an ensemble of simpler networks and reducing overfitting. Similarly, L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, could be applied to penalize large weights and encourage smaller, more generalizable ones. These techniques would help improve the model's performance and robustness, even though they are not mentioned in the provided context.
