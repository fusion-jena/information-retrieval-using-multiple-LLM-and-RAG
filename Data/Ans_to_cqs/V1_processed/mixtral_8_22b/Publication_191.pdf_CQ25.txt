The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is not explicitly stated, however, based on the information given, it can be inferred that the deep learning models mentioned, such as AlexNet, VGGNet, GoogleNet, and ResNet, are used for image classification tasks. These models are employed to identify plant species by analyzing their leaves. The goal is to determine the optimal number of convolutional layers needed in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to achieve the best optimization ability in modeling plant data. Additionally, these models aim to discover which leaf features are most effective for plant species identification.
