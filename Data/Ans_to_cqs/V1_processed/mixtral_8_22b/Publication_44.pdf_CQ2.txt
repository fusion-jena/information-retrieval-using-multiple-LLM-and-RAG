The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the primary data format used is image data since the text discusses herbarium sheet images and mentions applying various image processing techniques like resizing, rotation, flipping, and brightness adjustments. Additionally, the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), specifically VGG16 and DeepLabv3+, further supports this assumption as these architectures are typically employed for image classification and semantic segmentation tasks. Therefore, based on the given information, it can be concluded that the main data format utilized in the deep learning pipeline is image data.
