The text does not explicitly mention a deep learning model but it discusses models and their evaluation metrics. The metrics mentioned for evaluating these models include Area Under Curve (AUC), True Positive Rate (TPR), True Skill Statistic (TSS), Omission rate, and Cohen's Kappa value. These metrics are used to assess various aspects of the model's performance such as its ability to distinguish between classes (AUC), its sensitivity or true positive rate (TPR), its overall skill (TSS), how well it avoids false negatives (Omission rate), and its agreement with observed data adjusted for chance (Cohen's Kappa value). However, there is no consensus on the best measure, so all these model statistics are presented to allow for comparison.
