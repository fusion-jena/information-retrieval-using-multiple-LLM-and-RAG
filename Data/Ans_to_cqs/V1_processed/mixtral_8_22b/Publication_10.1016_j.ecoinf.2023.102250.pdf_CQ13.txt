Unfortunately, the given context does not provide explicit information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model such as learning rate or optimizer. It only mentions that the hyperparameter settings were kept the same as in the previous model when replacing the original 3x3 static convolutional kernel in the classifier with a dynamic convolutional kernel. Therefore, I cannot provide the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model based on the given context.
