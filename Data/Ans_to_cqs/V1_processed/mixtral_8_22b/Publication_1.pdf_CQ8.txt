Unfortunately, there is no mention of where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available in the given piece of context. The paper only discusses the application of deep learning techniques for large scale biodiversity monitoring but does not provide any details about the implementation or availability of the code used in the study. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
