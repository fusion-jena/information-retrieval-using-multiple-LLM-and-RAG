The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves generating batches of training images randomly on the fly from source images. These source images are randomly cropped to a resolution of 256 x 256 and augmented. This approach ensures that the exact same image is never shown twice during training. The training data is generated as batches of size (m, 256, 256, 3), where m is the batch size (m = 20 in their experiments). The corresponding batches of mask data have a shape of (20, 256, 256, 1). The network training assessment is performed on sub-images generated from image #2 (Table 1). Images #4 and #6 are used for visualization and demonstration of the algorithm's efficacy.
