In the given context, there is mention of one dataset used in the deep learning pipeline - the ImageNet dataset. Specifically, a resnet-50 classification backbone was used, which had been pretrained on the ImageNet dataset. Other datasets mentioned in the references include the MNIST dataset and the CIFAR dataset, although they were not explicitly stated as being used in the deep learning pipeline described in the text. It should also be noted that the authors experimented with different architectures (resnet-101 and resnet-152), but did not find any improvement compared to the resnet-50 architecture.
