To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the model was trained on varying disjoint subsets of the dataset, corresponding to different time steps ranging from 5 to 25 days of flight activity recordings. This approach allowed for the assessment of the number of recordings required to achieve satisfactory classification metrics. Additionally, subsequent experiments included training the model with various combinations of datasets, including one, two, three, or all four datasets combined. This diversity in the dataset helped improve the model's ability to generalize across different scenarios. Furthermore, the dataset was divided into training and validation sets, with 70% of the data allocated for training and 30% for validation. This division was carried out through random selection, ensuring that the model could perform well on unseen data. Lastly, the model's weights were randomly initialized using a specific integer seed to guarantee consistent reproducibility of results. Overall, these measures aimed to enhance the robustness and reliability of the deep learning model by improving its capacity to generalize effectively.
