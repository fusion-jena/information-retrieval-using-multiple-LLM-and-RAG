The paper does not provide information on the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the authors use a balanced, open-access, global dataset of vegetation plots from Global Ecology and Biogeography. Additionally, they reference other studies that have used various datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet, but these are not explicitly mentioned as being used in their own work.
