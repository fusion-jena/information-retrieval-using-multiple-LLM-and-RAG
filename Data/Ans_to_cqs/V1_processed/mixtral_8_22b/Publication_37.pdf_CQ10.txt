Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to provide the exact code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. However, I can tell you that the authors mentioned they used Python and Lasagne library for implementing their convolutional neural network (CNN). They also mentioned using Pescador for data stream multiplexing during training. It would be best to search for related papers by the same authors or contact them directly to find out if they made their code publicly available.
