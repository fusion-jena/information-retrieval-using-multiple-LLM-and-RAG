Based on the given context, it is not possible to determine the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer that the study utilizes multiple sources of remote sensing data, including GF-1 optical imagery, GF-3 SAR imagery, and MODIS NDVI imagery. These datasets are likely used to train and test machine learning models, such as gradient boosting decision trees like LightGBM mentioned in one of the cited papers. It should be noted that these datasets are not standard benchmark datasets commonly used in computer vision tasks, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, they are specialized datasets tailored to the specific application of monitoring forested wetland hydrology and mapping multi-layered mangroves. Therefore, it would not be accurate to compare them directly to more general-purpose datasets like those listed in the query.
