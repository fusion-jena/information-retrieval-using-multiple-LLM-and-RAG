After the model training, there are several postprocessing steps that can be taken depending on the specific requirements of the task or application. Some common postprocessing steps include:

* Model evaluation: This involves evaluating the performance of the trained model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, etc. These metrics help to quantify how well the model performs on unseen data and provide insights into areas where the model may need improvement.
* Visualizing results: Visualizations such as confusion matrices, ROC curves, and saliency maps can help to understand the behavior of the model and identify any patterns or trends in the predictions.
* Hyperparameter tuning: After initial training, hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, etc. can be fine-tuned to improve the performance of the model further.
* Regularization techniques: Techniques such as dropout, L1/L2 regularization, and early stopping can be used to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization ability of the model.
* Ensemble methods: Multiple models can be combined to form an ensemble, which often provides better performance than individual models. Common ensemble methods include bagging, boosting, and stacking.

Based on the given context, it appears that the authors used a combination of these postprocessing steps. They evaluated their model using mean squared error (MSE) and determined the optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer and learning rate through a trial-and-error method. Additionally, they used an early stopping technique to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization ability of the model. However, the context does not explicitly mention other postprocessing steps such as visualizing results or hyperparameter tuning.
