The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. In this study, the authors use these four metrics to assess the performance of their proposed hierarchical classification model. They report the values of these metrics for both the validation and test sets. For example, they present the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for five different groups (G1 to G5) in Table 6. Additionally, they compare the performance of their proposed model with other models based on these metrics. From Fig. 6, it can be seen that the proposed model achieves high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score when compared to other models. Furthermore, the authors also provide a comparative analysis of the performance of their proposed model with respect to individual features such as geometric, multispectral, texture, shape, and convolution features. This analysis reveals that the proposed model with a fusion of convolution features with other machine learning features performs better than any single feature representation.
