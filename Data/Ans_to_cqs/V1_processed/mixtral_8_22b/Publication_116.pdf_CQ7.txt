In the deep learning experiment, the data is split into training and test subsets without any specific mention of a validation subset. The method used to divide the data is not explicitly stated; however, it can be inferred from the description of the first experiment that a similar approach might have been adopted. In the first experiment, the data was divided into a training and a test subset using a 70%-30% distribution, respectively. This distribution was approximated since it had to be attempted for each species in the dataset. Therefore, depending on the number of photos available for each species, the actual distribution could vary slightly. Additionally, the division was done at the photo level rather than the specimen level, meaning that some photos from the same specimen could end up in both the training and test subsets. This approach introduced a significant bias known as Same Specimen Per Bias (SSPB), which affected the performance of the models. Based on this information, it can be assumed that the deep learning experiment also employed a similar methodology for dividing the data, although the exact details remain unclear.
