To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed. One common approach is to use fixed random seeds when initializing weights or shuffling datasets. This ensures reproducibility across experiments and allows for better comparison of results. Another strategy is to perform multiple runs with different random seeds and average the results to reduce variability. Additionally, techniques such as dropout regularization and batch normalization can help mitigate the effects of random initialization and improve model performance. However, it should be noted that some level of randomness may still exist due to factors such as hardware variations and software implementations.

Based on the given context, there is no direct mention of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on using remote sensing data and machine learning algorithms for crop classification and chlorophyll content estimation. Nevertheless, the mentioned studies likely employ similar strategies to handle randomness in their respective pipelines. For instance, they might have used fixed random seeds for weight initialization or dataset shuffling to ensure reproducibility. They could also have performed multiple runs with different random seeds to account for variability. Furthermore, techniques like dropout regularization and batch normalization might have been utilized to enhance model performance and minimize the impact of random initialization.
