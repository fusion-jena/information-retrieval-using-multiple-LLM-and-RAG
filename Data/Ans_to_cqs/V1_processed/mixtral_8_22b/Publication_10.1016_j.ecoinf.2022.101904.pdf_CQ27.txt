The paper does not provide explicit information on the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, it mentions that the proposed method uses a combination of 3D UNet Generative Adversarial Network Swin Transformer (3DUNetGSFormer) for wetland training data synthesis. It also discusses various deep learning architectures like Vision Transformer (ViT), Swin Transformer, CoAtNet, and CNN + ST (ours) used for comparison purposes. Based on common practices in deploying deep learning models, one could infer that after training the model, it would likely undergo processes such as model serialization, platform selection, and possibly containerization before being deployed onto a suitable hardware infrastructure. Nevertheless, without specific details from the authors regarding the deployment process, these steps remain speculative.
