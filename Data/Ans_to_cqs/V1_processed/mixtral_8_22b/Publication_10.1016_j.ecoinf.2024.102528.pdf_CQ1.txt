The authors do not explicitly mention the specific method or device used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, they discuss using continuous bioacoustic monitoring, which suggests the use of audio recording devices such as microphones or other types of sensors capable of capturing bird vocalizations. These recordings would then be fed into the BirdNET-Analyzer deep learning model for processing and analysis. It can also be inferred from the context that the data collection process likely involves long-term passive acoustic monitoring, given the focus on detecting cryptic species' activities and analyzing avian influenza patterns.
