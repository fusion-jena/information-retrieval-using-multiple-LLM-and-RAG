The given context does not provide information about specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, or others. However, it mentions hyperparameter optimization for Support Vector Regression (SVR) where parameter C controls error tolerance during training and determines the maximum deviation that the model permits for any individual training example. Additionally, the text discusses the application of deep learning methods like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) for time-series predictions, without specifying the optimization techniques employed within these models.
