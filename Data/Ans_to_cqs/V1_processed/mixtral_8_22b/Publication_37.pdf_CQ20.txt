Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It only mentions that the model was trained for 100 epochs and was checkpointed after each epoch, and that it was implemented in Python using Lasagne and Pescador. However, it does not specify whether GPUs, TPUs, or any other hardware resources were utilized for training the model. Therefore, we cannot determine which hardware resources were used for training the deep learning model based solely on the provided context.
