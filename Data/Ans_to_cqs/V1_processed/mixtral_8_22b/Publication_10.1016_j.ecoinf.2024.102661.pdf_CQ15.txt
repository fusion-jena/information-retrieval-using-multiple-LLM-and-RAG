The text does not explicitly mention any specific optimization technique such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses the use of Tree Parzen Estimator Bayesian Optimization (TPEBO) for hyperparameter optimization in Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models. TPEBO is a sequential model-based optimization method that uses probabilistic models to guide the search for optimal hyperparameters. It starts with an exploration phase involving random searches for feasible hyperparameter configurations and then progressively focuses on areas within the search space where a local optimum is found, aiming to approximate the global optimum with increased precision. This approach is particularly useful for fine-tuning intricate LSTM models by automating the hyperparameter adjustment process, improving both model efficiency and reducing the time required for manual tuning.
