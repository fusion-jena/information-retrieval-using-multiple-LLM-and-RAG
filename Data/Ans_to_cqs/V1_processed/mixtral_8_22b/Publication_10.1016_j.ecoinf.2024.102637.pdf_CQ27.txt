The text does not provide explicit details on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, including aspects like model serialization or platform selection. However, it mentions that the model was designed to be lightweight and optimized for deep training and short-term testing. Additionally, it discusses merging two convolution layers during model deployment while maintaining nonlinear factors introduced by the activation function. These points suggest that the focus was on creating an efficient and streamlined model suitable for deployment. Nevertheless, without further information, it isn't possible to describe the exact steps taken for model deployment.
