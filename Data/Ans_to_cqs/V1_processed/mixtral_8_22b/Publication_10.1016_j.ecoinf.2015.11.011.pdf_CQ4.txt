The given context does not provide information about any specific data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses some pre-processing steps taken on imagery data such as segmentation, classification, fitting models at various scales, correcting for multiple comparisons, and using different bands or features like NDVI, image brightness, contrast, etc. for better discrimination between classes. It also mentions the use of a smooth function using the MRF basis and GAMs. But there is no mention of any data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotation, scaling, etc. typically used in deep learning pipelines.
