The study mentioned in the given context uses a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model to classify Land Cover/Land Use (LCLU) for the Talassemtane National Park (TNP) using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Therefore, the dataset used in this deep learning pipeline is not one of the commonly known datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it utilizes Sentinel-2 satellite imagery data for its analysis.

Sentinel-2 is an Earth observation mission developed by the European Space Agency (ESA), which provides high-resolution optical imagery for various applications, including environmental monitoring and land cover classification. By leveraging this rich source of data, the researchers aim to accurately classify LCLU within the TNP area, ultimately contributing to sustainable natural resource management efforts.
