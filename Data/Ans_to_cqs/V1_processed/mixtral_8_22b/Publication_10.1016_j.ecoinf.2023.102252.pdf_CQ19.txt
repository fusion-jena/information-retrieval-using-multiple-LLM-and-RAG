Based on the given context, there is no information about which specific frameworks were used to build the deep learning model. The text only mentions a discussion about the advantages and limitations of the model and future work in Section 6, but it does not provide any details regarding the implementation or development process of the model. Therefore, without additional context, it is impossible to determine which frameworks were used to build the deep learning model.
