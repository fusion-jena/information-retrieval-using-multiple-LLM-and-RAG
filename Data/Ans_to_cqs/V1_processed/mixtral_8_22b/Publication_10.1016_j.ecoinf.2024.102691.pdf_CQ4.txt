Based on the given context, there is no specific mention of any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotation, scaling, etc. Therefore, it cannot be determined which data augmentation techniques have been applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be noted that the input image size was set to 512 x 512 during model training, and the models were trained using a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer with an initial learning rate of 0.01 and a cycle learning rate of 0.2. Additionally, the models followed back-propagation after accumulating the batch size 32 times to prevent underfitting.
