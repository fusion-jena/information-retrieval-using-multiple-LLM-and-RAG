The given text does not explicitly mention specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of Regularized Extreme Learning Machines (RELM) for classification, suggesting that some form of regularization might be employed within this method. Additionally, the text refers to the Regularized Autoencoder Learning (MIGRATE_ELM), indicating that regularization techniques could also be involved in this process. Nevertheless, without further information, we cannot definitively identify the exact regularization methods used in these approaches.
