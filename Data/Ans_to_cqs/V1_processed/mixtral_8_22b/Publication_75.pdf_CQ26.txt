Based on the given context, it appears that there is no explicit mention of specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, the context does highlight the importance of certain factors that could potentially impact the overall performance of the classification or retrieval task. These include the quality of the original images, the preprocessing step (such as background cleaning and spacing of the seeds), and the imbalance of categories within the datasets.

While the context does not provide direct information about techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, these are indeed common strategies employed to mitigate issues related to data imbalance and bias. For instance, stratified sampling ensures that each category or label is proportionally represented in both training and testing sets. Oversampling involves duplicating examples from the minority classes, while undersampling reduces instances from the majority classes. Lastly, collecting diverse data helps ensure that the model generalizes well across different scenarios and populations.

In conclusion, although the context does not explicitly state the use of any particular technique to address data bias, it acknowledges the significance of handling data imbalances and biases. Common techniques to tackle these challenges include stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.
