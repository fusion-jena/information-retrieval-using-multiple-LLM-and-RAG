The given context does not provide information about specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) being applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions various machine learning models like Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), General Regression Neural Network (GRNN), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Transfer Learning (TL). These models can be optimized using different optimization techniques depending on the implementation. For instance, gradient descent algorithms like SGD or Adam could be used to minimize loss functions while training neural network models like GRNN. Nevertheless, based solely on the provided context, we cannot determine which optimization techniques were specifically utilized in the deep learning pipeline.
