The text does not explicitly mention the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in this study. To find out where it might be located, one would have to look through any associated publications, documentation, or contact the authors directly. It is common practice to share code repositories alongside academic papers, so checking related articles or conference proceedings could yield results. Some popular platforms for sharing code include GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket. Without further information, however, I cannot definitively state where the code repository for this particular project resides.
