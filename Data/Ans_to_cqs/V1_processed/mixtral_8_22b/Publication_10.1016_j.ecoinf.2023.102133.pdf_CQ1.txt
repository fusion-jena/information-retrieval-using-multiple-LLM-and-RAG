The study utilizes several methods for collecting raw data in its deep learning pipeline. For instance, it employs weather stations to record meteorological data such as wind speed, air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, and precipitation. Additionally, micro-meteorological data is collected through an eddy covariance (EC) tower, which measures variables like net radiation, sensible heat flux, latent heat flux, soil heat flux, and carbon dioxide concentration. These measurements are taken at sub-hourly intervals. Furthermore, the study uses remote sensing techniques to gather Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) data. Lastly, the research also makes use of publicly available datasets, including the world map of the KÃ¶ppen-Geiger climate classification and the global digital elevation model.
