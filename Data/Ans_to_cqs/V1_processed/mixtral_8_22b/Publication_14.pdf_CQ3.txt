The given context does not explicitly mention any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it mentions that the authors use a semi-automated system called 'AnimalFinder' for animal detection in time-lapse camera trap images (Price Tack et al., 2016). This suggests that some form of object detection technique might have been employed during the data annotation process. Additionally, the paper discusses training new models which implies that labeled data was likely used for supervised learning. Unfortunately, without more detailed information about the methods used, we cannot definitively state what specific data annotation techniques were utilized in the deep learning pipeline.
