The context does not provide explicit information about specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it mentions a feature normalization process during the backpropagation phase. This process involves adjusting the values of numeric columns in the data to a common scale without distorting differences in the ranges of values or losing information. Feature normalization is essential when applying machine learning algorithms to ensure that each attribute contributes proportionately to the final output. In the given context, feature normalization is mentioned as part of the developed network, which resembles the Transformer architecture used for text classification tasks.
