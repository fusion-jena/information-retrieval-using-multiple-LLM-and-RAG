Based on the given context, it appears that the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves evaluating the model using two metrics: the Area Under the receiver-operator Curve (AUC) and the True Skill Statistics (TSS).

The AUC values range from 0 to 1, where values closer to 1 indicate a higher accuracy of model prediction. This metric helps in understanding the overall performance of the model.

On the other hand, the TSS values range between -1 and +1. A TSS value of +1 means complete agreement between observed and predicted distributions, whereas values of â‰¤0 denote no better than random performance. This metric provides insights into how well the model predictions align with the actual observations.

Moreover, the context mentions that the AUC and TSS are the methods most commonly used to assess the model performance in species distribution model studies. However, it does not explicitly state when or how frequently these metrics are used during the training process. Therefore, while we know that these metrics are used to evaluate the model, the exact strategy for monitoring the model performance during training remains unclear based solely on the provided context.
