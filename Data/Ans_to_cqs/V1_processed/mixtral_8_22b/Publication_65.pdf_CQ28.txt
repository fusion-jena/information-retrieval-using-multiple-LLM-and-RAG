Unfortunately, based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of which specific cloud platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform was used to deploy the deep learning models. However, we do know that TensorFlow, a popular open-source library for machine learning, was utilized for implementing all deep learning-based models in this research. Furthermore, the experiments were carried out on a local workstation equipped with an Intel i7-8700K@3.70GHz CPU, 64GB RAM, and an NVIDIAÂ® GTX 1080 GPU with 12GB memory. Therefore, without additional details, it cannot be determined if any cloud platforms were employed for deployment purposes.
