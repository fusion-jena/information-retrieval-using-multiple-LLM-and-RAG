Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, specifically regarding random seed values. However, some common strategies to manage randomness in deep learning pipelines include:

1. Fixing the random seed: By setting a fixed random seed value, you can ensure reproducibility in your experiments. This means that every time you run your code, you get the same results, which makes debugging easier and allows others to reproduce your findings.

2. Using multiple seeds: To avoid overfitting or bias towards specific initial conditions, you can train your model with different random seeds and average their performance. This helps in understanding the variability of your model's performance due to random initialization.

3. Stratified sampling: When dealing with imbalanced datasets, stratified sampling ensures that each class is represented proportionally during training, reducing the impact of randomness on model performance.

4. Cross-validation: Performing cross-validation by splitting your dataset into k folds and iteratively training and testing your model on different subsets can help reduce the effect of randomness on model evaluation.
