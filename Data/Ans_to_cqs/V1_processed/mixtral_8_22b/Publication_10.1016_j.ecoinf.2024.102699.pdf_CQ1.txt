The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, there are some clues about the nature of the dataset used. In the context, it mentions the use of the bird audio detection data set from the DCASE challenge, which suggests that the authors might have collected raw data using publicly available datasets. Additionally, the context discusses the incorporation of various noise samples and non-bird audio elements into the dataset, indicating that the authors may have also used additional sources of data beyond the initial dataset. Nevertheless, without more explicit information on the data collection methods, it cannot be definitively stated what methods were specifically used for gathering raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
