Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be taken to ensure optimal performance. These may include data cleaning, where any irrelevant or incorrect information is removed from the dataset. Normalization and scaling are often employed to standardize the range of independent variables or features, ensuring they have similar scales so that no single feature dominates the others during training. This can involve techniques such as min-max scaling, z-score normalization, or even binary encoding for categorical variables. Additionally, handling missing values is crucial. Strategies might include removing rows with missing data, imputing missing values based on other data points, or employing machine learning algorithms specifically designed for this purpose. Lastly, exploratory data analysis (EDA) can provide insights into the distribution, outliers, and relationships within the data, guiding further preprocessing decisions.
