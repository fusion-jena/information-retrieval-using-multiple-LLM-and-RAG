The text does not provide explicit information regarding the use of optimization techniques in a deep learning pipeline. However, common optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). These methods help minimize the loss function during training, enabling the model to learn effectively from the input data. Other popular optimization techniques include RMSprop, AdaGrad, and Nadam. Each technique has its strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different types of problems and datasets.

The given context focuses primarily on the application of Best Management Practices (BMPs) for water quality improvement and the use of a tool to identify priority locations for implementing these practices. It discusses various features of the tool, such as searching for places or addresses, displaying pollutant loads before and after BMP implementation, and providing environmental justice indices. Additionally, it mentions the removal efficiencies of certain BMPs for Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Total Suspended Solids (TSS). Unfortunately, none of this information directly relates to optimization techniques employed in deep learning pipelines.
