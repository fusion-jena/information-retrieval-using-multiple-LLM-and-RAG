The context does not provide explicit information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, there are some clues regarding the types of images used in certain studies. For instance, one study mentioned using an image set consisting of ten images of the nematode-trapping fungus A. oligospora stained with SR2200, which is available at <https://github.com/hsueh-lab/FFT>. Another study used an image set previously employed in other research, such as (Lopez-Molina et al., 2015; Shokouh et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2019). Additionally, Sharma et al. (2017) worked with karyotyping images of chromosomes obtained through crowdsourcing. Unfortunately, none of these datasets correspond to well-known benchmark datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
