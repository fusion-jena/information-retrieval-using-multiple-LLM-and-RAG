Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide a detailed response about how the trained deep learning model was deployed. However, based on the given context, we can infer that the model was likely saved or serialized after being trained so it could be loaded later for predictions. This is a common practice in machine learning projects. As for platform selection, no specific details are mentioned regarding what kind of hardware or software environment was chosen for running the model.
