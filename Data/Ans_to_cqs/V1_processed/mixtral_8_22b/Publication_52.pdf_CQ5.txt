The paper mentions several datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for various tasks such as image classification, object recognition, and sound event classification. However, only one dataset is explicitly mentioned by name - the ImageNet LSVRC-2010 contest dataset containing 1.2 million high-resolution images classified into 1000 different classes. Other datasets mentioned include those used for object recognition tasks involving faces, pedestrians, and cars, but no specific names are given. Additionally, datasets used for sound event classification and automated bird acoustic event detection are also mentioned, but again, no specific names are provided. Therefore, based on the information available in this excerpt, we cannot provide a comprehensive list of all the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
