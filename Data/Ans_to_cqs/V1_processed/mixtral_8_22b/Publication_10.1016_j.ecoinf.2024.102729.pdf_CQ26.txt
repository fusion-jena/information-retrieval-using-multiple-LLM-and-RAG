The context does not provide specific details about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some commonly used techniques include stratified splitting, which ensures that each class is represented proportionally in all folds of the dataset; oversampling, where samples from minority classes are duplicated to balance the dataset; undersampling, where samples from majority classes are removed to achieve balance; and diverse data collection, which involves gathering data from various sources to ensure representation of different scenarios. These techniques help mitigate issues related to imbalanced datasets and improve the performance of deep learning models.

Based on the context, it appears that Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC) analysis is being used to identify correlations between environmental factors and Chl a levels in Poyang Lake. Machine Learning (ML) techniques like Random Forest (RF) modeling are also employed to predict Chl a levels, which serve as indicators of algal biomass and ecological states of inland waters. While the context does not explicitly mention techniques for addressing data bias, it highlights the use of advanced analytical tools and ML methods to understand complex relationships within large datasets.
