The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the use of terms like'sampling bias','species distribution models', 'area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)', and 'delta D', it can be inferred that the deep learning model might be used for classification or prediction tasks related to ecological studies, specifically in the field of species distribution modeling. This could involve classifying areas where certain species are likely to be found based on various environmental factors or predicting changes in species distributions due to factors like climate change or human activities.
