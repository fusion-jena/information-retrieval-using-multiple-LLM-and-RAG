Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be taken to improve its performance. These may include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing or correcting any errors, inconsistencies, or missing values in the dataset. It also includes handling outliers which might affect the model's accuracy.

2. Normalization/Standardization: This is done to rescale the features so they have zero mean and unit variance. This is important because many machine learning algorithms perform better when numerical input variables are scaled to a standard range. Common methods used for this purpose are Min-Max Scaling, Standardization (or z-score normalization), and Normalization by decimal scaling.

3. Feature Selection: This step involves selecting a subset of relevant features for use in model construction. This helps reduce overfitting, improves accuracy, and reduces training time.

4. Encoding Categorical Variables: Deep learning models cannot handle categorical data directly. Therefore, it needs to be converted into numerical form using techniques like label encoding, one hot encoding etc.

5. Train-Test Split: The dataset is divided into two parts - training set and test set. The model learns from the training set and then tested on the unseen test set to evaluate its performance.

6. Cross Validation: In order to ensure that our model generalizes well to new data, cross validation is performed where the available data is split into k subsets and the holdout method is repeated k times. Each time, one of the k subsets is used as the test set and the other kâˆ’1 subsets are put together to form a training set.
