The given context does not provide specific information about the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, translation, and color space transformations. These techniques help increase the size and diversity of training datasets, improve model generalization, and prevent overfitting. It is important to note that the choice of data augmentation technique depends on the nature of the problem and dataset being addressed.
