Based on the provided context, it appears that the pipeline uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for animal detection. This is suggested by the mention of YOLOv4, which is a popular object detection algorithm based on CNN architecture. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of MobileNetV3, another CNN architecture known for its efficiency and suitability for mobile and embedded vision applications. However, without explicit confirmation, it cannot be definitively stated that other types of deep learning models such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers are not also utilized within the pipeline.
