The article does not provide explicit information about specific techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some strategies related to sample selection and distribution.

To ensure adequate representation of all thematic classes, the authors implemented an alternative strategy instead of strictly distributing 196 training areas among the 6 thematic classes. They included pure training areas containing at least 50 pixels in total and prominently representing the class of interest. This distribution was carried out through simplified random sampling, which allowed capturing variability within each class and improving overall classification performance.

Additionally, the authors mentioned relying on Chuvieco (2020) to define training and testing samples. According to Chuvieco (2020), at least 196 test points should be considered for categorical variables. The authors also explored new sampling strategies combining previous scientific foundations with the current capabilities of Google Earth Engine (GEE).

In summary, while the article does not directly discuss techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, it highlights the importance of proper sample selection and distribution to minimize data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline.
