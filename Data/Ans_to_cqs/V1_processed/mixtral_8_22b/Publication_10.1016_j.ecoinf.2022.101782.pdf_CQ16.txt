The best model was selected based on minimal validation loss that occurred at epoch 448. This suggests that the criterion used to determine when training is complete is reaching the minimum validation loss. In this case, the training process continued until the validation loss reached its lowest point, which happened at epoch 448. After this point, further training may have led to overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data. Therefore, stopping the training process at the point of minimum validation loss helps prevent overfitting and ensures that the model generalizes well to new data.
