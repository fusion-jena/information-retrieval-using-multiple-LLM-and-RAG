Based on the given information, it appears that the deep learning model was deployed directly onto a mobile application rather than being hosted on a cloud service such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. The model was converted into the TensorFlow Lite format, which is specifically designed for performing deep learning tasks on smartphones and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This suggests that the model was integrated into the mobile application itself, allowing users to utilize its functionality without requiring an internet connection or access to a cloud server. However, if additional details about the deployment process are required, they may need to be obtained from supplementary sources, as the provided text does not explicitly mention any specific cloud platforms.
