Randomness in the deep learning pipeline can arise due to various factors such as initialization of weights, shuffling of data during training, or even the choice of hyperparameters. To handle this randomness, several strategies are commonly employed:

1. Fixed Random Seed: One common strategy is to set a fixed random seed value before running any code involving random operations. This ensures reproducibility across multiple runs of the same model, allowing researchers to compare results accurately. However, it should be noted that setting a fixed random seed does not eliminate randomness but rather makes it consistent across runs.

2. Multiple Runs: Another approach to handling randomness is to run the model multiple times with different initializations and/or seeds. By averaging the results over these runs, the impact of individual sources of randomness can be reduced. This technique is often used when evaluating the performance of models on benchmark datasets.

3. Cross-Validation: Cross-validation involves splitting the dataset into multiple subsets and training the model on each subset separately. This helps ensure that the model generalizes well to new data and reduces the risk of overfitting due to specific choices of train/test splits.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning: Hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and regularization strength can have a significant impact on model performance. Grid search or random search methods can be used to explore different combinations of hyperparameters and find the best configuration for a given problem.

5. Ensemble Methods: Ensemble methods combine the predictions of multiple models trained independently to improve overall performance. These techniques can help reduce variance caused by randomness in individual models and produce more robust predictions.
