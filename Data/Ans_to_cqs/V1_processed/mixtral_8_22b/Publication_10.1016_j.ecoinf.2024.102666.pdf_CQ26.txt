During the preprocessing stage of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed to address data bias. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting is a method used to ensure that each subset of data created from the original dataset maintains the same proportions of target classes as the original dataset. This technique helps prevent imbalanced datasets and ensures that all subsets have representative samples from each class.

Oversampling is another approach used to balance datasets with unequal distributions of classes. It involves duplicating examples from the minority class or creating synthetic examples based on existing ones. By increasing the number of instances belonging to the underrepresented class, oversampling aims to reduce the impact of class imbalance on model performance.

Undersampling, conversely, focuses on reducing the size of the majority class by randomly removing some of its instances. This technique attempts to achieve balanced class representation without introducing artificial data into the training set. However, it may lead to loss of valuable information if too many examples are removed.

Lastly, diverse data collection refers to gathering data from various sources and ensuring that they cover different aspects of the problem domain. Collecting diverse data helps improve generalization capabilities and reduces potential biases introduced by relying solely on one type of data source.

In summary, addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline involves implementing strategies such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Each technique serves a unique purpose in maintaining balanced class representations and minimizing potential biases within the dataset.
