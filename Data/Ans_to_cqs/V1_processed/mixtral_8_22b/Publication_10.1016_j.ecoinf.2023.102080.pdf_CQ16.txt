Unfortunately, based on the provided context, there isn't enough information to directly address the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as reaching a validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on aspects like covariate selection procedures, model algorithms, and computation times rather than the specifics of the training process itself. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based solely on the given context.
