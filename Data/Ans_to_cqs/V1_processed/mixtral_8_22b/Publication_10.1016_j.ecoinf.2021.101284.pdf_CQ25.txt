Based on the given context, there isn't enough information to determine the specific purpose of the deep learning model used in this study. However, we can infer that the authors have employed some form of machine learning or deep learning techniques due to the mention of 'Big Data', which often requires advanced computational methods for processing and analysis. Additionally, the use of terms like 'Maximum Entropy based Ecological Niche Model (ME-ENM)' suggests that they might have applied a supervised learning approach to predict the spread of COVID-19 cases based on various factors such as surface air temperature, precipitation, elevation, carbon dioxide levels, and population density. Nevertheless, without explicit details about the deep learning model's architecture, its exact purpose remains unclear.
