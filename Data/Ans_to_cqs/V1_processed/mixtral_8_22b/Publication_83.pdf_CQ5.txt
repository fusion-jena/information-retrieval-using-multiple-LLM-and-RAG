The paper by J. Xie et al. titled "Investigation of Different CNN-Based Models for Improved Bird Sound Classification" uses the CLO-43DS dataset for their experiments. However, it does not mention any other popular datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The CLO-43DS dataset contains recordings of 43 bird species collected using both directional and omnidirectional microphones. The dataset also includes variations in signal-to-noise ratios across different recordings. Detailed information about these bird species can be found in reference [23].
