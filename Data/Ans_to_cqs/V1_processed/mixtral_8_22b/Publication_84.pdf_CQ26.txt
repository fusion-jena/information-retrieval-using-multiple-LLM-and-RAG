The given context does not provide specific details about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some commonly used techniques to handle data bias include stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified sampling involves dividing the dataset into different subsets or strata based on certain criteria such as class labels, and then randomly selecting samples from each stratum to maintain the original distribution of classes. This technique ensures that all classes are represented proportionally in both training and testing datasets.

Oversampling is another approach where synthetic examples are generated from minority classes to balance the dataset. Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is one popular algorithm used for oversampling. It creates new instances by interpolating between existing minority class instances.

Undersampling, on the other hand, reduces the number of majority class instances to match the size of the minority class. Random Under Sampling (RUS) is a simple undersampling technique that removes random instances from the majority class until it matches the size of the minority class.

Finally, collecting diverse data can also help mitigate data bias. Collecting data from multiple sources, geographical locations, demographics, etc., can ensure that the model generalizes well across different scenarios.

These techniques should be applied judiciously depending upon the nature of the problem and the characteristics of the dataset being used.
