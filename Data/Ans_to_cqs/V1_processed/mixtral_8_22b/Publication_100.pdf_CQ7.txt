The data is divided based on its geographical location within each ALS project. Each project is horizontally segmented into stripes of width 900 pixels or 9.0 kilometers. These stripes are then further divided into three sections: the northernmost 5.4 kilometers for the training set, the subsequent 1.8 kilometers for the validation set, and the remaining 1.8 kilometers for the test set. This approach ensures an equal distribution of different regions and modalities among the three sets. The dataset comprises a total of 105,022,419 pixels (10,502 square kilometers) of ALS reference data. Out of these, 64,487,551 pixels (6449 square kilometers) are allocated for training, 20,784,407 pixels (2078 square kilometers) for validation, and 19,750,461 pixels (1975 square kilometers) for testing. This division adheres to the commonly employed '60-20-20' ratio in machine learning research.
