The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps after the model training. However, based on common practices in machine learning projects, some possible postprocessing steps could include evaluating the performance of the trained models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc. Additionally, confusion matrices might also be used to visualize the performance of the classifiers. Other techniques like saliency maps or GradCAM could potentially be applied to understand what parts of the input images were important for the model's predictions. Nevertheless, without explicit details about the project's goals and requirements, it is difficult to provide a definitive list of postprocessing steps.
