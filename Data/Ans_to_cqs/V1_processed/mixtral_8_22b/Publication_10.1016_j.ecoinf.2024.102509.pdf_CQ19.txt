The information provided does not explicitly mention which specific deep learning framework is being used to build the model. However, it mentions that the 'neuralnet' package of R 4.1.2 software is considered for developing a Backpropagation Artificial Neural Network (BP-ANN) model. Therefore, we can infer that the authors might be using the R programming language and its libraries or packages such as 'neuralnet' to develop their deep learning models. Unfortunately, without more explicit information, we cannot definitively state whether they use other popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
