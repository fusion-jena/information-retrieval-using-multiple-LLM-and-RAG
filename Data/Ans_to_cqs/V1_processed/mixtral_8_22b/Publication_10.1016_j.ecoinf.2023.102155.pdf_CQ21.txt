After the model training, there are several postprocessing steps that can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the task or application. Some common postprocessing steps include:

* Saliency Maps: These visualize which parts of the input image were most important for the model's decision making process. They help identify areas where the model may have focused too much attention or overlooked relevant features.
* Metrics Calculation: This involves calculating various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score etc. to evaluate the performance of the model. It helps determine how well the model has learned from the training data and its ability to generalize to new unseen data.
* Confusion Matrix: This is a table layout used to describe the performance of a classification algorithm. Each row represents the instances in an actual class while each column represents the instances in a predicted class. It provides insights into the types of errors made by the model and their frequency.

These postprocessing steps provide valuable feedback about the strengths and weaknesses of the trained model and guide further improvements. However, it should be noted that these steps are not mandatory and can vary based on the specific needs of the project.
