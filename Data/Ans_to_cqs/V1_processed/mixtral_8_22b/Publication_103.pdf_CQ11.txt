Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide a direct link to the deep learning pipeline data repository. The paper does not mention any links to repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. However, it acknowledges the support of the iDigBio initiative, which provides open access to biodiversity data, including herbarium data. It might be worth checking the iDigBio website or contacting the authors directly for more information about the availability of the deep learning pipeline data.
