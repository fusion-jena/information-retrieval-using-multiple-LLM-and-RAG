The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the authors might have used various sources such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets to gather information about the study species, environmental variables, and anthropogenic factors like distance-to-roads and distance-to-rivers. For instance, they could have collected temperature and precipitation data from meteorological stations or satellite imagery, while species occurrence data may have been obtained through field surveys or citizen science projects. Nevertheless, without explicit information regarding the data collection process, it remains speculative.
