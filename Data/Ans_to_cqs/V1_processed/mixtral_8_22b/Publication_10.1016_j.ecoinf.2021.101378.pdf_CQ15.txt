Based on the given context, there is no direct mention or discussion about specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning methods, specifically Random Forest and Maxent, for predicting the potential occurrence of pine wilt disease based on environmental factors in South Korea. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a helpful answer regarding optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline from this context alone.
