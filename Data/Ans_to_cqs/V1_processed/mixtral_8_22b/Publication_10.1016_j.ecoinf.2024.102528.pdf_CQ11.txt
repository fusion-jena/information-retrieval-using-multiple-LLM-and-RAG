Unfortunately, based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline or the Agmon annotated dataset. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct link to any data repository like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. However, it might be worth reaching out to the corresponding author Y. Lavner via email (yizharle@telhai.ac.il) for more detailed information regarding the availability of the dataset and its location in a public repository.
