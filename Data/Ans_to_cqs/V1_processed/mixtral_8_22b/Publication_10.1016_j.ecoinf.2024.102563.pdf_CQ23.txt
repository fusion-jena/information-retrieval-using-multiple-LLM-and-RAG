The paper does not provide information on any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it mentions the use of different classifiers such as Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Random Forest (RF) methods. These classifiers are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology based on overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient (K). Additionally, the study utilizes multi-textural features with an optimal window size to improve the classification accuracy. It also employs a graded proportion method of training sample selection for updating conventional soil maps. Nevertheless, the paper does not explicitly mention any techniques like diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to enhance the generalizability of the deep learning model.
