The deep learning model is built using the MXNet framework. MXNet is an open-source AI platform that offers a comprehensive suite of neural network models and functionalities for AI development. It serves as the central computational module when combined with GluonCV, GluonNLP, and GluonTS, forming a robust development system. In this study, GluonCV was specifically used to develop LaDeco. GluonCV offers a set of 25 segmentation models, some of which have been trained on the ADE20K dataset, making them suitable for landscape applications.
