The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it mentions that the new models developed in this study encompass lakes and rivers with diverse trophic states, which could be considered a form of data diversity. Additionally, the use of a separate set of water samples for validation suggests some level of model testing beyond the initial calibration phase. Nonetheless, without more detailed information regarding the methodology employed, it is difficult to definitively identify all the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
