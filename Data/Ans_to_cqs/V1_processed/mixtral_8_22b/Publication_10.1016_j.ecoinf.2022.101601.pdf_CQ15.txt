The given context does not provide information about optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. However, I can still share some common optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines. These include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Momentum, Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), and AdaGrad. Each technique has its own strengths and weaknesses, and their effectiveness may vary depending on the specific problem being addressed. For instance, SGD is simple but might converge slowly, while Adam combines the advantages of RMSProp and momentum, providing faster convergence.
