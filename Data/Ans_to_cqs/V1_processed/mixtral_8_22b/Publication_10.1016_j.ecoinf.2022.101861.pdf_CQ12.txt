The text does not provide explicit information on the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it mentions that the pipeline uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) for identifying bird and frog species in tropical soundscape recordings (LeBien et al., 2020). Therefore, we can infer that one component of the pipeline employs a CNN. Unfortunately, without additional context, we cannot determine if other types of models are also utilized within the pipeline.
