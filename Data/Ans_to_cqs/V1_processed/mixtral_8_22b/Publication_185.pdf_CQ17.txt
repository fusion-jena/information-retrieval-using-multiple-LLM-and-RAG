In this context, two regularization methods are mentioned to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline: dropout and L2 regularization. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to make the model more robust and prevents overfitting. In this case, the dropout ratio is set to 0.5. On the other hand, L2 regularization is a method that adds a penalty term to the loss function, encouraging smaller weights and preventing overfitting. Here, L2 weight decay with a penalty multiplier set to 5 Ã— 10^-4 is applied. These techniques help ensure that the deep learning models can generalize well even when trained on small datasets.
