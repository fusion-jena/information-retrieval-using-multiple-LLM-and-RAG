The text does not provide information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the data layers used for the IFDS prototype include meteorological data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, and solar radiation. Additionally, other factors like human influence, lightning-induced fires, vegetation, aspect, and slope are also considered. These data layers are derived from various sources and projects, but no specific dataset names are mentioned.
