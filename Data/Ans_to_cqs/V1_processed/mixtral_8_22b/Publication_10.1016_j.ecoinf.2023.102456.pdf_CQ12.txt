The text does not explicitly mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the proposed intelligent cellular scheme. However, it mentions that a neural network (ANN) is employed to define the neighborhood relationship Rk. This suggests that some form of artificial neural network is utilized within the model. The backpropagation algorithm is mentioned as being central to the approach, which is commonly associated with feedforward neural networks. Nevertheless, without further information, it cannot be definitively stated whether the model specifically employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers, or another type of deep learning model.
