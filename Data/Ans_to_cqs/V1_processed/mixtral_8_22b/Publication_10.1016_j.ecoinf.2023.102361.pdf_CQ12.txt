The text does not explicitly state what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline. However, it mentions several specific deep learning models such as VGG16, VGG19, ResNet-50, DenseNet121, DenseNet169, DenseNet201, and MobileNetV2. All of these models are types of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Therefore, it can be inferred that the pipeline uses CNNs for image classification tasks.
