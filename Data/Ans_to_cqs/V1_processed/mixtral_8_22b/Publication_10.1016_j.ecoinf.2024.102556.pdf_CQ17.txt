Regularization methods are techniques used in machine learning and deep learning models to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise, and performs poorly on unseen data or test data. Regularization helps to reduce the complexity of the model and improve its generalization capabilities. In the context of deep learning pipelines, two commonly used regularization methods are Dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to prevent complex co-adaptations on training data. Essentially, dropout adds randomness to the training process, making the model more robust and less likely to overfit. During each iteration of the training phase, individual nodes are either dropped out of the net with probability (1 - keep_prob), or kept with probability keep_prob.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is another popular method to prevent overfitting. It works by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages large weights in the model. The penalty term is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights, hence the name L2 regularization. By keeping the weights small, L2 regularization encourages simpler models that generalize better to new data.

In summary, both Dropout and L2 regularization are effective techniques to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. While Dropout introduces randomness to the training process, L2 regularization penalizes large weights in the model. Both methods help to create simpler models that perform well on unseen data.
