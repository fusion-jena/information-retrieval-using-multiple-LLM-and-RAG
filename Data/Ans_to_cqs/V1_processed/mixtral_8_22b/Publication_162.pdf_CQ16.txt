The text does not explicitly mention any specific criteria for determining when training is complete. However, based on common practices in machine learning, some possible criteria could include reaching a predefined number of epochs, achieving a desired level of performance on a validation dataset, observing no further improvement in validation accuracy or loss, or meeting other custom stopping rules defined by the researchers. It would be best to consult the original research paper or documentation for precise details regarding the completion of training.
