Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of the specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding its location on platforms such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. However, considering the common practices in sharing research materials, especially in machine learning projects, one might look for the code and trained models on popular platforms like GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab. Additionally, researchers often share their datasets on public repositories like Kaggle, Google Drive, Dropbox, or even academic databases related to their respective fields. Without further details, it would be best to contact the authors directly or check any associated publications for links to the required resources.
