The text does not provide explicit information about the use of regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that some preprocessing steps like data augmentation and normalization are performed to address the diversity of training data and data imbalance problems in classification tasks. These techniques could potentially help reduce overfitting, but they do not directly correspond to traditional regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot determine if any specific regularization methods have been employed to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
