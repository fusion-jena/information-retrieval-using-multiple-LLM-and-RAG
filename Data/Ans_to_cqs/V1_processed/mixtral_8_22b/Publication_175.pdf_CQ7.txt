The context does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, typically, the dataset is randomly partitioned into three subsets: training set, validation set, and testing set. The training set is used to fit the parameters of the model, while the validation set is used to tune the hyperparameters of the model. Finally, the testing set is used to evaluate the performance of the fully specified model. In some cases, cross-validation techniques can be employed to ensure robustness and generalization of the results.
