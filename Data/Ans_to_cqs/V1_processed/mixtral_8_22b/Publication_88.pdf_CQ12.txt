The pipeline uses a deep learning model called Efficient Feature Network (EF). This model is based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. It consists of three convolutional layers, Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs), two max-pooling layers, and two fully connected layers. At the end, there is a softmax layer with two outputs, corresponding to the "deforestation" and "no-deforestation" classes. The filter and output sizes of each layer are detailed in Table 3.
