A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used in the proposed model architecture. This is evident from the description of the model implementation details and the visual representation of the model architecture in Figure 5. The use of convolutional layers, denoted in cyan, indicates the application of CNN principles. Furthermore, the mention of kernel sizes and output channels supports this conclusion. Additionally, the explanation of how a CNN gradually transforms its inputs into outputs using a series of simple transformations aligns with the characteristics of a CNN.
