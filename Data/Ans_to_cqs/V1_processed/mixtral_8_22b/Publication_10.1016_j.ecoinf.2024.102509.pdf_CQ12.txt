The text does not provide explicit information about the use of a specific deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. However, it mentions the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in modeling grassland above-ground biomass. ANNs are a subset of machine learning algorithms inspired by biological neural networks and are commonly used for various tasks like pattern recognition, classification, and forecasting. Although they share some similarities with deep learning models, ANNs are generally considered distinct from them due to differences in architecture and complexity. Therefore, based on the given context, we cannot definitively state which type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline.
