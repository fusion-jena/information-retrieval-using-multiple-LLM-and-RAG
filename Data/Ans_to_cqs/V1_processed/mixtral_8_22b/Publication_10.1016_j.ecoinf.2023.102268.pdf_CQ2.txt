The deep learning pipeline described in the given context uses spectrogram images as inputs for the ResNet-50 deep convolutional neural network (CNN). These spectrogram images are generated from unfiltered waveforms around each detection. Therefore, the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is image data. However, it is important to note that these images are derived from audio data, specifically underwater sounds or marine soundscapes. Thus, while the direct input to the CNN is image data, the underlying source of information is audio data.
