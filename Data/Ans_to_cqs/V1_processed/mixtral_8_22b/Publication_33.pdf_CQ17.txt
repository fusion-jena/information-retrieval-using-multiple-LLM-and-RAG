In the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization being used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does reference the concept of preventing overfitting through stopped training, which is mentioned in source number 45 ("Stopped training and other remedies for overfitting" by Sarle, W. S.).

Regularization methods are techniques used to prevent overfitting during the training process of a deep learning model. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the noise in the training data rather than generalizing patterns, leading to poor performance on new, unseen data. Regularization helps mitigate this issue by adding constraints to the learning process, making the model more generalized and improving its ability to perform well on new data.

Two common regularization methods include dropout and L2 regularization. Dropout involves randomly deactivating a certain percentage of neurons during each iteration of training, forcing the remaining neurons to adapt and become more resilient. On the other hand, L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function based on the magnitude of weights, encouraging smaller weight values and reducing complexity in the model.

While these specific regularization methods aren't explicitly discussed in the provided context, they remain important tools for combatting overfitting in deep learning pipelines.
