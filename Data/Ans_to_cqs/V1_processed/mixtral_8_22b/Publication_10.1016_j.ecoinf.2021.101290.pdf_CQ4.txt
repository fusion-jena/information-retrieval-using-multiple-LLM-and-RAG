Unfortunately, the provided context does not directly address the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotation, scaling, etc. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer using only the information given. However, I can share some general knowledge about these common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines.

Data augmentation is a strategy employed to increase the diversity of training datasets without collecting new data. It involves creating modified versions of images in the dataset through various transformations like:

1. Flipping: Images can be horizontally or vertically flipped to create new variations. Horizontal flips are more commonly used since they often preserve the object's label.

2. Rotation: Images can be rotated by different angles to generate new samples. This helps the model learn features invariant to orientation changes.

3. Scaling: Images can be scaled up or down to simulate objects appearing closer or farther away. This helps the model recognize objects regardless of their size in the image.

4. Translation: Images can be shifted along the x and y axes to mimic small movements of the camera or object. This encourages the model to identify features irrespective of their position within the frame.

5. Shearing: Applying shear transformation distorts the shape of objects in the image, helping the model understand deformations.

6. Noise injection: Adding random noise to the pixels of an image can help the model become robust against noisy inputs.

These techniques allow models to better generalize and perform well on unseen data. Keep in mind that the choice of data augmentation techniques depends on the problem domain and the nature of the input data.
