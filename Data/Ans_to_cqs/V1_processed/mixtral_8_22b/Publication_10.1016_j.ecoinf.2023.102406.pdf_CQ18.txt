The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is to use accuracy metrics on separate testing data, or withheld known classes. This allows for determining how well the classifier assigns classes using predictor variables. In this case, 25% of samples were used as testing data, which was randomly sampled and is considered a standard modeling practice. The true positive rate or sensitivity measures the number of predicted observations accurately assigned to a class, while the true negative rate or specificity measures the number of predicted observations where the response variable of interest did not occur.
