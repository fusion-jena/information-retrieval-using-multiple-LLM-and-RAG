The purpose of the deep learning model is semantic segmentation for vegetation mapping. This model is used to identify different substrate types, achieving an accuracy of 92%. It has a precision of 0.90 for the vegetation class, 0.96 for the bare class, and 0.50 for the 'other' class when evaluated against the test dataset. The recall of the model reaches 0.97 for vegetation, 0.87 for bare substrate, and 0.53 for the 'other' class. Additionally, there is mention of a DETR model for object detection, specifically for detecting turtles in images.
