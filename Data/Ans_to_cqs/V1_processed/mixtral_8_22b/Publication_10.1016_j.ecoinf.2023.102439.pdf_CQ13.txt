Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. However, it does mention that the model uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with a NARX feedback structure. It also mentions that the input layer consists of three processing elements (neurons) corresponding to the LST, temperature, and precipitation parameters, while the EVI data was used as the output layer. Additionally, the context discusses the importance of determining the optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer to achieve the best results. Therefore, while we cannot provide exact details regarding the learning rate or optimizer, we can confirm that the model involves tuning the number of neurons in the hidden layer as one of its hyperparameters.
