Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline does not explicitly mention any specific data format such as images, audio, video, or CSV. However, it does discuss the use of a Python 3.6.8 package called Ray, version 1.9.2, for managing parallel configurations between two Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) ProLiant DL560 Gen10 nodes. These nodes are equipped with four processors Intel Xeon Gold 5118 2.30GHz, 12 cores, 24 threads, and 512 GB of RAM.

Moreover, the context mentions that the hybrid MCMC algorithm provides a series of independent chains containing a trace of values for each parameter to estimate. These traces are stored in specific text files and can be further analyzed to obtain the final parameter values, their distribution, and their associated uncertainty. This suggests that the data being processed might be numerical or tabular data rather than multimedia data like images or videos.

However, without explicit information about the nature of the input data, it cannot be definitively stated what type of data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline. It could potentially handle various types of data depending on the specific application and requirements.
