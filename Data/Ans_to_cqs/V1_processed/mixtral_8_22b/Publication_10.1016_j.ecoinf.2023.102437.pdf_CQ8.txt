The given context does not provide information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It discusses various aspects related to machine learning models, such as Random Forest (RF) models, Lasso models, and their applications in environmental science, particularly in forecasting ENSO (El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation). However, it does not mention any specific details regarding the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this query based on the given context.
