The text does not provide information on which specific cloud computing platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the study uses the Google Earth Engine (GEE), a cloud computing platform developed by Google for processing geospatial datasets. Therefore, it is possible that the deep learning model was deployed on the Google Cloud Platform, but this cannot be confirmed based solely on the given information.
