Unfortunately, there is no mention of where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available in the given context. It does not provide any information about the use of version control systems like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available based on the given context.
