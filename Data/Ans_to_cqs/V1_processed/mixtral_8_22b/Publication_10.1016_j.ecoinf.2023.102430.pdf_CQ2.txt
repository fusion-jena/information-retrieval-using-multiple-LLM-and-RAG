The deep learning pipeline described in this context uses images as its primary data format. Specifically, it processes low-resolution pictures of insects belonging to the subfamily Triatominae. However, instead of feeding the raw images directly into the machine learning algorithms, they first extract 226 numerical 'features' from the images using Inovtaxon software. These extracted features represent various attributes of the images such as color, shape, and texture. Therefore, while the initial input is in image format, the actual data fed into the machine learning algorithms consists of these numeric feature vectors.
