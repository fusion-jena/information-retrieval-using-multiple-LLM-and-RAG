The provided context does not directly address the query about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide some general strategies often employed to manage randomness in such scenarios.

Randomness in deep learning pipelines often arises due to factors like random initialization of weights, shuffling of training data, or using dropout layers for regularization. To ensure reproducibility and consistency across experiments, several strategies can be adopted:

1. Fixed Random Seeds: One common strategy is to fix the random seed values for various libraries involved in the pipeline, including NumPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc. This ensures that the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers is generated every time the code runs, leading to consistent results.

2. Deterministic Algorithms: Some algorithms have deterministic versions that do not rely on randomness. For instance, certain implementations of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) use deterministic weight initialization methods instead of random ones. Using these alternatives can help reduce variability in outcomes.

3. Data Shuffle Control: Controlling the way data is shuffled before being fed into the model can also impact the final results. Enforcing a specific order or disabling shuffling altogether might be necessary depending on the application requirements.

4. Model Architecture Choices: Selecting models without inherently random components, such as avoiding dropout layers or batch normalization, can further minimize randomness in the pipeline.

5. Repeat Experiments: Running multiple trials with different seeds and averaging the results can provide insights into the overall performance and robustness of the model.
