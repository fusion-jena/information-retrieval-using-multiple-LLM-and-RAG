In the given context, several data augmentation techniques have been mentioned for expanding the training dataset. These include random adjustments to image size, image flipping, cropping, and conversion. Image flipping involves horizontally or vertically reversing the original image, while cropping entails removing parts of the image to focus on specific areas. Random adjustments to image size involve resizing the image without maintaining its aspect ratio, leading to distortion. Lastly, conversion could refer to changing the color space or format of the image. However, the exact nature of the conversion technique used here isn't explicitly stated in the provided context.
