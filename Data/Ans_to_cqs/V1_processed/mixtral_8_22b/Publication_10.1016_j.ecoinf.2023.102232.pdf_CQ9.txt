The data repository of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it does mention that all the scripts and datasets required to reproduce the results of this work are publicly available at <https://github.com/lucaros1190/LS-MCMC-hybridGenAlgo>. Therefore, it can be assumed that the data repository is hosted on GitHub under the username 'lucaros1190'. It should be noted that GitHub is not specifically designed for hosting large datasets or repositories, unlike platforms such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Nevertheless, researchers often use GitHub to share code, small datasets, and other resources related to their research projects.
