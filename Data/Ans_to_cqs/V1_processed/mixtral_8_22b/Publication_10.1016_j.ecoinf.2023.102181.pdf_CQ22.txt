The text does not provide information about a deep learning model or its evaluation metrics. However, it mentions two metrics used to measure the performance of a model: variance explained (^ve) and root mean square error (^rmse). Variance explained is a relative measure of performance, while root mean square error is an absolute performance metric measured in response units. These metrics are used to calculate the change in true performance at predicting each response variable after applying bagging weights based on KDE and spatial covariance approaches for all simulation runs.
