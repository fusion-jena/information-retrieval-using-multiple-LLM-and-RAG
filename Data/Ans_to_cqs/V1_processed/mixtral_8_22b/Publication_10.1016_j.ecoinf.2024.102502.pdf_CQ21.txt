The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. However, it can be inferred that the authors might have used some form of evaluation methods to assess their models' performance. In general, common postprocessing steps include evaluating the model using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves etc.; generating visualizations like saliency maps, confusion matrices, ROC curves etc.; and performing statistical tests to validate the results. But without explicit information about these steps in the given context, we cannot provide a definitive answer.
