Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, it can be inferred from the text that the authors used a method to find an optimal balance between precision and recall metrics by searching for a θ-threshold by class. They observed the highest measure of the harmonic mean (F1 score) and varied the F score to decrease the β coefficient down to 0.5, providing a higher ponderation to the precision than to the recall. It is not clear if this optimization process involved methods such as grid search or random search. Therefore, without additional context, it cannot be determined exactly how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized.
