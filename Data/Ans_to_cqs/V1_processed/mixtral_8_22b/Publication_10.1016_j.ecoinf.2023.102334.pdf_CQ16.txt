The text does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete for the proposed model or any of the comparison models. However, based on common practices in machine learning, we can infer that several possible criteria might have been used. These include reaching a certain number of epochs, achieving a desired level of accuracy or loss on the training set, observing no further improvement in validation loss or accuracy over multiple epochs (i.e., a validation loss plateau), or meeting a predefined threshold for early stopping. Without more information from the original source, it is impossible to definitively state which criteria were employed in this particular case.
