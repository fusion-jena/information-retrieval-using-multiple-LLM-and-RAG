The text does not provide information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it mentions that the implementation of the deep neural network algorithm, called IUC-NN, is available as an R package named IUCNN on GitHub (<https://github.com/azizka/IUCNN>). It also states that the predictions were made using digitally available occurrence records, but no specific repositories are mentioned. Therefore, without additional information, we cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is located.
