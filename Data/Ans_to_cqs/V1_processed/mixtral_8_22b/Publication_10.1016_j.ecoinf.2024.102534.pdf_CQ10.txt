Unfortunately, there isn't enough context to provide a direct link to the deep learning pipeline's code repository. None of the given sources explicitly mention a specific deep learning pipeline or its corresponding code repository. Therefore, it's not possible to determine the exact link to the GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository containing the deep learning pipeline's source code.
