The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves partitioning the corresponding dataset into training, validation, and testing sets with a different random seed in each replication. The performance metrics on the test set are then averaged over three replications for eventual model assessment. This process is conducted within the framework of PyTorch (version 1.13.1) with Torchvision (version 0.14.1), OpenCV (version 4.7.0), and CUDNN (version 9.2) on an NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPU.
