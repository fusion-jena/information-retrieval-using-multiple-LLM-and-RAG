The papers by Halgamuge et al. (2020) and Dowdy (2020) focus on utilizing deep learning for wildfire event predictions in Australia but do not explicitly mention any specific data augmentation techniques used in their respective studies. Data augmentation is a strategy employed during model training to increase the amount of available training data without actually collecting new data. Commonly used data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, and shearing images. However, these techniques may vary depending on the type of dataset being used. In the case of wildfire event predictions, it might involve manipulating satellite imagery or other relevant datasets. Unfortunately, based on the given information, I cannot provide specific details about the data augmentation techniques used in these studies.
