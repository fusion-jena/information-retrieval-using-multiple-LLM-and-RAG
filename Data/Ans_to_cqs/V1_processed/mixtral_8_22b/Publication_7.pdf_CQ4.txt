The text does not provide information about the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were utilized, which often employ various data augmentation methods like flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, and color jittering to improve model performance and prevent overfitting. These techniques help increase the diversity of training data without collecting new samples. Unfortunately, the exact data augmentation techniques used in this case remain unknown due to insufficient details in the given context.
