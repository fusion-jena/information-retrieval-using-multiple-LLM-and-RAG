The information provided does not include any details about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The sources mentioned are primarily research papers discussing various aspects of deep learning techniques, such as their use in predicting total phosphorus concentration in rivers, their applications in agriculture, and optimization methods for neural network weights. However, none of these sources provide specific links or references to a code repository. Therefore, without additional information, it is impossible to determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
