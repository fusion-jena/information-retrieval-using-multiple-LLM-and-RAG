The study utilizes various methods for collecting raw data in its deep learning pipeline. These include direct observation and documentation by the research team, on-the-ground observations, and information provided by park rangers. Additionally, a subset of the dataset is obtained from other sources not explicitly mentioned in the given context. It can be inferred that these methods involve some form of survey or sensor data collection, although specific details about the types of sensors used or the nature of the surveys conducted are not provided. Furthermore, there is no explicit mention of using public datasets in this particular study. However, it should be noted that utilizing publicly available datasets is a common practice in many deep learning pipelines, depending on the requirements and objectives of the study.
