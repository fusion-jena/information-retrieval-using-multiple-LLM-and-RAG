The given context does not provide information on the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, common metrics for evaluating the performance of machine learning or deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, and area under the curve (AUC). Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions made by the model. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made by the model. Recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positives in the dataset. F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both. ROC curve plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate, while AUC represents the probability that a randomly chosen positive instance will be ranked higher than a randomly chosen negative one. These metrics can help assess the overall performance of the model and its ability to accurately classify instances.
