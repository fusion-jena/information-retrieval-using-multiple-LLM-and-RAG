Based on the given context, it appears that the text does not explicitly mention any specific hyperparameters related to a deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. Instead, it discusses the use of Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for estimating species distribution based on bioclimatic variables. In this case, the mentioned hyperparameters for UMAP are the number of neighbors and minimum distance.

For this particular study, these hyperparameters were kept constant, with the minimum distance set at 0.005 and the number of neighbors set at 15. It is suggested that further analysis should explore how different hyperparameter calibrations might affect the performance of the model. Additionally, since UMAP is a stochastic method, an evaluation of how randomness impacts the results would help determine the level of variability.

Therefore, without additional information about the deep learning model used in conjunction with UMAP, I cannot provide details regarding other potential hyperparameters like learning rate or optimizer.
