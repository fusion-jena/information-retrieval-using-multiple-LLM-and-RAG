The context does not provide specific details on handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, including managing random seed values. However, common strategies include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility or employing techniques like cross-validation and ensemble methods to mitigate the impact of randomness on model performance. These approaches help ensure consistent results across multiple runs and improve overall robustness.
