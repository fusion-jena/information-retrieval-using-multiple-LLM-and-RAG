The provided context does not explicitly mention which frameworks were used to build the deep learning models. However, it lists several machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Boosted Regression Trees, Generalised Boosted Models, Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, etc. These algorithms can be implemented using various programming languages and libraries like Python, R, or Julia, and their respective packages like scikit-learn, caret, keras, tensorflow, pytorch, etc. Without further details about the implementation of these models, it is impossible to determine which specific frameworks were used.
