After constructing the UMAP model, several postprocessing steps were performed on the testing data embedded into the model. These included computing the nearest neighbor Euclidean distance between species-species (Dss) and background-species (Dsb) for both training and test data. The cumulative empirical distribution function of the intra-species distance Dss, denoted as Pss, was also calculated. This was done using a step function where the proportion of observations less than or equal to a given distance D was determined.

After calculating Pss, the value of S = (1 - Pss) was determined for the distances between the background and species. Additionally, the workflow to analyze the similarity between a target species and its environment was presented in Figure 1.

To assess the performance of UMAP as a binary classifier, several metrics were estimated. These included the area under the curve (AUC), receiver operating characteristics (ROC), kappa index K, and the point-biserial correlation (COR) index. The AUC ranges between 0 and 1, with values closer to 1 indicating better model performance. The kappa index ranges between -1 and +1, with positive values indicating agreement beyond chance and negative values indicating disagreement beyond chance.

Mutual information coefficients were also used to measure the relative importance of bioclimatic variables as related to latent distance. For example, in the case of A. cephalotes, BIO01, BIO04, and BIO12 shared more information and were more clearly related to distance.

In summary, the postprocessing steps involved after model training include computing nearest neighbor Euclidean distances, calculating the cumulative empirical distribution function of intra-species distance, determining the value of S, presenting the workflow to analyze similarity between a target species and its environment, estimating various metrics such as AUC, ROC, kappa index K, COR index, and calculating mutual information coefficients.
