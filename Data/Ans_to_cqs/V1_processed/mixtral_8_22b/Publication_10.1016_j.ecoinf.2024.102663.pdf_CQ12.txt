The text does not explicitly mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it suggests incorporating Bidirectional LSTM with GloVe embeddings, indicating that some form of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), might be employed. Additionally, the text mentions modifying the architecture of deep learning models like YOLO, suggesting that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are also considered. Without further context, it cannot be definitively stated whether the pipeline uses only one type of deep learning model or combines multiple types, such as both RNNs and CNNs.
