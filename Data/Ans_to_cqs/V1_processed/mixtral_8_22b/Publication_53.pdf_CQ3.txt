The authors utilized a binary classification approach for labeling the images into either 'dam' or 'not dam'. This was done through a supervised learning method where a subset of 400 images from the total 7362 images was randomly selected and labeled accordingly. The remaining images were then classified using the trained model, which was later checked and corrected manually if necessary. This process continued iteratively until all images were labeled. No specific mention of other data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation was made in the given context.
