The information provided does not mention the specific data repository of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is not possible to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It could potentially be available on platforms such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF, but without further information, this cannot be confirmed.
