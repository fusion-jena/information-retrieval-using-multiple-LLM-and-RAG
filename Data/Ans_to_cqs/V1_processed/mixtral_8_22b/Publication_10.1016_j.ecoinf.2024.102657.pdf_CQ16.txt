The text does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, it mentions that the validation set was used to tune the hyperparameters of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This suggests that the model's performance on the validation set might have been monitored during training to decide when to stop training. Common criteria for stopping training include reaching a certain number of epochs, early stopping when the validation loss stops improving, or when the validation accuracy reaches a satisfactory level. Without more specific details, it cannot be definitively stated what exact criteria were used to determine when training was complete.
