The given context does not provide information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models mentioned in the text. However, it can be inferred that some form of high-performance computing resources would likely be required due to the computational demands of deep learning algorithms. These could include Graphical Processing Units (GPUs), Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), or other specialized hardware designed for machine learning tasks. Additionally, Apache Spark was mentioned as being used for accelerating deep learning inference for large-scale satellite image analytics, suggesting that distributed computing resources may also play a role in these types of applications.
