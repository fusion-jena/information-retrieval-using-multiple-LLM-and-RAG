Unfortunately, there isn't any explicit mention or discussion about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, specifically regarding random seed values, within the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based solely on the provided text. However, it's common practice in machine learning and deep learning projects to set a fixed random seed value before running experiments to ensure reproducibility and consistency across different runs.
