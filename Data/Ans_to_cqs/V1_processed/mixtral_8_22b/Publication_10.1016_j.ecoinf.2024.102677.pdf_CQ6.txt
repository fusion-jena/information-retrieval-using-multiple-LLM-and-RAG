Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning models for landscape type classification. However, some common preprocessing steps often used in deep learning include data normalization, scaling, cleaning, and augmentation. These steps help improve the quality and consistency of the input data, which can lead to better model performance.

Data normalization involves adjusting values measured on different scales to a common scale, such as rescaling numerical inputs between 0 and 1 or applying z-score normalization. Scaling may also be necessary if certain features have significantly larger magnitudes compared to others, potentially affecting the model's ability to learn effectively.

Cleaning the data refers to handling missing or inconsistent entries, removing noise, and addressing outliers. Properly cleaned datasets contribute to more accurate predictions and improved overall model performance.

Data augmentation is another technique frequently applied in deep learning tasks involving images. It generates new samples by applying transformations like rotation, flipping, zooming, cropping, or shifting to existing images. Data augmentation helps increase the diversity of the training dataset and reduces overfitting.

Although the context does not provide explicit information about the preprocessing steps used, it mentions that the models were trained on an NVIDIA 3090 GPU with a 256 x 256 image input size. This suggests that some form of image resizing or rescaling might have been implemented as part of the preprocessing stage.
