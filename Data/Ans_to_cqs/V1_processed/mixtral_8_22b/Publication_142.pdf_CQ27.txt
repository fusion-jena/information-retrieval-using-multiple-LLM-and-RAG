The text does not provide explicit details about the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it mentions that access to the Pl@ntNet classification tool is provided through a dedicated API available at my.plantnet.org. This suggests that the model was deployed using an Application Programming Interface (API). APIs allow different software applications to communicate with each other and share functionalities or information. In this case, the API enables users to send requests containing one to five images of a plant and receive a list of likely species along with their classification scores and matching images retrieved from the database.

While the exact process of model deployment isn't mentioned, common steps involved in deploying a deep learning model include model serialization, platform selection, and setting up an appropriate environment for serving predictions. Model serialization involves converting the trained model into a format that can be stored and loaded efficiently. Popular formats for storing serialized models include Protocol Buffers (protobuf), ONNX, and TensorFlow's SavedModel format. Once the model has been serialized, it needs to be hosted on a suitable platform capable of handling incoming requests and returning predictions. Common platforms for hosting machine learning models include cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, and self-hosted solutions such as Flask, FastAPI, or Django.

In summary, while the text doesn't explicitly state the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, it implies that the model was made accessible via a dedicated API. Typically, deploying a deep learning model involves model serialization, selecting a suitable platform, and setting up an appropriate environment for serving predictions.
