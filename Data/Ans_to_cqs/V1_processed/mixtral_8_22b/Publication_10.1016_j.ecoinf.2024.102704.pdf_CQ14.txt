The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, such as through methods like grid search or random search. However, it can be inferred from the context that some form of optimization was performed, particularly for improving detection accuracy and inference speed.

In Figure 3, we see the results of the optimization process involving the C1 module. This figure shows both a model complexity histogram and a model accuracy and inference speed chart. From these visualizations, it appears that the authors have experimented with different configurations of the C1 module to find the optimal balance between model complexity, accuracy, and inference speed.

While the specific method used for hyperparameter optimization is not mentioned, common techniques include grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and evolutionary algorithms. Given the focus on balancing multiple objectives (accuracy and inference speed), it is possible that the authors employed multi-objective optimization techniques, which aim to find solutions that perform well across several criteria simultaneously.

In conclusion, while the exact method used for hyperparameter optimization is not specified in the given context, it can be inferred that some form of optimization was carried out to improve detection accuracy and inference speed. Common optimization techniques include grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and evolutionary algorithms, among others.
