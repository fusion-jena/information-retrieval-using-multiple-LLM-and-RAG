The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (train, test, validation). However, based on common practices in machine learning and deep learning, some possible criteria could be:

1. Random Split: This is a simple method where the dataset is randomly divided into three subsets - training, testing, and validation sets. The typical ratios used are 60-80% for training, 10-20% for testing, and 10-20% for validation.

2. Stratified Sampling: In this method, the dataset is first stratified by class labels, ensuring each subset has approximately the same percentage of samples from each target class as the complete set. Then, the stratified dataset is split into training, testing, and validation sets using random sampling.

3. Time-based Split: For time series datasets, it is more appropriate to use a time-based split instead of a random one. Here, the dataset is chronologically ordered, and then divided into training, testing, and validation sets based on specific timestamps.

4. Cross-validation: This technique involves splitting the dataset into k number of folds (subsets), where k-1 folds are used for training, and the remaining fold is used for validation. This process is repeated k times, such that each fold serves as the validation set once. Afterward, the average performance across all iterations can be calculated.

Without further information regarding the nature of the dataset or the specific task at hand, it is difficult to determine which criterion would be most suitable for splitting the data for deep learning model training.
