The text does not provide explicit information about specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it mentions some general steps taken during the process of creating training samples and extracting landscape types.

In the given context, the researchers generated 1800 sample points in the study area's image for each year, with 300 sample points for each land cover type. They imported these sample points into the Google Earth Engine (GEE) application programming interface (API) for further analysis. Then, they divided these samples into training and validation datasets at a 7:3 ratio. Finally, they applied the random forest algorithm to quickly classify the land use types in the study area.

Additionally, post-classification processing was performed on the images. Manual visual interpretation was employed to rectify the image classification outcomes for mangroves within a 10-km buffer zone stretching inland from the coastline. This method effectively addressed misclassifications between forests and mangroves due to spectral confusion.

Although these steps do not directly correspond to typical preprocessing techniques like normalization, scaling, or cleaning, they demonstrate essential stages in preparing data for training a deep learning model. These include generating sample points, importing them into an API, dividing them into training and validation sets, applying algorithms for classification, and manually refining the results when necessary.
