The dataset was split into three parts: 70% for training, 10% for testing, and 20% for validation. This means that out of the entire dataset, 70% of it was used to train the deep learning models, while 10% was used to evaluate the performance of the trained models during the development phase. The remaining 20% was used to validate the models after they had been fully developed. These percentages can vary depending on the specific requirements of the project or the preferences of the researchers.
