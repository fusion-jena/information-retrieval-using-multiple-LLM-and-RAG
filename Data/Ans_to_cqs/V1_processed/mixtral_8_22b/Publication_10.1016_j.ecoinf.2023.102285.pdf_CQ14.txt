The context does not provide explicit information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, it can be inferred that some form of optimization was performed due to the use of multiple cut-off points (17 in total) to find the optimum point. This suggests that either a grid search or a random search technique might have been used to determine the best set of hyperparameters. Unfortunately, without further details, we cannot definitively state which specific optimization method was employed.

The table presented in the context shows various performance metrics such as True Positives (TP), False Negatives (FN), True Negatives (TN), False Positives (FP), sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), and 1 - Sp for each cut-off point. These values indicate that different combinations of hyperparameters were tested to achieve optimal results. Nonetheless, the exact optimization process remains unclear based solely on this context.
