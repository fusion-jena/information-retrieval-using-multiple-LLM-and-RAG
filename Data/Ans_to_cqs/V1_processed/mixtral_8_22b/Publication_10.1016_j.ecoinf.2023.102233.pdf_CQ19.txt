The authors used PyTorch, an open-source machine learning library, to build their deep learning model. They specifically utilized a ResNet-34 model with pre-trained weights for the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. This choice was made due to the high performance of ResNet models in image and audio recognition tasks, as well as their wide application in automated wildlife image and call recognition.
