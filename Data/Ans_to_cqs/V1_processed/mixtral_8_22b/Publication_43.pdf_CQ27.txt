Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available in the given context to provide a detailed explanation about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, typically after training a deep learning model like ResNet or GoogLeNet, the next step would involve saving or serializing the model using popular libraries like TensorFlow's `tf.saved_model` or PyTorch's `torch.save`. This serialized model can then be loaded onto various platforms for further use. Commonly used platforms include cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, etc., or edge devices like NVIDIA Jetson boards, Intel Movidius sticks, etc. Again, without specific details regarding this particular model, it is not possible to give a more precise response.
