The provided context does not directly address the handling of randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide some general strategies used to manage randomness in this context.

Randomness in deep learning pipelines often arises from various sources like weight initialization, batch selection during training, dropout regularization, etc. To ensure reproducibility and consistency across experiments, several strategies are commonly employed:

1. **Fixed Random Seeds**: Setting a fixed random seed value for all random operations ensures that the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers will be generated each time the code runs. This helps in reproducing results consistently.

2. **Deterministic Algorithms**: Using deterministic algorithms instead of non-deterministic ones can help eliminate unpredictable behavior due to randomness. For example, using a deterministic algorithm for mini-batch generation can ensure consistent batches across different runs.

3. **Repeatability vs Reproducibility**: While repeatability refers to obtaining identical results when running the same code multiple times on the same machine, reproducibility means getting similar results when running the code on different machines or environments. Achieving perfect repeatability might not always be possible due to hardware differences, but efforts should be made towards achieving reproducible results.

4. **Documentation**: Properly documenting the software versions, libraries, and dependencies used in the project can help others reproduce the results accurately. Tools like Docker or Conda can be used to create isolated environments with specific package versions.
