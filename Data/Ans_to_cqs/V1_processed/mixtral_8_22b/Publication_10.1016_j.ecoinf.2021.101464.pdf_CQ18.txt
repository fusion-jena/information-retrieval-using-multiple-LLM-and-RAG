To monitor the model performance during training, the authors employed a 10-fold cross-validation technique using independent test data in the Random Forest (RF) model. This approach allowed them to evaluate the model's predictive power and generalization capabilities. By dividing the dataset into ten equal parts, they trained the model on nine folds while testing its performance on the remaining fold. They repeated this process until every fold had been used as the test set once. The results of this validation process are presented in Table 5, where the mean R2 value is reported as 0.931, and the mean root mean square error (RMSE) is given as 141.124 ion/cm3. These findings indicate that the RF model exhibits high simulation accuracy and good stability, thereby confirming its robustness and reliability.
