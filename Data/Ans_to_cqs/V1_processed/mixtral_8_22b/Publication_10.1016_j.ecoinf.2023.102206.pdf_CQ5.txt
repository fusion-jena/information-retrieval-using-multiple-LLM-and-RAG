Based on the given context, it appears that several datasets have been mentioned, but not all of them can be classified as being used in a deep learning pipeline. Some of the datasets mentioned include housing dataset, synthetic dataset, email spam filtering text dataset, Intel Berkeley dataset, de Montfort University Robotics dataset, Glutamic acid fermentation process modeling, multivalued (MV) data modeling, Brodatz texture, and others. However, none of these datasets are commonly associated with deep learning pipelines such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. It should be noted that the context does not explicitly mention any specific deep learning pipeline, so it cannot be determined if any of these datasets were used in such a pipeline.
