The method used for collecting raw data in the described deep learning pipeline is sampling flying insects with sticky traps. These traps are then covered with transparent acetate sheets. After this, high-resolution scanning of the traps is performed using an office scanner. The scanned images along with their metadata, such as time of placement and removal, location, and scanning resolution, are uploaded to the STARdbi database using its web interface. Automatic detection of insects in the images is carried out, and their positions are stored in the database. This process forms part of the STARdbi pipeline, which aims to facilitate large-scale surveys of species and biodiversity assessments by making both raw and processed data available to the entomological community and the general public.
