In the given context, two specific metrics are mentioned to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models - Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). These metrics are commonly used in regression tasks where the goal is to predict continuous values rather than classifying them into categories.

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): It measures the average magnitude of errors without considering their direction. In other words, it gives us an idea about how far our predictions are from the actual values. Lower values indicate better performance.

Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): Similar to MAE, RMSE also quantifies the difference between predicted and observed values. However, unlike MAE, RMSE squares the differences first before averaging them, which makes it sensitive to larger errors. Therefore, minimizing RMSE implies reducing both small and large deviations between predicted and actual values.

Additionally, Diebold-Mariano (DM) Test Statistics and P-Values are presented in Table 6 for comparing different forecasting models. The results show that the TPEBO-LSTM model consistently outperforms others with P-values below 0.05, confirming its superiority.
