To ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model, the authors utilized several strategies. Firstly, they employed a large and diverse dataset called Benthoz15, which contains expert-annotated and geo-referenced marine images from various locations across Australian seas. This dataset includes a wide range of labels, making it highly challenging but also comprehensive. Specifically, the authors focused on a subset of this dataset consisting of images from Western Australia (WA), totaling 4,750 images with 237,500 expert-annotated points.

Secondly, the authors fine-tuned the weights of their deep network using the Benthoz15 dataset. They utilized a pre-trained VGGnet and adjusted its weights according to the specific characteristics of the Benthoz15 dataset. By doing so, they aimed to improve the model's ability to accurately classify images within the marine environment.

Lastly, although not explicitly mentioned in the given context, it can be assumed that the authors likely implemented techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting during the training process. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into multiple folds and iteratively training the model on different combinations of these folds. This helps prevent overfitting and ensures that the model performs well on unseen data. Similarly, stratified splitting maintains the same distribution of classes in both the training and validation sets, further enhancing the model's robustness and generalization capabilities.
