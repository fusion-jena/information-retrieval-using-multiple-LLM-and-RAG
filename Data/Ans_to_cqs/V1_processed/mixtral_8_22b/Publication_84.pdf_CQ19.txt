The text does not provide explicit information on which specific frameworks were used to build the deep learning models. However, it mentions that the study uses deep learning, a branch of machine learning, and specifically employs the Stacked Autoencoder (SAE) method. Both TensorFlow and PyTorch support building deep learning models using stacked autoencoders. Therefore, either or both of these frameworks could potentially be used to implement the deep learning models mentioned in the study.
