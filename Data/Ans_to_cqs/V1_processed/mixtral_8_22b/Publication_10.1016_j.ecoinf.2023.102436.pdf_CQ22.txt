The given context does not provide information about the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model such as accuracy, precision, or recall. Instead, it discusses various aspects related to ecology and landscape analysis, including 3D spatial metrics, landscape volumetric ratios, naturalness, and other factors. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model based on the given context.
