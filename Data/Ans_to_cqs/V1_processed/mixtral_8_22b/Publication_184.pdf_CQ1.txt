Based on the given context, there isn't explicit mention of specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, some clues can be derived from the references mentioned. For instance, Li et al. (2019) discuss deep learning for hyperspectral image classification, which suggests that they might have used hyperspectral imagery as their source of raw data. Similarly, Lumauag and Nava (2019) focus on fish tracking and counting using IEEE conference papers, indicating that video or image data could be their primary sources of raw data. Furthermore, Figure 2 displays various fish samples under different environmental circumstances, implying that images were collected as part of the raw data.

While these examples do not directly address the collection methods, one can infer that common techniques such as cameras, sensors, or publicly available datasets may have been employed. Cameras and sensors are often used to gather visual or environmental data, while public datasets offer pre-existing collections of relevant data. Nonetheless, without more specific details regarding the data collection process, it remains uncertain what exact methods were utilized in this case.
