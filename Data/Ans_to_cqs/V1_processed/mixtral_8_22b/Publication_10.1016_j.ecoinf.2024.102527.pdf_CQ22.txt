The authors evaluated the performance of their deep learning model using the metric of accuracy. They compared the accuracy of the transfer learning model to that of the model trained from scratch. Specifically, they reported the accuracy of the transfer learning model on the test set after it had been trained on the training set and validated on the validation set. They also conducted a binomial test to determine if there was a significant difference between the best-performing transfer strategy and other transfer strategies. However, the authors did not report any other evaluation metrics such as precision or recall.
