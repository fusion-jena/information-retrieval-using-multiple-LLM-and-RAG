Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide a direct link to the data repository of the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context. However, based on the context, it appears that the authors used the AnnotationsActions dataset for their experiments, which was randomly split into a train set, validation set, and test set. Additionally, they utilized the official COCO evaluation metrics for evaluating their models. To find the specific data repository or any related links, I would recommend checking the original paper or contacting the authors directly.
