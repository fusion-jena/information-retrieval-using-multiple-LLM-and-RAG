The study uses stratified 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate the model generated during the training process. Stratified k-fold cross-validation is a variation of k-fold cross-validation where the folds are selected so that the mean response value is approximately equal in all the folds. In this case, the dataset is divided into ten subsets or 'folds'. Of these, nine folds are used for training the model, while one fold is kept aside for testing. This process is repeated ten times, such that each unique subset serves as the testing set once. The results from each run are averaged to produce a single estimation. The use of stratification ensures that each fold is a good representative of the whole dataset.

The performance metrics used to evaluate the model include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC score, confusion matrix, and model training time for both binary and multi-class classifications. These metrics help assess the model's ability to correctly classify mosquito species based on their wingbeat frequencies.
