The text does not provide explicit information about the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions that the models were evaluated based on their ability to replicate the statistics of the original data while offering significant runtime reductions. This suggests that monitoring the model performance might have involved comparing the output statistics with the original dataset and assessing computational efficiency. Additionally, the use of correlation scores and mean data quality scores implies that these metrics may also have been employed to track the progress and accuracy of the models during training.
