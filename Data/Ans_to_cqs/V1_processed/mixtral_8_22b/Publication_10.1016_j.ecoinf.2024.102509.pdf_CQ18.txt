The text does not provide explicit information about the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions that the 'neuralnet' package of R 4.1.2 software was considered for developing a Backpropagation Artificial Neural Network (BP-ANN) model. This package might include built-in functions or procedures to evaluate the model's performance during training. Additionally, the text suggests that the selection of hidden layers and neurons was determined through a process of trial and error, aiming to optimize the networkâ€™s structure. This implies that some form of monitoring and adjustment took place during the development of the BP-ANN model. Furthermore, the table presented shows various performance metrics such as Adjusted R^2, Mean Squared Error (MSE), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) for different regression methods including ANN. These metrics could be used to assess the model's performance during training. However, without more specific details, it cannot be definitively stated what exact strategy was employed to monitor the model performance during training.
