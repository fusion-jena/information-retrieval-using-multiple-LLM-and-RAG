The data was split into three mutually exclusive parts: a learning set, a validation set, and a test set. Four of the five areas were used for learning and validation, while the remaining isolated scene was used as the test set. This independent test set contained all the classes for both nomenclatures and represented various environments such as urban, mining, mountainous, and forest landscapes. The final confusion matrix and quality metrics were computed based on this entire scene.
