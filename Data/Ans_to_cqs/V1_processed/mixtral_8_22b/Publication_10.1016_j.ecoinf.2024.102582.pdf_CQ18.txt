The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves creating training samples and extracting landscape types using the random forest algorithm. Sample points are generated in the image of the study area for each year, which are then divided into training and validation datasets at a 7:3 ratio. After applying post-classification processing to the images, manual visual interpretation is used to correct any misclassifications between forest and mangroves due to spectral confusion. However, there is no specific mention of how the model performance is monitored or evaluated during training. It can be assumed that standard practices such as cross-validation or tracking metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score might have been employed.
