Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) being applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that a grid search was used to find the best number of trees (i.e., 500 trees) in the Random Forest algorithm, which is a type of ensemble learning method often used in machine learning pipelines. Grid search is a hyperparameter tuning technique that involves an exhaustive search through a manually specified subset of a hyperparameter space of a learning algorithm. It is often used with other optimization techniques like cross-validation to improve the performance of machine learning models. Therefore, while the context does not directly address the use of optimization techniques in the deep learning pipeline, it does suggest the application of optimization techniques in the broader machine learning process.
