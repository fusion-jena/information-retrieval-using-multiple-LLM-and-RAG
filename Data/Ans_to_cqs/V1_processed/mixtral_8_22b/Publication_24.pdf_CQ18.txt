The text does not provide explicit information about the specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), or deep learning models, were employed for the task. These types of models typically involve monitoring various metrics such as accuracy, loss, precision, recall, and F1 score during training to evaluate their performance. Additionally, techniques like cross-validation or validation sets may be utilized to ensure the generalizability of the trained models. Nonetheless, without further details regarding the implementation, we cannot definitively state which particular strategies were adopted for monitoring the model performance during training.
