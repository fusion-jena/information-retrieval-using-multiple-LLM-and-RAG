The data repository link of the deep learning pipeline can be found in reference number 25, which states "Naude J, Joubert D. The aerial elephant dataset: A new public benchmark for aerial object detection. In: Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition (CVPR) Workshops; 2019." However, this does not provide a direct link to the dataset.

To find the actual link to the dataset, we need to refer to reference number 22, which provides the DOI for the dataset: "22. Naud√© JJ, Joubert D. The aerial elephant dataset Zenodo. 2019. <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3234780>" This DOI leads us to the dataset hosted on Zenodo, which is a general-purpose open-access repository developed under the European OpenAIRE program and operated by CERN.

Therefore, the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline is <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3234780>.
