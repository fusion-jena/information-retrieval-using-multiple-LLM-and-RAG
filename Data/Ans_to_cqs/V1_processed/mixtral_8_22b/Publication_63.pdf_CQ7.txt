A random sample of 10% of the dataset of each trait was extracted before model training to serve as the 'test dataset'. This dataset was not involved in the training process and was exclusively used for the independent evaluation of the trained models. The remaining data was split into 'training dataset' and 'validation dataset' by a ratio of 4:1. The training dataset was employed to train the weights of the CNN model, whereas the validation dataset indicated the training progress after each full training cycle ('epoch'). The final model performance was assessed using a 3-fold cross-validation, with three different training, validation, and test splits. The same normalization scheme was undergone for the bioclimatic variables.
