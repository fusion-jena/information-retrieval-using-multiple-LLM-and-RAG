To monitor the model performance during training, an unbiased validation set comprising 20% of the current dataset's images was constructed for each training stage. These sets were designed to maintain a similar distribution of species and ensure independence by keeping images from the same transect grouped together. This approach aimed to prevent any performance bias related to the natural imbalance of species and any spatial bias related to the overlap of images. Additionally, the model relative to the epoch that gave the best performance on the validation set was selected at each training stage to avoid any risk of overfitting.
