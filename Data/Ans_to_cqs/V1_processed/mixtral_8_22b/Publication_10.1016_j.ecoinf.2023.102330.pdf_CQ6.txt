The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps taken before training the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for acoustic detection. However, it is generally understood that when working with audio data, some common preprocessing techniques include noise reduction, normalization, and feature extraction such as creating spectrograms or Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs). These techniques help prepare the raw audio data into a format suitable for inputting into a deep learning model like a CNN. It should be noted that these preprocessing steps might have been performed but were not mentioned in the given context.
