The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training process. However, it does provide some clues about possible postprocessing steps through the use of metrics such as UIQM, UCIQE, and NIQE in evaluating the performance of different models. These metrics suggest that there may be some form of quality assessment or scoring involved in the postprocessing stage. Additionally, the use of a discriminator network in the proposed dehazing model suggests that there could be some form of validation or verification step involved in the postprocessing stage. Overall, without explicit information regarding the postprocessing steps, we cannot definitively state what those steps might entail beyond speculation based on the available context.
