The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the LST dataset was derived from infrared radiations measured on channels 31 and 32 using the MODIS-TERRA sensor. This suggests that the data could be in a format suitable for satellite imagery or remote sensing data. Additionally, the context discusses the use of artificial neural networks, specifically the NARX model, for modeling and predicting vegetation biomass density. This implies that the input data might be numerical or tabular, such as CSV files containing relevant features for training the model. Nonetheless, without further details regarding the preprocessing steps or the exact nature of the input data, it is challenging to definitively determine the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline.
