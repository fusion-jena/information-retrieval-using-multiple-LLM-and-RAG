Based on the given context, there isn't any direct information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or setting a specific random seed value. However, I can provide some general strategies used to manage randomness in deep learning models:

1. Fixed Random Seed: One common strategy is to set a fixed random seed value before training the model. This ensures reproducibility by initializing the weights and biases of the neural network in the same way every time the code runs.

2. Cross-Validation: To reduce the impact of random initialization on the performance of the model, cross-validation techniques like K-fold cross-validation can be used. In this method, the dataset is divided into 'K' folds, and the model is trained and tested 'K' times, each time using a different fold as the test set.

3. Ensemble Methods: Another technique to mitigate the effects of randomness is ensemble methods. These involve combining multiple models, each initialized with different random seeds, to improve overall performance and robustness.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning: By tuning hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of layers, one can find optimal settings that minimize the effect of random initialization on the final results.

5. Data Augmentation: Applying various transformations to the input data during training can help expose the model to more variations, reducing its sensitivity to random initialization.
