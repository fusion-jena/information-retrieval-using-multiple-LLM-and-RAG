The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves splitting the bird song dataset into three parts: a training dataset, a validation dataset, and a testing dataset. The training dataset consists of 70% of the recordings for each species and country, while the remaining 30% is used for testing. Data augmentation is applied only to the training dataset, and the resulting segments are randomly distributed between the training and validation sets with a ratio of 0.8/0.2. The model is then trained for 40 epochs using a batch size of 8 segments and a learning rate of 0.001 with the Adam optimizer. This process is repeated ten times to account for the effects of random weight initialization in neural networks. During each execution, the model is applied to the testing dataset, and the confusion matrix, along with the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives, is recorded.
