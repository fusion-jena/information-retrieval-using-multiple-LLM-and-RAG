Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available from the given context to provide a detailed response about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, I can infer some general steps that might have been taken due to common practices in machine learning projects. After training the model with a batch size of 32 and applying early stopping to prevent overfitting, the model could be saved or serialized into a file format like.h5 (HDF5) if using Keras/TensorFlow. This allows the model to be reused later without retraining. For platform selection, depending on the project requirements, the model could be deployed on various platforms such as cloud services (like AWS, Google Cloud, Azure), edge devices, or even mobile applications. But again, these are assumptions based on typical ML workflows, not explicit details from the provided context.
