The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions some sources of data that could potentially be used in a deep learning pipeline. For instance, references to high-resolution multi-band imagery suggest that satellite or airborne sensors might be used to collect this type of data. Additionally, there are references to well-known annotated hyperspectral scenes like the Pavia University image and the Indian pines image, which implies that publicly available datasets may also serve as sources of raw data. Nonetheless, without more detailed information, it cannot be definitively stated what methods are specifically employed for gathering raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
