The calculations for the deep learning model were performed on an ASUS laptop equipped with an Intel i7-11370H CPU (4 cores, 3.30 GHz), 16 GB DDR4 memory, and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 graphics card (4 GB). Therefore, it can be concluded that the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model included a central processing unit (CPU), random access memory (RAM), and a graphics processing unit (GPU).
