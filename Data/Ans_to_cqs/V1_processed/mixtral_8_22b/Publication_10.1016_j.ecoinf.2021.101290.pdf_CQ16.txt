Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to provide a specific answer regarding the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau or other metrics. These details would typically depend on the specific machine learning model being trained and its intended use case. Commonly used criteria include reaching a certain number of epochs, achieving a desired level of accuracy or loss, or observing no further improvement in performance after several iterations. However, without more context about the particular models or techniques mentioned in the references, I cannot provide a definitive answer.
