To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the Water Quality (WQ) indicator data was split into training and testing datasets using an 80% and 20% ratio, respectively. This is a common practice in Machine Learning (ML) to prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to perform well on unseen data. Secondly, a total of 20 and 10 random sample locations were selected for the purposes of training and testing, respectively. This helps to ensure that the model can handle diverse scenarios and conditions. Lastly, the development and evaluation of the ML/AI models relied on a plethora of validation techniques, including cross-validation. Cross-validation is a systematic approach to model evaluation that is particularly valuable when dealing with limited datasets, helping to avoid overfitting and underfitting. These measures contribute to ensuring the generalizability of the deep learning model.
