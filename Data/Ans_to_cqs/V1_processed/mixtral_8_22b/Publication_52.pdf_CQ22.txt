The performance of the deep learning models in the given context is evaluated using several metrics such as Classification Accuracy (ACC), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Precision, Recall, F-Score, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC). These metrics are calculated for both the DELMF and SCNN classifiers across different datasets like mammals\_dataset and fishes\_dataset. Additionally, the Time taken by each classifier is also reported.

For instance, Table 2 shows the performance metrics for the mammals\_dataset, where DELMF achieves an accuracy of 92.18%, while SCNN scores 92.10%. Similarly, other metrics like RMSE, Precision, Recall, F-Score, and ROC are compared between the two classifiers. The same evaluation methodology is applied to the fishes\_dataset in Table 3.

In summary, the performance of the deep learning models is assessed using various metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F-score, ROC, and time. This comprehensive evaluation helps compare the effectiveness of different classifiers across multiple datasets.
