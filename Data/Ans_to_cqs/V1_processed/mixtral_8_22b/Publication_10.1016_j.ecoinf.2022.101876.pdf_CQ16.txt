The table does not provide information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete for a machine learning model. However, common criteria include observing a plateau or decrease in validation loss, improvement in accuracy, or reaching a predefined number of epochs or iterations. These criteria can vary depending on the type of model being trained and the specific requirements of the task.
