Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available from the given context to determine which specific hardware resources were used for training the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the study uses the HRNet model, which is a high-accuracy and stable model for semantic segmentation tasks. Additionally, it mentions that the study combines this with graphics processing software for proofreading. Given these details, we can infer that the study likely utilizes GPU resources for both training the HRNet model and performing graphics processing tasks. While not explicitly stated, it's also possible that the study could have employed additional hardware resources such as CPUs or even TPUs depending on their availability and requirements.
