Based on the given information, it cannot be determined what specific type of deep learning model was used in the pipeline. While the text mentions that various modeling techniques such as artificial neural networks and deep learning were employed, it does not provide details about the exact architecture or type of deep learning models utilized. Therefore, without additional context or information, we cannot determine whether a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Transformer, or another type of deep learning model was used in the pipeline.
