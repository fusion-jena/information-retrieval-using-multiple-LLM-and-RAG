The text does not provide explicit criteria for splitting data for deep learning model training. However, it mentions that the standard practice of withholding parts of the training data for validating a model often results in both training and testing data suffering from the same spatial and environmental biases. This suggests that when splitting data, it should be done in a way that avoids these biases. Additionally, the text implies that if prior knowledge of the biology of a species is integrated into a model, then using biased withheld data for validation might indicate reduced predictive performance. Therefore, when deciding how to split data, considerations should include avoiding spatial and environmental biases and ensuring that the validation data represents the niche and environmental parameters estimated by the integrated model.
