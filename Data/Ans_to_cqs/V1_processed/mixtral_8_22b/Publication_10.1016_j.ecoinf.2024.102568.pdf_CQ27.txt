Unfortunately, based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, including details about model serialization or platform selection. It primarily focuses on describing the LSTM model architecture, its training process, and evaluation metrics. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the deployment process of the trained deep learning model.
