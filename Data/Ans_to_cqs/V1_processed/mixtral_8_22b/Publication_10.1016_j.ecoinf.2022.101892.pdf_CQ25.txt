The text does not explicitly state the specific purpose or task of the deep learning model, but based on the information given, it can be inferred that the model is likely being used for image classification or regression tasks related to age estimation. This is because the authors mention using the model to estimate ages from facial images of pandas, and they discuss applying various techniques like transfer learning, fine-tuning, and feature extraction using popular architectures like VGG and ResNet. Additionally, they evaluate their models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), which is commonly used for evaluating regression problems. Therefore, while the exact purpose isn't stated, it appears that the deep learning model is being employed for estimating the ages of pandas based on their facial images.
