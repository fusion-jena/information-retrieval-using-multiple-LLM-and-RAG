In evaluating the performance of deep learning models, several metrics are commonly used. These include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the curve (AUC).

Accuracy measures the proportion of true results among the total number of cases examined. It is calculated as the ratio of correctly predicted observations to the total observations.

Precision, also known as positive predictive value, is the fraction of relevant instances among the retrieved instances. It is calculated as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives.

Recall, also known as sensitivity or true positive rate, is the fraction of relevant instances that were retrieved. It is calculated as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives.

The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. Therefore, this score takes both false positives and false negatives into account. It is calculated as two times the product of precision and recall divided by the sum of precision and recall.

Area Under Curve (AUC) refers to the measure of the ability of a binary classification model to distinguish between positive and negative classes. It is calculated using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, which plots True Positive Rate (TPR) vs False Positive Rate (FPR) at different classification thresholds.

These metrics provide insights into how well a deep learning model performs on unseen data. They help researchers understand if their model is overfitting or underfitting the training data, and whether it generalizes well to new data.
