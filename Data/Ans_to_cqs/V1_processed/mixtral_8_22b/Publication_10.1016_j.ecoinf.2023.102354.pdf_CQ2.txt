The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the study utilizes various climate indices such as SPEI, ENSO, NAO, AMO, PDO, IOD, Ni単o 1+2, Ni単o 3.0, Ni単o 3.4, Ni単o 4, NTA, STA, and ETA. These indices are typically represented as time series or gridded spatial data. Additionally, the study mentions datasets like TWS, SMS, and GWS, which could potentially be represented as numerical values or gridded spatial data. Therefore, it can be assumed that the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline might include CSV files for time series data and possibly NetCDF or other geospatial file formats for gridded spatial data. Nevertheless, without more specific details regarding the deep learning pipeline, it is impossible to definitively state the exact data formats employed.
