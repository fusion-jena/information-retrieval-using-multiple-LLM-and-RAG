Based on the given context, no explicit information about preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning is mentioned. However, it does mention image processing to generate a tabulated dataset, which suggests some form of preprocessing might have occurred. Unfortunately, without more details, I cannot provide a definitive list of preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model.
