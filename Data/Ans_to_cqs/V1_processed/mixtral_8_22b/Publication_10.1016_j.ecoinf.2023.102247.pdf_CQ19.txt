Based on the given information, it does not appear that any specific deep learning framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch was mentioned. Instead, the authors utilized the BIOMOD2 package in R for their ensemble modeling approach. This package provides various machine learning algorithms like Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) which were used to create the final ensembled model for each species. Therefore, based on the available context, there is no explicit mention of any deep learning framework being used.
