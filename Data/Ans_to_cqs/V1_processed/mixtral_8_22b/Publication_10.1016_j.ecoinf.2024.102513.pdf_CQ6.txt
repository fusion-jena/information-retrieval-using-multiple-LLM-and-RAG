Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps may be required depending on the nature of the dataset. These steps help improve the performance and accuracy of the model by preparing the data in a suitable format. Some common preprocessing techniques include:

1. Data Cleaning: This step involves removing or correcting erroneous, missing, or inconsistent data points within the dataset. This ensures that the model learns from accurate and reliable data.

2. Normalization/Scaling: Deep learning models often work better when all input features have similar scales. Techniques like Min-Max Scaling, Z-Score Normalization, or Log Transformation can be used to rescale feature values between a specific range (usually 0 to 1 or -1 to 1).

3. Feature Selection/Extraction: Selecting relevant features or creating new ones from existing features can significantly impact the model's performance. Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), or other dimensionality reduction methods can be employed to identify important features.

4. Data Augmentation: To increase the size of the dataset and prevent overfitting, synthetic samples can be generated by applying transformations like rotation, flipping, zooming, etc., to the original data.

5. Splitting Dataset: Dividing the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets is crucial for evaluating the model's performance during and after training. A typical split might involve allocating 70% of the data for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing.
