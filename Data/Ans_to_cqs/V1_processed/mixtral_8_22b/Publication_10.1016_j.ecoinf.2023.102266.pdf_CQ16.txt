The provided context does not directly discuss any criteria for determining when training is complete. However, based on general practices in machine learning, some common criteria include observing a plateau or decrease in validation loss over several epochs, achieving a predefined target metric value, or reaching a maximum number of training iterations. In this context, the authors mention improving their model by modifying the update criterion while maintaining stochasticity, which suggests they might use a customized stopping condition related to their specific problem and model requirements.
