The given context does not provide any specific details about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the context focuses on research papers related to machine learning applications in geology and soil science. These studies use different types of data, including soil class predictions in semi-arid landscapes, sampling methods for validating digital soil maps, supervised and unsupervised classification techniques for marine benthic habitat mapping, and covariance-weighted bagging for reducing bias in machine learning models with clustered data. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline based on the given context.
