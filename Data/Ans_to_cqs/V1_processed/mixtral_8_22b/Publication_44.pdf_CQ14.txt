The text does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the models were optimized. However, there are some clues regarding the optimization of certain aspects of the models. For instance, in the case of Faster R-CNN, the authors mention using a learning rate of 0.001 and a momentum of 0.9. They also state that the model was trained for 3000 iterations, and the best performing model based on validation loss was saved and used for testing. Similarly, for YOLOv5s, the authors mention using a batch size of 16 and a learning rate of 0.001. However, these details do not explicitly indicate whether techniques such as grid search or random search were employed for hyperparameter optimization. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively determine which method was used for hyperparameter optimization.
