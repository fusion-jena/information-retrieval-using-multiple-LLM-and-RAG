The text does not provide explicit details about the strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, there are some indications regarding the overall goal and challenges faced while developing the model.

In section 7.1.3., the authors mention their intention to create bespoke neural networks for specific species sets. This implies that they aim to tailor models based on the target species present in the area where the camera trap will be deployed. To accomplish this, further research is required to develop a process that generates a robust and reliable neural network model with appropriate weights when given a set of species of interest.

Additionally, in sections 6.2. and 6.2.1., the authors discuss benchmarking the system using various configurations and comparing them against existing machine learning approaches. They also acknowledge the lack of datasets containing full videos with corresponding Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor information, making it challenging to evaluate the system comprehensively. Due to these limitations, manual production of such data has been carried out on a smaller scale to guide development rather than creating a large-scale robust test set.

Based on these points, one could infer that the monitoring strategy might involve evaluating the model's performance through comparisons with other machine learning methods and assessing its effectiveness in handling bespoke species sets. However, without more detailed information, it remains unclear what specific metrics or techniques were employed to track progress during training.
