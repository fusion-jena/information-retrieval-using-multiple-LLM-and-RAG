The piece of context does not directly address the issue of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, specifically regarding random seed values. However, I can still provide some general information about this topic.

Randomness in deep learning pipelines often comes from sources like weight initialization, shuffling of training examples, dropout regularization, etc. Random seeds are used to control these sources of randomness so that experiments can be reproduced.

To handle randomness, one common strategy is to fix the random seed before running any code involving random operations. This ensures that every run will produce identical results, making comparisons easier and debugging simpler. Another approach is to use multiple runs with different random seeds and then average the results. This helps to mitigate the effects of individual bad initializations or unfavorable shuffles.

Additionally, some libraries offer deterministic modes where they attempt to eliminate all sources of non-determinism. For example, TensorFlow has a tf.config.experimental.enable_op_determinism() function that makes certain ops behave consistently across runs.

However, it should be noted that eliminating all randomness might not always be desirable. Some amount of randomness can help prevent overfitting and aid in exploring the solution space during optimization. Therefore, finding a balance between controlling randomness and allowing enough variability is crucial.
