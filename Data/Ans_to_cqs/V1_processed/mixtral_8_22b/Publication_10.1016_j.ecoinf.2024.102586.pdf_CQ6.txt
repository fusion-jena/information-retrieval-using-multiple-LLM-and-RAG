Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be taken to ensure optimal performance. These may include data cleaning, where missing or irrelevant values are removed or replaced; normalization, which scales numeric variables to a common range for better comparison; and feature scaling, which standardizes features with varying scales so they contribute equally during training. Other techniques like one-hot encoding can also be used to convert categorical variables into numerical form suitable for machine learning algorithms. However, it is important to note that not all these steps are necessary for every dataset, and some might even introduce bias if applied incorrectly. Therefore, careful consideration should be given when deciding on what preprocessing steps to apply based on the specific characteristics of the dataset being used.

Based on the provided context, there isn't any direct information about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, generally speaking, preprocessing steps could involve data cleaning, normalization, scaling, and other transformations depending on the nature of the data. In this case, since we have two distinct groups - native and alien species - it would be beneficial to separate them first. After separation, further processing might include removing any irrelevant or redundant data points, normalizing the remaining data, and possibly converting categorical data into numerical format using methods like one-hot encoding. But remember, without more specific details about the intended deep learning model and its requirements, these suggestions remain generalized assumptions.
