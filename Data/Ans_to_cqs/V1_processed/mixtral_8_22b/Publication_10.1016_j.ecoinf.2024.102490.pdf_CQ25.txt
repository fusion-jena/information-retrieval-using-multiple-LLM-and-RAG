The text does not explicitly state the purpose of the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the model is likely used for binary classification based on the use of the Area Under Curve (AUC) of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) as a metric for evaluating its performance. ROC curves are typically used to visualize the performance of binary classifiers. Additionally, the True Skill Statistics (TSS) metric is also mentioned, which is another common measure used to evaluate the performance of binary classifiers. Therefore, it can be assumed that the deep learning model is being used for binary classification purposes.
