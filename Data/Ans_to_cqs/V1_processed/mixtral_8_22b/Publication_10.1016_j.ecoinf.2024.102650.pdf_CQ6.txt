Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved. These may include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization involves rescaling the input features so they fall within a specific range, often between 0 and 1. This helps prevent certain features from dominating others due to their scale. Scaling is another technique used to standardize the range of independent variables or features of data. It brings all features to the same level of magnitude, ensuring no single feature overpowers the others during the learning process. Cleaning is a crucial step that involves removing irrelevant information, correcting inconsistencies, handling missing data, and eliminating duplicates. In the given context, data cleaning for tweets includes text filtering and Chinese text segmentation. Text filtering removes unnecessary symbols and noise, while Chinese text segmentation divides the natural language into meaningful words, which is essential for text analysis.
