The provided context does not directly discuss regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. Instead, it focuses on various techniques and studies related to improving Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) reconstruction and long-term vegetation cover analysis. However, I can provide some information about these regularization methods.

Dropout is a commonly used regularization technique in deep learning pipelines. It involves randomly dropping out neurons during training, which helps prevent overfitting by making the network more robust and less sensitive to individual neuron activations.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. This encourages smaller weights, leading to simpler models and reducing the risk of overfitting.

Other popular regularization techniques include L1 regularization, early stopping, and batch normalization. Each has its own advantages and use cases depending on the specific problem and architecture being employed.
