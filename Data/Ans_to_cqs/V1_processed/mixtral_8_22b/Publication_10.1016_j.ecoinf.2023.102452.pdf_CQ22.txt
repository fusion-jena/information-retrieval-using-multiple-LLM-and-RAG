The statistical performance results of the forecasting models mentioned in the given context include Mean Error Ensemble (MEE), Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), and Standard Deviation (St.dev). These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models.

Mean Error Ensemble (MEE): It measures the average error between predicted and actual values. Lower values indicate better performance.

Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE): This metric compares the predictive power of the model against a naïve model that always predicts the mean value of the observed data. An NSE value close to 1 indicates good performance, while a value below zero suggests that the model performs worse than the naïve model.

Standard Deviation (St.dev): It measures the dispersion or spread of the errors around the mean error. Lower values suggest more consistent predictions.

These metrics help assess the overall performance, accuracy, and consistency of the deep learning models.
