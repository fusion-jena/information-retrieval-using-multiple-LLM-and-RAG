Unfortunately, there is no explicit mention or description of the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model in the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide specific details about the deployment process such as model serialization or platform selection. However, some general steps involved in deploying a deep learning model include saving the trained model using a format like TensorFlow's SavedModel or PyTorch's torch.save(), selecting a suitable platform for hosting the deployed model (like AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, etc.), setting up the necessary infrastructure, and finally integrating the saved model into the application or service where it will be utilized.
