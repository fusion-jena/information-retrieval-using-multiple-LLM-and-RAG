The given context does not provide specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that deep learning models generally require substantial datasets to achieve optimal results [Wu et al., 2021; Khruschev et al., 2022]. Commonly used datasets in deep learning include MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet, among others. These datasets are widely recognized and have been extensively used in various research studies and applications. Nevertheless, without explicit mention in the provided context, it cannot be confirmed which specific datasets were utilized in the deep learning pipeline discussed.
