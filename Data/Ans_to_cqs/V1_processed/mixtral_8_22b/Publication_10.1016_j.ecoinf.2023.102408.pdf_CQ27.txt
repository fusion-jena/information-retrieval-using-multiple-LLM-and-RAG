Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available in the given context to provide a detailed explanation about how the trained deep learning model was deployed. However, we can infer from the text that the researchers used various machine learning techniques like Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine to develop their models. They also mentioned using a stratified sampling method to allocate 70% of the samples to the training dataset and the remaining 30% to the validation dataset.

To evaluate the performance of these models, they utilized three error statistics - RÂ², Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). After evaluating the models, they were likely extrapolated for the entire region. However, the specific details regarding the deployment process, including model serialization or platform selection, are not explicitly stated in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide a more precise answer without additional information.
