Unfortunately, there is no explicit information given about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into sets such as train, test, and validation. However, common practices include splitting the dataset randomly or stratified based on class labels. The typical ratios used are 70/30, 80/20, or 60/20/20 for train, test, and validation respectively. It is also important to note that the choice of splitting ratio depends on various factors such as the size of the dataset, computational resources, and the complexity of the problem being addressed.
