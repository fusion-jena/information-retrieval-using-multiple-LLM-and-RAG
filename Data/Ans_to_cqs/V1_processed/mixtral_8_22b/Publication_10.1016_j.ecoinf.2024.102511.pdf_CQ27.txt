The provided context does not contain specific information about the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. However, common practices for deploying such models include model serialization, platform selection, and version control.

Model serialization involves converting the trained model into a format that can be easily stored or transferred between different systems. This often includes saving the model architecture, weights, and any other relevant parameters. Common formats for this include.pkl files in Python or.h5 files in TensorFlow.

Platform selection refers to choosing where to run the deployed model. This could be on a local machine, a server, or even in the cloud. The choice depends on factors like computational requirements, cost, and accessibility.

Version control is important to keep track of changes made to the model during development and after deployment. Tools like Git can help manage different versions of the code and ensure reproducibility.

Without more specific details from the given context, it is impossible to provide a precise description of the deployment process used for the trained deep learning model.
