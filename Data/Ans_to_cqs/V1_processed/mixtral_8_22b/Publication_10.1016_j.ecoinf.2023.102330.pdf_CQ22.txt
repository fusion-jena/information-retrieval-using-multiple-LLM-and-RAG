The text does not explicitly mention specific metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does indicate that a conservative score threshold of 0.95 was chosen for classifying positive bobwhite detections, which suggests that some form of classification evaluation metric was employed. Furthermore, the manual review of CNN detections from a random sample of five one-hour files from each year aimed to evaluate model accuracy and calculate a false positive rate. This implies that the authors considered both correct and incorrect classifications when assessing the model's performance. Therefore, while the exact metrics may not be specified, we can infer that the authors evaluated the model's performance by considering its ability to correctly identify true positives and minimize false positives.
