The text does not provide explicit information about how the data was split for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, it mentions that the app collected metadata on location, number of dives, and number of divers, which suggests that these factors might have been considered when splitting the data. It also states that basic statistical analysis was performed on the crowdsourced data, but it doesn't specify if any machine learning techniques were applied. Therefore, without further context, we cannot determine the exact criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training.
