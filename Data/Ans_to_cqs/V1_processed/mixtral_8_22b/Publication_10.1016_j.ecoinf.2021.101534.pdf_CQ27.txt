Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available in the given context to provide a detailed explanation about how the trained deep learning model was deployed. The text only discusses the specifications of the workstation used for training the model, such as its CPUs, GPUs, memory, and storage. It does not mention any details regarding the deployment process, like model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful response based on the given context.
