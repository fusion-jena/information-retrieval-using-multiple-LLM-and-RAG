The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the studies mentioned use various types of data related to animal behavior and movement patterns. For instance, Brewster et al. (2018) classified the behaviors of lemon sharks using accelerometer (ACC) data. Other sources may include GPS or telemetry data, which could be stored in formats such as CSV files or databases. It is important to note that the choice of data format depends on the nature of the problem being addressed and the type of information required for analysis. Therefore, without additional context, it is difficult to determine the exact data formats used in these studies.
