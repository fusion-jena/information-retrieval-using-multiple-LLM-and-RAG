The text does not explicitly state the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it mentions that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been used for tasks such as predicting whether an image is empty and identifying animals in images. Therefore, it can be inferred that CNNs might be part of the pipeline, but without explicit confirmation, we cannot definitively say that they are the only type of deep learning model used.
