The given context does not provide information on any specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotation, scaling, etc. Instead, it discusses various aspects related to machine learning models, including hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation, and the use of libraries like Lazy Predict in Python. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based on the given context regarding the application of data augmentation techniques in a deep learning pipeline.
