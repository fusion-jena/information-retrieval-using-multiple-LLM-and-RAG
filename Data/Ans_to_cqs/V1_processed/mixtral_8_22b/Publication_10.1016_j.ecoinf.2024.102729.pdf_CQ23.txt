The study mentioned in the given context does not provide explicit details about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model. However, it does mention using a dataset that was randomly divided into two subsets, with 75% of the data devoted to model training and 25% to testing. This suggests that some form of cross-validation or holdout method might have been employed to assess the model's performance on unseen data. Additionally, the use of random sampling instead of cluster sampling indicates an attempt to maintain the covariance structure among the predictor variables relatively intact between the training and testing datasets. While these practices are common in ensuring the generalizability of machine learning models, without further context, it cannot be confirmed if other measures such as diverse datasets or stratified splitting were also implemented.
