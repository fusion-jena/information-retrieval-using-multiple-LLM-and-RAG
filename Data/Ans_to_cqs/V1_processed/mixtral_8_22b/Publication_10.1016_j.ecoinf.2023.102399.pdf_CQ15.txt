The paper does not provide specific information about the optimization techniques used in their deep learning pipeline. The authors mention using a deep learning network for high-quality target detection but do not specify which optimizer was employed during training. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if they used optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam).
