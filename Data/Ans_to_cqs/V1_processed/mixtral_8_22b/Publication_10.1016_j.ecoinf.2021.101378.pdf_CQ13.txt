Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. The context mentions the use of machine learning methods like artificial neural networks, random forests, and maximum entropy modeling but does not provide details regarding the hyperparameters used in these models. Therefore, without additional context or information, we cannot determine the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
