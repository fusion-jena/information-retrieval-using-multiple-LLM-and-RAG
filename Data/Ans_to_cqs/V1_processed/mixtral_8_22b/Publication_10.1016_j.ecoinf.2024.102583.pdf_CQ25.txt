The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the deep learning models mentioned, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN), could potentially be used for various purposes including image classification, object detection, or semantic segmentation. The specific purpose of these models would depend on the task they are being applied to, which in this case appears to be related to landslide susceptibility mapping. Without further context, it cannot be definitively determined what the exact purpose of the deep learning models is.
