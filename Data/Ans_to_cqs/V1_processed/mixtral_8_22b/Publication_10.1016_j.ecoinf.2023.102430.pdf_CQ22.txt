The authors evaluated the performance of their deep learning model, AlexNet (AN), along with other machine learning algorithms, using two main metrics: identification accuracy and specificity. These metrics were assessed using logit-binomial generalized linear mixed models fit in a Bayesian framework. However, the paper does not explicitly mention the use of other common evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, or F1 score. It is important to note that different applications may require different evaluation metrics based on the problem's nature and requirements. In this study, the focus seems to be primarily on overall accuracy and specificity to determine the best performing algorithm for identifying triatomine bugs.
