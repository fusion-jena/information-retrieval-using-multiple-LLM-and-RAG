The information provided does not directly address the postprocessing steps involved after model training such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices. However, based on general machine learning practices, some common postprocessing steps include:

1. Model evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the trained model using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves, etc.

2. Hyperparameter tuning: Adjusting hyperparameters to improve the model's performance by performing techniques like Grid Search, Randomized Search, Bayesian Optimization, etc.

3. Feature importance: Identifying which features contribute most significantly towards predicting the target variable. Techniques like permutation feature importance, SHAP values, etc., can help determine this.

4. Visualizing results: Creating visualizations like confusion matrices, ROC curves, lift charts, gain charts, etc., to better understand the model's performance and behavior.

5. Saliency maps: Generating heatmaps highlighting important regions within input images that influence predictions, often used in computer vision tasks.

However, these steps might vary depending upon the specific use case and requirements.
