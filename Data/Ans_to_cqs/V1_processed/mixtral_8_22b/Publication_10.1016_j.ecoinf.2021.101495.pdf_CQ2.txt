The information provided does not explicitly state what specific data format is used in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer that the primary data format used is likely image files since the study focuses on fish segmentation and classification tasks using deep neural networks. Additionally, the paper mentions using the ImageNet dataset, which consists mainly of labeled images, further supporting the assumption that the primary data format used is images.
