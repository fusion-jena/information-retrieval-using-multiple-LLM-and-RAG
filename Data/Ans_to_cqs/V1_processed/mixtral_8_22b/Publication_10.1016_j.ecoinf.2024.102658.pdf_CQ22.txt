The performance of the machine learning models in this study is evaluated using two main metrics: Area Under the Curve (AUC) and Maximum Attainable True Skill Statistic (TSS). These metrics are used instead of traditional ones like accuracy, precision, or recall due to the specific nature of the problem being addressed.

Area Under the Curve (AUC) is a metric derived from Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, which plot the true positive rate against the false positive rate at various classification thresholds. AUC provides an aggregate measure of the model's ability to distinguish between classes across different threshold settings. It ranges from 0 to 1, where a value closer to 1 indicates better performance.

Maximum Attainable True Skill Statistic (TSS) is another metric used to evaluate the performance of binary classifiers. It combines information about correctly predicted positives (true positives) and negatives (true negatives) into a single score. TSS ranges from -1 to 1, where a value close to 1 signifies excellent performance, while a value near zero suggests no discrimination capacity, and negative values imply worse than random guessing.

These metrics are chosen because they provide robust measures of model performance, especially when dealing with imbalanced data or varying threshold levels. They also help avoid potential biases introduced during the supervised feature selection process employed in this study.
