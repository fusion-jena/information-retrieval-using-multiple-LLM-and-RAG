The text does not provide specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, common practices in machine learning include monitoring metrics such as validation loss, accuracy, or other relevant measures during training. When these metrics reach a plateau or stop improving significantly, it may indicate that further training will not yield substantial improvements, suggesting that training can be stopped. It is important to note that the choice of stopping criterion depends on the specific problem, model architecture, and available resources.
