Based on the given context, it appears that the authors utilized image datasets collected by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and SPOT satellite equipment for their deep learning pipeline. However, specific details about these datasets, such as their names or sources, were not mentioned in the provided information. Therefore, I cannot provide exact dataset names like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The focus of this research seems to be on applying deep learning models, specifically the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model, to categorize forest types and improve fire risk prediction models.
