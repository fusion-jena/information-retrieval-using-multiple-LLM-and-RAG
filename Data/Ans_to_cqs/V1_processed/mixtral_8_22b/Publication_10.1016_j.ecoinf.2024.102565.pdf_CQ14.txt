The text does not explicitly mention the method used for optimizing the hyperparameters of the model. However, it does state that during model fitting, hyperparameters are determined from the data using methods such as maximum likelihood estimation or Bayesian approaches. These methods can be used to find optimal values for the hyperparameters based on the given data. Grid search and random search are common techniques used for hyperparameter optimization, but they are not mentioned specifically in this context. Therefore, without additional information, it cannot be definitively stated which method was used for hyperparameter optimization in this case.
