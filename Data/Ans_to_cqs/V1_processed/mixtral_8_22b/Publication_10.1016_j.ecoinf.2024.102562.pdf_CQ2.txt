Based on the given context, it appears that the study primarily focuses on utilizing images for their deep learning pipeline. Specifically, they mention using multiply, linear contrast, sharpen, emboss, flip in horizontal and vertical directions, rotations, and affine transformations for heavy augmentation. This suggests that the input data format for this particular deep learning pipeline is likely image data. However, there is no explicit mention of other data formats like audio, video, or CSV being used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, based on the available context, it can be concluded that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data.
