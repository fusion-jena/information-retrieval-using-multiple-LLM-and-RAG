The context does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, common practices include splitting the dataset into three subsets: a training set, a validation set, and a testing set. The training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting during the training process. Finally, the testing set is used to evaluate the final model's performance after it has been trained and validated. The proportions of these splits can vary depending on the specific application or dataset, but a common choice is 60% for training, 20% for validation, and 20% for testing.
