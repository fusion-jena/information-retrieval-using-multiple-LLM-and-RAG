In the given context, one regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline is L2 regularization. Also known as Ridge Regression or Weight Decay, L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages large weights in the model. In the case of the TPEBO-LSTM model mentioned in the context, the L2 regularization parameter is denoted by λ, where λ > 0. The larger the value of λ, the stronger the penalty imposed on the weights, thus reducing the risk of overfitting. Additionally, the search range for the L2 regularization parameter is set between 1e-2 and 1e-10, ensuring a balanced tradeoff between preventing overfitting and maintaining good predictive power. Other common regularization methods include Dropout and L1 regularization, although they are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
