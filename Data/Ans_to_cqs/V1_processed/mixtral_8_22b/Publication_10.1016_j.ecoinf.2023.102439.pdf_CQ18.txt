The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves utilizing various statistical metrics such as Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE), Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and correlation coefficient (R). These metrics help measure the deviation between the predicted Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) values and the actual observed values, providing insights into the accuracy and predictive capability of the model. Additionally, the study employs a hybrid model called W-ANN, which improves learning success and enhances predictive capabilities. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model used in this study consists of an input, hidden, and output layer. The input layer includes three processing elements or neurons corresponding to Land Surface Temperature (LST), temperature, and precipitation parameters. The EVI data serves as the output layer. To optimize the network's performance, the number of neurons in the hidden layer is gradually increased until the best results are achieved. Tables 3 and 4 present the comparison of the MSE and R values of the number of neurons in the ANN system and the ANN Model performance for Iznik and Alanya, respectively.
