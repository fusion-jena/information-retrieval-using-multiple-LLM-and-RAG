Regularization methods are commonly employed in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting and improve model generalizability. Two popular regularization techniques include dropout and L2 regularization. Dropout involves randomly setting a fraction of input or hidden units to zero during training, which helps reduce co-dependencies between neurons and encourages more robust features. This method was introduced by Srivastava et al. (2014) and has since become a standard practice in many deep learning architectures. On the other hand, L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of weights, effectively shrinking them towards zero. This technique discourages large weight values and promotes simpler models, thus reducing overfitting. Other forms of regularization such as L1 regularization, early stopping, and batch normalization also exist but were not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
