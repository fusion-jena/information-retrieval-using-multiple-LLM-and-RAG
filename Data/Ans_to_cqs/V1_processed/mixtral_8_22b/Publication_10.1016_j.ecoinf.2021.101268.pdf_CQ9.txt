The paper does not explicitly mention the exact location or platform where the Peruvian Amazon Forestry Dataset used in their deep learning pipeline is publicly available. However, considering the common practices in academia and research, it would be reasonable to assume that the authors have made the dataset accessible through one of the popular repositories like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. To find out the precise location, I recommend checking the original source paper or reaching out directly to the authors for more information.
