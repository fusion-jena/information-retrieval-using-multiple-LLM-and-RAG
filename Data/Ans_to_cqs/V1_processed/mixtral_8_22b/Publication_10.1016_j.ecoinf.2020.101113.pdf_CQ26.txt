In the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection being employed to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some relevant points can still be discussed.

Firstly, the authors acknowledge the need for equal-sized input images for their chosen Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. They opt for a time-frequency input window size of 2 seconds, which is close to the average duration of target call types. This decision might help mitigate potential biases related to varying durations of different call types.

Secondly, they discuss the possibility of introducing recurrent connections into the CNN or making other architectural modifications to accommodate the large variability in the size of target calls. These adjustments could potentially minimize negative impacts caused by fixed window sizes.

Thirdly, the authors touch upon the use of data augmentation, specifically noise addition, to enhance performance. Data augmentation has proven beneficial in previous studies where training data primarily consisted of unidirectional recordings of individual species. It helps simulate real-world soundscape recording conditions. However, its effectiveness might diminish when dealing directly with soundscape recordings, like in this study. Nevertheless, data augmentation remains crucial for expanding the training data size for infrequent species.

Lastly, the text mentions the utilization of transfer learning via models pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. Despite ImageNet containing no spectrograms, models trained on it acquire various image features applicable to spectrogram classification. Previous works have demonstrated successful adaptation of these models for spectrogram classification tasks.

However, none of these strategies explicitly addresses data bias through techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, without additional information, I cannot provide a more detailed response regarding the application of these specific techniques in the described scenario.
