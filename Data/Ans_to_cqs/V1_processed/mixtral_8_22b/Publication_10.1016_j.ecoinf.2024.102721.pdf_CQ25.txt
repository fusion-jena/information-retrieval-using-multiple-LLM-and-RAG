The paper discusses the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a type of deep learning model derived from Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), for forecasting ecological water demand in an arid oasis under a drying climate scenario. The primary purpose of using this deep learning model is not explicitly stated but can be inferred as time series prediction or regression, given its application in predicting future values based on historical data. This is further supported by the statement that LSTM can effectively learn in long time sequences and is well-suited for time series prediction. Therefore, it can be concluded that the main objective of employing the LSTM model in this study is to accurately forecast the ecological water demand over time.
