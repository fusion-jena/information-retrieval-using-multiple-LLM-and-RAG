The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred that the deep learning model, specifically a convolutional neural network, was used for automatic recognition of woody regrowth vegetation in repeat landscape photographs by Bayr and Puschmann (2019). This suggests that the primary purpose of this deep learning model is likely related to object detection or segmentation tasks in the field of computer vision.
