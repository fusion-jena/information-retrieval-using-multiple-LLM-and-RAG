Based on the given context, there isn't explicit mention of specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning prior to training the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that some level of preprocessing might have occurred due to the use of transfer learning and the application of a pretrained ResNet-34 architecture.

Transfer learning typically involves utilizing a pretrained model on a new task by fine-tuning the weights learned during the initial training phase. In this scenario, the authors leveraged the pretrained ResNet-34 architecture, which suggests that they may not have needed extensive preprocessing since the model had already been exposed to a large dataset (ImageNet).

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a Convolutional Autoencoder for feature extraction and noise reduction. This implies that the raw data could have gone through some transformation before being fed into the deep learning model. However, without further details about the exact preprocessing steps taken, it cannot be definitively stated what specific techniques were employed.
