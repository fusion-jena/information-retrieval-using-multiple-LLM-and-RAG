The given context does not provide information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, or validation sets. However, common practices include splitting the data randomly, stratified sampling based on class distribution, or using temporal or spatial splits depending on the nature of the data. It is important to ensure that the splits maintain similar distributions of classes or features to avoid bias during training and evaluation.

Based on the context, it can be inferred that the authors might have followed standard practices for splitting the data, but without explicit mention, the exact method remains unknown.
