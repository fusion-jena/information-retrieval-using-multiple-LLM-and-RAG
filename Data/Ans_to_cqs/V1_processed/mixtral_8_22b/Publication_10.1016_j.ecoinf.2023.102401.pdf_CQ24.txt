The paper does not explicitly discuss strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, common practices in machine learning research involve setting fixed seeds or reporting results across multiple runs with varying seeds to ensure consistency and reliability. Additionally, some researchers use techniques like cross-validation or bootstrap sampling to mitigate the impact of random initialization on model performance.
