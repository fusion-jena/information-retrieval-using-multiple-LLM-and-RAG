The provided context does not contain information about any specific deep learning models or their development, including details regarding measures taken to ensure the generalizability of such models. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate response based solely on this context.

Based on the provided context, it appears that the authors are discussing environmental data processing steps, specifically focusing on data filtering and scaling. They mention using sequential processes within Google Earth Engine (GEE) for scaling up environmental time series from one spatial and/or temporal scale to another during data extraction. However, there is no reference to any deep learning models or techniques used for modeling purposes. Consequently, I am unable to determine what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, as none are mentioned in the provided text.
