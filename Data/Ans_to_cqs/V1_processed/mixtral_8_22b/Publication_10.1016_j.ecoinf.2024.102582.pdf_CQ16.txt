The table provides information on the user's accuracy, total accuracy, and Kappa coefficients for the landscape classification results for different years. However, it does not provide any specific criteria or metrics used to determine when training is complete during the random forest algorithm application process. Therefore, based solely on this table, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the criteria used to determine when training is complete. Typically, common criteria include reaching a certain number of iterations, achieving a desired level of performance (such as minimizing validation loss), or observing no significant improvement after several iterations. However, without additional context or information, I can only speculate about the specific criteria used in this case.
