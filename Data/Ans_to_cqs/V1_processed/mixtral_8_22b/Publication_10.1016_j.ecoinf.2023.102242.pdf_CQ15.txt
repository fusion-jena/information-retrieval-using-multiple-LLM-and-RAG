The given context does not provide information on specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), which are commonly used in deep learning pipelines. However, it discusses an optimization technique applied during the data processing and classification phase.

In this case, the optimization technique involves selecting the optimal feature combination from the training samples within a hierarchical structure. This is done to minimize data redundancy and enhance classification accuracy and efficiency. This method can be seen as a form of feature selection or dimensionality reduction, which are common optimization techniques used in machine learning and deep learning pipelines.

However, without more specific details about the algorithm or method used for this feature selection process, it is impossible to directly compare it to optimization techniques like SGD or Adam. These techniques are typically used during the model training phase to optimize the weights and biases of a neural network, while the discussed technique is applied during the preprocessing and classification stages.
