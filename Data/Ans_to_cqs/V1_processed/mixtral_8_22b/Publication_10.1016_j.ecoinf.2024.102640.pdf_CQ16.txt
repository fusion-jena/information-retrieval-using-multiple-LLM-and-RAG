The text does not provide explicit information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions that after training, the model fits well with an R2 score of 0.95. This suggests that the performance of the model during training might be evaluated using metrics such as R2 scores, and training could be considered complete once the desired level of performance is achieved. Additionally, the text mentions the use of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function and the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001 during training. These details suggest that the training process likely involves monitoring the MSE loss and adjusting the model parameters using the Adam optimizer until satisfactory results are obtained. It is common practice in machine learning to monitor the validation loss during training and consider training complete when the validation loss reaches a plateau or starts increasing, indicating overfitting. However, this specific criterion is not explicitly mentioned in the given text.
