Unfortunately, there is no information available regarding the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipelines mentioned in the given context. The papers cited focus primarily on land use/land cover classification accuracy using XGBoost, forest type accuracy, and the application of deep learning models for various ecological studies. However, they do not provide details about the data augmentation techniques employed during their research. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based on the given context.
