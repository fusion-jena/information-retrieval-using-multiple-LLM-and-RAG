The training process uses an early stopping method to determine when training is complete. This method keeps the model weights before the models overfit. The patience parameter for this early stopping method is set at 10 epochs for all training phases. Additionally, the models are trained for a specific number of epochs, which are 40 and 25 epochs for SEIO PBW vocalization training and blue whale Dcall training, respectively.
