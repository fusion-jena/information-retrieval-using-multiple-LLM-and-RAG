The context provided mentions several sources of data used in the analysis of herring populations. These include reports from the ICES Herring Assessment Working Group (HAWG) from 2014 and 2015, which likely contain survey data or other forms of collected information on herring populations. Additionally, there is mention of historical reconstructed sea surface temperature (SST) data derived from satellite imagery and in-situ observations, provided by Reynolds, National Climatic Data Center and MET Office Hadley Centre EN4 quality controlled ocean data version: EN.4.2.1. This suggests that remote sensing technology and publicly available datasets are also used as sources of raw data. However, specific details about the exact methods used for collecting raw data are not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
