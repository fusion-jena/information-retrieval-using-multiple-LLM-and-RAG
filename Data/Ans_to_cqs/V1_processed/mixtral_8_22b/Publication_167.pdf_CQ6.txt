Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps may be involved depending on the nature of the dataset. In the given context, the authors mention performing batch normalization on their input data due to significant differences in the distribution between different batches of training data and between the training and test sets.

Batch normalization is a technique used to improve the performance and stability of neural networks. It involves calculating the mean and variance of each feature across a mini-batch of inputs, then normalizing each input based on these statistics. This process helps reduce internal covariate shift, making the network more stable and easier to train.

To perform batch normalization, first, calculate the mean (μβ) and variance (σ²β) of each feature within the current mini-batch. Then, normalize each input (xi) by subtracting its corresponding mean (μβ) and dividing by the square root of the variance plus a small constant (ε), which prevents division by zero. Finally, apply a learnable scale factor (γ) and bias term (β) to the normalized values to maintain representational power.

In summary, the preprocessing step mentioned in the given context involves applying batch normalization to the input data before training the deep learning model. This technique aims to stabilize the learning process and improve overall performance.
