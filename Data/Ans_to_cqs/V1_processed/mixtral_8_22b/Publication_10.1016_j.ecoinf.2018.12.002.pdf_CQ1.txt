The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific method used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that one possible source of raw data could be Acceleration Data Collection (ACC), which was mentioned in relation to studying animal behavior. Additionally, the context mentions neural networks, CARTs, linear discriminant analysis, random forests, and support vector machines as machine learning algorithms used for supervised learning of animal behavior based on ACC data. It also briefly describes random forests and support vector machines. Therefore, while the exact methods for collecting raw data are not specified, it can be assumed that ACC may be one such method.
