The data is split into a train set and a test set. The train set consists of 4781 sites and is used for fitting all models. The test set comprises 400 sites and is aimed at testing the models' generalization capabilities. Both sets are randomly sampled subsets of sites. After predictions are made for every species of E50 using these datasets, several model performance metrics are calculated for each species and for both the train and test sets. These metrics are then averaged over the 50 species.
