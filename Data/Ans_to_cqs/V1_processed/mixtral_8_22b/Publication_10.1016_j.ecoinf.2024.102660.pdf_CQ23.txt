To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the study used diverse datasets, including the Water Sun Glint Dataset (WSGD), which contains various types of water sun glint images captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Using such a diverse dataset helps prevent overfitting and improves the model's ability to perform well on unseen data. Secondly, the study implemented a residual structure inspired by the ResNet network (He et al., 2016) to improve the flow of information through the layers and reduce the risk of vanishing gradients. Lastly, to further address overfitting, the number of 3x3 convolutional kernels in the convolutional block was reduced from 64 to 32. By taking these measures, the researchers aimed to create a more robust and accurate deep learning model capable of detecting water sun glint in UAV water images.
