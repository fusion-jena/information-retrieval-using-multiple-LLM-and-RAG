The proposed water quality monitoring system uses a deep learning model called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), which is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The LSTM model is known for its ability to learn and predict time-series data, making it suitable for applications like streamflow forecasting or water pollution detection in ecological informatics. In this case, the LSTM model is used to improve the performance of existing monitoring systems using the swimming behavior of C. elegans as an early warning indicator for water quality pollution detection.
