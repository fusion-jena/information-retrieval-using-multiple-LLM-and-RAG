Based on the given information, it appears that the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly mentioned. However, it does mention that some studies have utilized deep learning strategies such as neural networks. Therefore, without further context, we cannot determine whether the deep learning model used is specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Transformer, or another type of neural network.
