A convolutional neural network (CNN) is used in the pipeline for large vocabulary bird species classification from flight calls. This deep learning model was trained using mini-batch stochastic gradient descent with a constant learning rate of 0.01 and dropout applied to the input of the last two layers with a probability of 0.5. L2-regularization was also applied to the weights of the last two layers with a penalty factor of 0.001. The model was trained for 100 epochs and checkpointed after each epoch. Data stream multiplexing was implemented using Pescador. The performance of the CNN model was evaluated in terms of classification accuracy through 5-fold cross-validation, achieving a mean accuracy of 0.94.
