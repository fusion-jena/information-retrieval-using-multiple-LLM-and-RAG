The given context does not provide information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, confusion matrix etc. However, based on general knowledge, common postprocessing steps after model training include evaluating the performance of the trained model using various evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score etc. A confusion matrix can also be used to visualize the performance of the model. Additionally, saliency maps can be generated to understand how the model arrived at its predictions. These steps help in fine tuning the model and improving its performance.
