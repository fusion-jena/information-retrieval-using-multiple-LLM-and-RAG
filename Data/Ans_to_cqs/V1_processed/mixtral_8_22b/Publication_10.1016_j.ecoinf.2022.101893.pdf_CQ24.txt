Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, we can infer some general practices used in deep learning models to manage randomness.

One common strategy is setting a fixed random seed value before training the model. This ensures reproducibility by making sure that the initial weights and biases of the neural networks remain consistent across multiple runs. It helps in debugging and comparing different architectures or hyperparameters.

Another approach is using techniques like cross-validation or bootstrap sampling to estimate the variability due to random initialization. Cross-validation involves splitting the dataset into several subsets and training/testing the model on these subsets iteratively. Bootstrap sampling creates new datasets by randomly selecting instances from the original dataset with replacement. Both methods help in understanding how sensitive the model is to changes in the input data distribution.

Additionally, employing ensemble methods can mitigate the impact of randomness. Ensemble methods combine predictions from multiple models trained independently, reducing variance and improving overall performance. By averaging out the outputs of individual models, they become less susceptible to fluctuations caused by random initialization.

Lastly, it's essential to note that while managing randomness is crucial for ensuring consistency and reliability, embracing certain aspects of randomness can sometimes lead to improved generalization. For instance, Dropout – a regularization technique mentioned in the context – introduces randomness during training by temporarily removing neurons along with their connections. This prevents overfitting and encourages the network to learn robust representations.
