The text does not provide explicit information about the specific optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions using the TensorFlow library, which supports various optimization algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp), etc. Therefore, without further clarification, one cannot definitively state which optimization technique is employed in this case.
