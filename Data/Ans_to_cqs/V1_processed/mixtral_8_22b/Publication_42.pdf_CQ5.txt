The paper does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in their deep learning pipeline. However, they did use a dataset containing images of moths for training and validating their CNN models. They also mentioned collecting a sufficiently large dataset with enough data points for efficient classification of rare species as one of the challenges faced. Additionally, they referred to EfficientNetB0, which is typically pre-trained on ImageNet, and ResNetV50, which can be pre-trained on various datasets like ImageNet or Places365. But the paper does not provide explicit information about the exact datasets used for pre-training these models.
