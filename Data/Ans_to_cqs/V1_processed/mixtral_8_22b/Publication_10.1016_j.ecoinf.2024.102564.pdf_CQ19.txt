The given context does not provide information about which specific frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch are used for building the deep learning model. It only mentions two machine learning methods - Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Random Forests (RF), but it doesn't specify any particular framework used for implementing these methods. Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot determine which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model.
