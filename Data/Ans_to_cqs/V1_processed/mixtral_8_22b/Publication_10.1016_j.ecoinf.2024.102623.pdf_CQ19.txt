The text does not provide information about which specific deep learning framework was used to build the model. It only mentions that the model uses an MLP architecture with four layers, each containing 512 neurons, and employs techniques such as batch normalization, ReLU activation function, sigmoid function, AdamW optimizer, and dropout. However, it does not specify whether these were implemented using TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other deep learning framework.
