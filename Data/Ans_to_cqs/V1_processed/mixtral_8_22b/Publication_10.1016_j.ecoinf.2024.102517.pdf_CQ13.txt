The paper uses the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 10^-4 for training the deep feature loss bird noise reduction network model. The model is trained for 50 epochs on an RTX 2080 Ti GPU. During each epoch, the entire training set is presented in a random order, with one noisy bird sound signal per iteration.
