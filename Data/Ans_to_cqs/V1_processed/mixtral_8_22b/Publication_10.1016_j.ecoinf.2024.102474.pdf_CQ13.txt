The text does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the hyperparameters were tuned using an Optuna-based hyperparameter optimization procedure. This suggests that various hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, number of layers, etc., could have been considered during the optimization process. Unfortunately, without further information or access to the original research paper, it is impossible to determine the exact set of hyperparameters used in the final model.
