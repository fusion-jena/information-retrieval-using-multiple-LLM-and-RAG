The given context does not provide specific details on the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common optimization techniques used in deep learning models include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp), and others. These methods help minimize the loss function during training, enabling the model to learn effectively from the input data. Without further context or information, it is impossible to determine which specific optimization technique was employed in this case.
