The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training for any of the mentioned machine learning algorithms (kNN, SVM, or ANN). However, it can be inferred that some form of evaluation and validation techniques would have been employed to assess the performance of the models. These could include metrics calculations such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., and confusion matrices to visualize the performance of the models. Additionally, saliency maps might also have been generated to understand the importance of different features in making predictions. Nevertheless, without further details, it cannot be confirmed what exact postprocessing steps were taken after the model training.
