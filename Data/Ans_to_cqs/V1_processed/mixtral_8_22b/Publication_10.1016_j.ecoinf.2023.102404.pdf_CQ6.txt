Before training a deep learning model, various preprocessing steps may be applied depending on the specific requirements of the problem and the nature of the input data. Some common preprocessing steps include:

1. Data Cleaning: Removing or correcting erroneous, missing, or inconsistent data points from the dataset. This step ensures that the model learns from high-quality data, which improves its overall performance.

2. Normalization: Scaling numerical features to have zero mean and unit variance or transforming them into a specific range (e.g., [0, 1] or [-1, 1]). Normalizing the data helps prevent certain features from dominating others due to their scale differences, leading to better convergence during optimization.

3. Feature Engineering: Creating new features from existing ones to improve the model's understanding of the underlying relationships between variables. Examples include polynomial features, interaction terms, or encoding categorical variables as binary indicators.

4. Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing the number of input features to simplify the model and avoid overfitting. Techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), or autoencoders can be employed for dimensionality reduction.

5. Data Augmentation: Generating additional synthetic samples by applying transformations like rotations, translations, flips, or noise addition to the original data. Data augmentation increases the size of the training set and enhances the model's robustness against variations in the input space.

6. Stratification: Ensuring that the training and validation sets maintain similar class distributions when dealing with classification tasks. Stratification helps prevent biased evaluations caused by imbalanced datasets.

In summary, preprocessing steps play a vital role in preparing the input data for deep learning models. These steps help improve the quality of the data, reduce computational costs, and increase the model's accuracy and generalizability.
