According to the information provided, the hyperparameters of the model were set based on successful implementations of YOLO in remote sensing cases. Specifically, the author of the YOLO-based "Yolt" model suggested implementing the same hyperparameters as the YOLO model. The default parameters of YOLOv3 were used, which include a learning rate of 0.001, a momentum of 0.9, and a weight decay of 0.0005. It appears that no specific optimization method such as grid search or random search was mentioned in the text.
