To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, diverse datasets were utilized, including BirdCLEF2018 and Lishui-Zhejiang Birdsdata. Within these datasets, birds of different class sizes were chosen, creating subsets like BC-S, BC-L, LS, and LS*. This diversity helped prevent overfitting and ensured the model could handle various types of data. Secondly, stratified sampling was applied during the selection process. This technique ensures that the distribution of classes within the training, validation, and test sets remains consistent, which helps maintain the balance between classes and prevents any one class from dominating the others. Lastly, the datasets were split into three distinct groups: 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing. This division allowed for proper assessment of the model's performance and prevented any overlap between the training and testing data, ensuring unbiased evaluations.
