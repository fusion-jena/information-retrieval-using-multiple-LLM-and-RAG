The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does suggest that the authors focus on collecting social media posts and web articles. This implies that they might have used web scraping techniques or APIs provided by these platforms to gather the necessary data. Additionally, the context mentions that the models and pipeline developed in this study can be applied to other forms of textual data, such as listings from e-commerce platforms. This further suggests that the authors could have also employed similar data collection methods for gathering information from those sources. Unfortunately, without more explicit details about the data collection process, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer regarding the exact methods used for obtaining raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
