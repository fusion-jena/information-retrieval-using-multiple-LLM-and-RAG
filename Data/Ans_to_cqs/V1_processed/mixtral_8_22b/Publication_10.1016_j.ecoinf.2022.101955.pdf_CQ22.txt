The performance of the deep learning models is evaluated using several metrics such as overall accuracy, overall producer's accuracy, Kappa statistics, and confidence intervals. Overall accuracy represents the proportion of correctly classified pixels out of all reference data points. Overall producer's accuracy measures how well each land cover type was predicted by the model. Kappa statistics provide a measure of agreement between two raters who each classify items into mutually exclusive categories. Confidence intervals give a range within which the true value lies with a certain level of confidence. In this study, the overall accuracy for the kNN classification was found to be 91.1% for 2020 and 89.7% for 2000, while the overall accuracy for the RF classification was found to be 90.3% for 2020 and 99.3% for 2000.
