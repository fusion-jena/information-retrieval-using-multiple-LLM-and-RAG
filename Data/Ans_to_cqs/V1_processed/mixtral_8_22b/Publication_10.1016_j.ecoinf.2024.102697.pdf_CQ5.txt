The given context does not provide information on the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the paper by Zhang et al. (2023). Therefore, it is not possible to determine which datasets were used in their study. However, some commonly used datasets in deep learning include MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet. These datasets consist of images and corresponding labels, which can be used to train and test various deep learning models.
