The information provided does not specify what data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of biodiversity datasets and covariate data, which could suggest the use of structured data like CSV files. It also discusses the integration of multiple presence-only and presence-absence datasets, but without specifying their format. Therefore, based on this context alone, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.
