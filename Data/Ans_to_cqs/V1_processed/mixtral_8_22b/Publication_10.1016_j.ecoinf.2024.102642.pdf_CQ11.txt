Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide a direct link to the data repository of the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context. It would require more specific details or references to find the exact location of the dataset. However, it is stated that the authors acknowledge the Ple de Calcul et de Donn√©es Marines (PCDM) for providing DATARMOR, which includes storage, data access, computational resources, visualization, web-services, consultation, and support services. This suggests that the data might be accessible through DATARMOR, but further research or contact with the authors would be necessary to confirm this.
