The text does not provide explicit information about specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning before training the deep learning models. However, it mentions that the audio data needs to be converted into a format suitable for input into these models. Specifically, the audio signals are transformed into single-channel images, either as spectrograms or MFCC representations. These visualizations allow the models to process the audio data more effectively. Additionally, the text indicates that the data must be downsampled to 16 kHz due to limitations in the pretrained AST model, which was originally designed for human-perceivable sounds.
