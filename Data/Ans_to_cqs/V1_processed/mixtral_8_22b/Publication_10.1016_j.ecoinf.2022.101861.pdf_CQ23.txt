The text does not provide explicit information on the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it mentions the use of the BirdNET app, which is powered by machine learning and has been shown to reduce barriers to global bird research by enabling citizen science participation (Wood, C.M., et al., 2022). This suggests that the data used to train the model may come from diverse sources, contributing to its generalizability. Additionally, the mention of over one billion observations recorded in eBird (Dansereau et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2022) implies a large and potentially diverse dataset. Nevertheless, without further details, we cannot confirm if techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting were employed during the development of the deep learning model.
