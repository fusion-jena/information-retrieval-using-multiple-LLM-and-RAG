Based on the provided context, it appears that the focus is primarily on the use of machine learning algorithms and remote sensing data for creating fire risk maps rather than discussing specific optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, there isn't enough information to provide a direct answer regarding which optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, the context does mention that various modeling techniques like artificial neural networks, deep learning, and logistic regression can help refine these maps. This suggests that deep learning methods may indeed play a role in developing fire risk maps, but without more explicit details about their implementation, we cannot determine which optimization techniques are being utilized.
