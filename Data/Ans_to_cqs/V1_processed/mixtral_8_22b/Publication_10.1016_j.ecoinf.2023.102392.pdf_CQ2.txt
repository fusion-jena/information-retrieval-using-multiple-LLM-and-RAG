The text does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline for forest type classification. However, based on the information given, we can infer that the primary data format used is likely image data. Specifically, the study employs the XGBoost image classification approach, which suggests that the input data consists of images. Additionally, the text mentions combining UAV data with SPOT satellite images, indicating that both sources provide imagery data. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning pipeline primarily uses image data for forest type classification.
