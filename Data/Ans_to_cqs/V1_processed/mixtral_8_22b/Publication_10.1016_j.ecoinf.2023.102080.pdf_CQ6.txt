The text does not provide information about preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it discusses a two-step "embedded" covariate selection procedure aimed at optimizing predictive ability and parsimony of species distribution models. This procedure involves a collinearity-filtering algorithm (Step A) and three model-specific embedded regularization techniques (Step B). These techniques include generalized linear model with elastic net regularization, generalized additive model with null-space penalization, and guided regularized random forest.

Before applying these techniques, the data is processed based on spatial resolution (i.e., windows of 100-m, 500-m, or 1-km radii), category level (e.g., within thematic covariate categories), and using all remainders. Additionally, parameters like algorithms, target number of covariates, maximum possible number of covariates, number of cores for parallel operations, correlation coefficient threshold, category-level covariate names, and variable-level names are defined.

However, specific preprocessing steps related to normalization, scaling, or cleaning typically applied before training a deep learning model are not mentioned in the given context.
