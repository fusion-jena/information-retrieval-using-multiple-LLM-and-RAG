Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in the deep learning pipeline. Instead, the text discusses the use of Global Fishing Watch (GFW) data, which includes vessel data aggregated at 0.01 resolutions with fishing activity cells already classified through a machine learning model. Additionally, the context mentions the use of heterogeneous data collection systems and differences in dataset sizes, suggesting that multiple datasets may be involved in the analysis. However, without further clarification, it cannot be definitively stated what specific datasets are utilized in the deep learning pipeline.
