The provided context does not directly address the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing the impact of random seed values. However, some general approaches to manage randomness in deep learning include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, employing techniques like cross-validation and ensemble methods to reduce variance, and utilizing regularization methods to prevent overfitting. It should be noted that these strategies may vary depending on the specific application and goals of the deep learning project.
