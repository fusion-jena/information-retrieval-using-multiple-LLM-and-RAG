The text does not explicitly mention where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it mentions that the authors have made their implemented PBP method available in Python through the 'pypbp' package. This suggests that the code or scripts used for implementing the deep learning pipeline might be accessible via this package. Unfortunately, without further information, I cannot determine if the dataset used for training and testing the models is also publicly available. Therefore, I recommend checking the 'pypbp' package documentation or contacting the authors directly for more details about accessing the data repository.
