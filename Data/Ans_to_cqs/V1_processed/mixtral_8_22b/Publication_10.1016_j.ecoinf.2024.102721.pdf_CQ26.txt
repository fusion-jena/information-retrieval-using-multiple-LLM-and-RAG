To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. One such technique is stratified splitting, which involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same proportion of classes or labels in each set. This ensures that the distribution of classes remains consistent throughout the entire dataset. Another approach is oversampling, where additional instances of minority class samples are created to balance the dataset. Conversely, undersampling involves removing instances from the majority class to reduce imbalance. Additionally, diverse data collection can also help mitigate data bias by ensuring that the dataset includes examples from various sources, reducing overrepresentation of certain groups or categories. These techniques aim to improve the generalizability and fairness of the deep learning model by minimizing biases introduced through imbalanced or non-representative datasets.
