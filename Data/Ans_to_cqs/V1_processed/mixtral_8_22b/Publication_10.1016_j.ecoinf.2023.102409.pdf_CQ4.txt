The text does not provide specific information about the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, and adjusting brightness or contrast. These techniques help increase the amount of training data available and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

The data augmentation technique used in this case is flipping. This means that the original dataset is duplicated but mirrored horizontally. This doubles the amount of training data available without actually collecting more data. Other possible data augmentation techniques could be rotation, scaling, or cropping.
