The deep learning models mentioned in the given context are built using the R framework (version 3.3.2). Specifically, the mxnet library, which is a convenient C++ library for learning deep neural networks, is used. This library is deployed as an R package and allows for easy integration into the R environment. Additionally, the maxnet package is used to fit the MAXENT model for every species of E50. However, no mention is made of popular deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
