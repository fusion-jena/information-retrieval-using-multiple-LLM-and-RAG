Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, confusion matrix, etc. However, it can be inferred from the context that some form of evaluation and comparison of the candidate models is done based on their accuracy, which is defined as the proportion of cases correctly classified. This evaluation is carried out using a separate validation dataset (Av) not used during the initial training phase. After selecting the best performing model, it is further trained on the complete training dataset (Bt) for up to 30 epochs. Additionally, another validation dataset (Bv) is used to determine the optimal number of epochs for training the final model. Therefore, while the exact postprocessing steps aren't mentioned, it can be understood that they involve evaluating the model's performance using appropriate metrics and datasets.
