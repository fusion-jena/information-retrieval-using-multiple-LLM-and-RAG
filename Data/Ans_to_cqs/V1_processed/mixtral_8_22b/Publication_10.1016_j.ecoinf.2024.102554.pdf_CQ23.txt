The paper does not explicitly mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the authors used diverse datasets from different sources like ESA and NASA, which included various parameters such as reflectance, Aerosol Optical Thickness (Kd940), and Chlorophyll-a concentrations. This diversity in the dataset could contribute to improving the model's ability to generalize well across different scenarios. Additionally, the use of multiple sensors (Sentinel, VIIRS, and MODIS) with varying temporal resolutions might also help improve the robustness and generalization capabilities of the model. Nevertheless, without explicit information about techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting, one cannot definitively state what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
