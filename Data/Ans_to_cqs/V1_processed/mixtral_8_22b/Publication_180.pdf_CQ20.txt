The provided context does not explicitly mention which specific hardware resources were used for training the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the authors likely utilized GPU resources due to the common practice of employing graphics processing units for accelerating deep learning tasks. TensorFlow, being a popular deep learning framework, has built-in support for both CPUs and GPUs, with GPU usage often providing faster computations when dealing with large datasets or complex models. Nonetheless, without explicit information regarding the hardware resources used, one cannot definitively state whether only GPUs, TPUs, or other types of hardware were involved in the training process.
