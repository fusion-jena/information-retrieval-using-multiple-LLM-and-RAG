The deep learning pipeline primarily uses video format data. Specifically, the paper discusses using video clips for training, validating, and testing various models such as Mask R-CNN and FGFA. Additionally, the authors mention processing these video clips frame by frame, which implies they also work with individual image frames extracted from the videos. There is no explicit mention of using any other data formats like audio, CSV, etc.
