The study uses a random split method to divide the dataset into training and validation sets. The dataset consists of 235 predictors and 5000 data points, which are randomly split into 3000 for training and 2000 for validation, maintaining a ratio of 60/40. The model achieves perfect training accuracy of 1.0 and a commendable accuracy of 0.924 on the validation dataset. After optimizing the hyperparameters of the Random Forest (RF) model, its performance was carefully evaluated. However, the specific details about how the test set was created or if there even was one are not mentioned in the given information.
