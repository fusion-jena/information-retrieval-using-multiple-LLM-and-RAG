Unfortunately, based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It does not specify if the data is stored in any of the mentioned platforms such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
