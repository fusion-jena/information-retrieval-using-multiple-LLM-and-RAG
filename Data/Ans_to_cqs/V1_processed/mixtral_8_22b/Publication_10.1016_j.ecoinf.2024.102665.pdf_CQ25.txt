Based on the provided context, specifically the paper titled "Combining a deep learning model with an optimization algorithm to detect the dispersal of the early stages of spotted butterfish in northern Vietnam under global warming" by Do, A.N.T., and Tran, H.D., published in Eco. Inform. 78, 102380, we can infer that the purpose of the deep learning model is likely related to object detection or pattern recognition. However, without access to the full text of the article, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the specific type of task the deep learning model performs. Nevertheless, considering the title and the fact that many deep learning models are employed for tasks such as image analysis, natural language processing, and speech recognition, it is reasonable to assume that this particular model might be utilized for similar purposes.
