The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using the Optuna package, which employs complex optimization algorithms to automatically search the hyperparameter space for the greatest combination of hyperparameters that minimizes the mean squared error. Different random training datasets are used to develop the models, enabling the realization of optimized parameters using the Optuna package. The multi-modal nature of some of the distribution of the parameters indicates several peaks that provide a good trade-off between performance and computational cost. The distribution of the parameters slightly varies with each modeling scenario. For example, in the RF\_w/o\_Sensor scenario, the modal number of estimators observed was 20, which increased to 50 in the RF\_w/\_Sensor\_cont scenario.
