The given context does not provide specific information regarding the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it mentions that after collecting samples, they were checked carefully, and no mis-collected samples were found. This implies some form of data cleaning was performed. Additionally, the use of a 60%-40% ratio for splitting the dataset into training and validation sets suggests that the data might have been shuffled and split, which could also be considered part of the preprocessing stage. Nevertheless, without explicit information, it cannot be confirmed if these steps were taken specifically for preparing the data for a deep learning model.
