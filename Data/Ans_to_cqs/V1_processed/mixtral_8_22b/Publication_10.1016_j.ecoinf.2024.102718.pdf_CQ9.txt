Unfortunately, based on the given information, there isn't any explicit mention of where the data repositories of the deep learning pipeline are available. The mentioned datasets - Plant Village and Dhan-Shomadhan - can be found through their respective citations or sources, but it does not specify if they have been uploaded to specific data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the availability of these datasets in those particular data repositories.
