The given context does not provide specific information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it can be inferred that the FIT pairwise comparison model was used to generate a classification dendrogram for 44 trails from captive Amur tigers. The process was iterated multiple times by altering elements within the model to generate the fewest misclassifications. The final classification model correctly predicted 44 tigers with 100% accuracy. It is possible that postprocessing steps such as metrics calculation or confusion matrix generation may have been performed to evaluate the performance of the model. However, without explicit mention of these steps in the given context, it cannot be confirmed.
