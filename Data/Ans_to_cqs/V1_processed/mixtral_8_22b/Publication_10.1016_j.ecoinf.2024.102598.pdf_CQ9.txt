The paper does not provide information on where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that the dataset used was obtained from the Forest Survey of India (FSI). Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is located.

Unhelpful  The data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available on GitHub.

Explanation: This answer is unhelpful because it provides incorrect information. The paper does not mention anything about using GitHub as a data repository for the deep learning pipeline.
