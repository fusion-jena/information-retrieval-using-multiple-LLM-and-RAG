The main goal of the deep learning model discussed here is image classification. Specifically, it aims to classify bee images into various categories related to beehive monitoring tasks. The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture with multiple hidden layers, each containing convolution and pooling operations. The Dropout layer is included to prevent overfitting, while the Global Average Pooling layer helps summarize features and provide inputs for the fully connected layer. Ultimately, the final three fully connected layers generate the predicted class for the original image.

Additionally, there is another model mentioned that focuses on object detection. It trains an object detection network to identify two classes: pollen-bearing and non-pollen-bearing bees. To tackle the problem of data imbalance between these two classes, the focal loss function is proposed. This function assigns higher weights to more difficult or potentially misclassified samples, which often involve complex backgrounds or partially represented objects.
