Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model proposed in the study. However, some common techniques used to improve the generalizability of deep learning models include using diverse datasets, cross-validation, stratified splitting, and regularization techniques like dropout or L1/L2 regularization. It would be best to refer to the original paper or contact the authors directly for more detailed information regarding the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model.
