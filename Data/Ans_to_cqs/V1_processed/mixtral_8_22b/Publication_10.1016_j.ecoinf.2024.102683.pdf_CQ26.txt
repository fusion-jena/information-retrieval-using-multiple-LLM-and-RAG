The text does not provide explicit information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it mentions the use of data augmentation (DA) techniques to improve the generalization ability of the network and overcome overfitting problems.

Data augmentation involves artificially increasing and diversifying the training dataset by creating modified copies of the original data. Instead of simple random transformations, a designed set of DAs can significantly improve the network's generalization ability. Automatic DA methods work autonomously and help avoid potential biases introduced by manual intervention.

Additionally, the text discusses the implementation of an attention mechanism to enhance the performance of the proposed model. Attention mechanisms allow deep learning networks to focus precisely on relevant input elements, improving their efficiency. They have been successfully applied in various domains, such as text classification, image interpretation, and sentiment analysis.

While the text does not directly mention techniques specifically aimed at addressing data bias, the use of data augmentation and attention mechanisms could potentially contribute to mitigating bias indirectly. By expanding and diversifying the training dataset, data augmentation may reduce the risk of overrepresentation or underrepresentation of certain classes or features. Similarly, attention mechanisms might help the model prioritize relevant features and minimize the impact of irrelevant or misleading information.
