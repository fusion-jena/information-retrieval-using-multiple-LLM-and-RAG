In the field of deep learning, preventing overfitting is crucial to ensure that models generalize well to unseen data. Regularization techniques play a significant role in achieving this goal. Two commonly used regularization methods are Dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent complex co-adaptations on training data. This method effectively creates an ensemble of multiple neural networks within a single network, improving its ability to generalize. During each iteration of the training process, some number of layer outputs are randomly ignored or "dropped out." This has the effect of making the layer look-like and be treated-like a layer with a different number of nodes and connectivity to the prior layer. In effect, each update to a layer during training is performed with a different "view" of the configured layer. Dropout has the effect of making the training process noisy, forcing nodes within a layer to probabilistically take on more or less responsibility for the inputs. It reduces overfitting by providing a way of automatically and adaptively regularizing neural networks.

On the other hand, L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, involves adding a penalty term to the loss function, encouraging smaller weights. This penalty term is proportional to the square of the magnitude of all the weights in the network. By discouraging large weights, L2 regularization prevents any single feature from dominating the predictions and encourages the model to spread out the weights among many features. This leads to a more robust model that can better generalize to new data.

These two regularization methods, along with others such as L1 regularization and early stopping, help mitigate the risk of overfitting in deep learning pipelines. They contribute to building models that perform well not only on the training data but also on previously unseen data.
