The provided context does not explicitly mention any preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. Preprocessing steps typically include data cleaning, normalization, scaling, augmentation, etc. Data cleaning involves removing noise and inconsistent data points. Normalization scales numeric columns to a range between 0 and 1, which can help improve the convergence rate during optimization. Scaling adjusts values measured on different scales to a common scale, making it easier to compare them. Augmentation generates new samples by applying random transformations to existing ones, helping prevent overfitting. These steps may vary depending on the dataset and problem statement.
