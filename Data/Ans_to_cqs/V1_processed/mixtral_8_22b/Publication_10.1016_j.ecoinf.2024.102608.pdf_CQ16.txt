The table does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete for each machine learning model. However, common criteria include reaching a minimum validation loss or accuracy threshold, achieving a stable validation loss over several epochs, or using early stopping based on validation metrics.

The given text provides details about the hyperparameters obtained after tuning each machine learning model for predicting Chlorophyll-a (CHL-a), Secchi depth (SD), and Total Suspended Solids (TSS) using Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat-8 OLI datasets. The table lists various hyperparameters such as Number of Decision Trees, Maximum Depth of the Decision Tree, Minimum Samples Leaf, Bootstrap, Number of Neighbors, Weights, Algorithm p, Learning Rate, Loss, Hidden Layer Sizes, Activation, Solver, Alpha, etc.

However, the table does not explicitly mention any criteria used to determine when training is complete for each machine learning model. Commonly used criteria to decide when training should be stopped include reaching a minimum validation loss or accuracy threshold, observing a stable validation loss over multiple epochs, or employing early stopping based on validation metrics. These criteria help prevent overfitting and ensure optimal model performance.
