Based on the given context, it can be inferred that the data format used in this deep learning pipeline is image data. The text mentions that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are employed, which are specifically designed for processing high-dimensional imagery. Furthermore, the context discusses the use of CNNs in environmental studies for estimating cyanobacteria levels and identifying various algal species based on image data. Therefore, it can be concluded that the data format used in this deep learning pipeline is primarily image data. However, without explicit mention of other data formats, we cannot confirm if additional formats such as audio, video, or CSV files were also utilized in the pipeline.
