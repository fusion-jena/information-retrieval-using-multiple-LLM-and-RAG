The research article titled "Marine Data Prediction: An Evaluation of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Statistical Predictive Models" does not explicitly mention any specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it focuses on utilizing a real dataset obtained from the Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency for predicting Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Significant Wave Height (SWH). The authors propose a deep learning model combining gated recurrent units (GRU) with a regular neural network to efficiently anticipate marine features. This appears to be the first application of a GRU model architecture for forecasting SST and SWH. Additionally, the researchers employ four different machine learning models – Linear Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) – to compare their performances against the deep learning approach.
