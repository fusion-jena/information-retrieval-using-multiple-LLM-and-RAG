Two datasets have been mentioned in the given context. One is the "Pest24" dataset, consisting of 25,378 annotated images collected by an automatic imaging trap. This dataset includes images from 24 pest species. Another dataset is not explicitly named but referred to as data acquired by multiple wireless imaging devices installed in greenhouses under varying lighting environments. These datasets are used for tasks such as object detection, insect vs non-insect separation, and multi-class insect classification. However, no widely recognized benchmark datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet are directly mentioned in the provided context.
