The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the authors have collected weather parameters such as minimum, maximum, and average temperature, standard meteorological week (SMW)-wise growing degree days (GDD), minimum relative humidity (RHmini.), maximum relative humidity (RHmax.), average relative humidity (RHave.), cumulative rainfall (mm), and whitefly per three leaves. These data points were likely obtained using various types of sensors or instruments installed at weather stations located at each of the four locations mentioned in Fig. 2. Additionally, the authors may have also gathered data through field observations or surveys to determine the percentage incidence of Cotton Leaf Curl Disease (CLCuD) in upland cotton crops. Nevertheless, without further clarification from the original source, this is only a speculation based on the available context.
