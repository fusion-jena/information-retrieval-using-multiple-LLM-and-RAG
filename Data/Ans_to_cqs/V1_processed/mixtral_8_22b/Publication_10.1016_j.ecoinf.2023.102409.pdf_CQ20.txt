The given context does not provide information about the specific hardware resources used for training the DeepLabV3+ model. However, typically, deep learning models like this one require significant computational power, often provided by Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). These units can handle parallel processing tasks efficiently, which is essential for training large neural networks. Therefore, while we cannot definitively state what hardware resources were used in this case due to lack of explicit information, it is highly likely that either GPUs or TPUs were employed.
