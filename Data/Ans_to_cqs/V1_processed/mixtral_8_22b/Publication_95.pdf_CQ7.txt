When splitting the data for deep learning model training into a training set, a validation set, and a test set, several criteria are considered. Firstly, the training set is used for optimizing the parameters of the network, so it should contain enough examples to allow the model to learn effectively. Secondly, the validation set is used for monitoring the performance of the network during training and for comparing the performance of different networks with varying hyperparameters or network structures. Therefore, it should also include a representative sample of the data. Lastly, the test set serves as a final evaluation of the network, ensuring that the model generalizes well to unseen data. It should not overlap with either the training or validation sets and should ideally represent the distribution of the real-world data. Additionally, all three sets should maintain similar class distributions to prevent any bias towards certain classes. In this case, the full dataset was split such that samples in each set were independent and had similar class distributions.
