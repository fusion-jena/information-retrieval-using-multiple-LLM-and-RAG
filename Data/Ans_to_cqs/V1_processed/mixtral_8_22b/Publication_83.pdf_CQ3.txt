Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does discuss various aspects of the deep learning process including the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with different types of inputs like Mel-spectrogram, harmonic-component based spectrogram, and percussive-component based spectrogram. It also mentions the use of a VGG style network for feature learning and categorical cross entropy as the loss function. Additionally, it refers to a SubSpectralNet architecture being used with the Mel-spectrogram as input. Therefore, while the context does not provide information about data annotation techniques, it does offer insights into other components of the deep learning pipeline.
