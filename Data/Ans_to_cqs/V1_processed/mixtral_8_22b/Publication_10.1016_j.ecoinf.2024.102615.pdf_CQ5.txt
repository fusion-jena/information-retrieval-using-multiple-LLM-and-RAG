The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of spectral reflectance data with 4200 dimensions as input for the neural network. This suggests that the dataset might contain hyperspectral or multispectral images related to soil analysis or environmental studies. Unfortunately, without more detailed information, it is impossible to determine if well-known datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet were utilized in this particular case.
