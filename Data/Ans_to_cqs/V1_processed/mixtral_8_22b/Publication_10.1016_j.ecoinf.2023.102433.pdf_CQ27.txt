Based on the provided context, it appears that the information regarding the deployment of the trained deep learning model is not explicitly mentioned. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed step-by-step process about how the trained deep learning model was deployed. However, some general steps involved in deploying a machine learning or deep learning model include:

1. Serializing the model: This involves converting the trained model into a format that can be easily stored and transferred between different environments. Common formats used for model serialization include pickle files (for Python models), ONNX, TensorFlow SavedModel, etc.

2. Selecting a platform: Once the model is serialized, it needs to be hosted on a suitable platform where it can receive input data and generate predictions. Some popular platforms for hosting machine learning models include AWS SageMaker, Google Cloud AI Platform, Azure Machine Learning Studio, etc.

3. Deploying the model: After selecting a platform, the next step is to upload the serialized model onto the chosen platform and configure any necessary settings such as scaling policies, security permissions, etc.

Without further details about the specific tools, technologies, and procedures used in this case, I am unable to provide a more precise response.
