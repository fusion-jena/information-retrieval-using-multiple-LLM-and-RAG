Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model. It primarily focuses on describing the architecture of the model, which consists of an encoder and decoder implemented as wide residual networks using deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model employs residual blocks with skip connections to increase the variance between the input and output at each layer. However, details regarding the optimization techniques, learning rates, batch sizes, or other relevant hyperparameters are not mentioned in the provided text.
