The text does not explicitly state the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions that the models were trained for 150 epochs using Nvidia Tesla K80 or P100 GPUs. Epochs refer to one forward pass and one backward pass of all the training examples. Therefore, we can infer that the completion of training was determined based on the number of epochs rather than other metrics like validation loss plateau.
