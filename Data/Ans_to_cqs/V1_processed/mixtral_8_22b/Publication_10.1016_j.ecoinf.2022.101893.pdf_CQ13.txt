Unfortunately, based on the given information, it does not explicitly state the specific hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model. However, we can infer some details about the architecture of the model. It appears that the network was designed with four convolutional kernel pooling layers to extract deep features, followed by a fully connected layer for connections. Additionally, a Dense_1 layer was added after flattening to reduce the dimensionality of the deep features, setting the parameter to 500. This could be considered a hyperparameter related to the structure of the model. Nevertheless, without explicit mention of the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, epochs, etc., I cannot provide more detailed information regarding these aspects of the deep learning model.
