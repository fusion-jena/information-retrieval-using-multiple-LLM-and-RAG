The given context does not provide explicit information about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it can be inferred that some form of preprocessing might have been done due to the mention of 'lag features' and 'K previous observations'. These terms suggest that time series data was used, and possibly some sort of feature engineering or transformation was applied to prepare the data for training the GRU-DNN model. Nevertheless, without specific details regarding these aspects, it cannot be confirmed what exact preprocessing steps were taken.
