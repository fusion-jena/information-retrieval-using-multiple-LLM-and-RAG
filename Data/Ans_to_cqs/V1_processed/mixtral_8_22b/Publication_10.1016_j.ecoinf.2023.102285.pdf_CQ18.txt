To ensure the reliability and robustness of the proposed methodology, a four-phase evaluation process was established. Phase I involved initial testing using historical datasets, while Phase II focused on preventing overfitting through cross-validation. In Phase III, the methodology was evaluated using recent surveys, consisting of 57 images with ISMMMOs and 5000 images without them. This dataset was separate from those used in establishing the methodology to assess its effectiveness on other independent datasets. Satisfactory results (Se, Sp, PPV, NPV, and ACC > 0.95) were achieved in this phase. Lastly, Phase IV entailed validation by field experts using the most recent surveys. However, the specific strategy to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
