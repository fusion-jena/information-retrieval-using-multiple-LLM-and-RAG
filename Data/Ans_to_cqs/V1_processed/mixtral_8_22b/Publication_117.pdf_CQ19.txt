The text mentions that libraries such as TensorFlow are used to implement these algorithms. Therefore, it can be inferred that one of the frameworks used to build the deep learning model is TensorFlow. However, the text does not provide information about other possible frameworks used, so it cannot be determined if additional frameworks like PyTorch were also utilized.
