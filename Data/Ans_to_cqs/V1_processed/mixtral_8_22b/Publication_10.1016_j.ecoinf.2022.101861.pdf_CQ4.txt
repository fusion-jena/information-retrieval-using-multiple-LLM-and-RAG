The given context does not provide information on the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for identifying Nighthawk vocalizations. However, it mentions the use of Kaleidoscope Pro 5.4.7, an automated signal recognition software capable of analyzing large acoustic datasets. This tool extracts sounds of interest based on five parameters: minimum and maximum signal length, minimum and maximum frequency range, and maximum intersyllable gap. These parameters help characterize the Nighthawk's song from spectrograms using Raven Pro 1.5. While the text does not explicitly mention any data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotation, or scaling, these methods could potentially be employed during preprocessing or training stages to improve model performance. Nevertheless, without further details about the deep learning pipeline, it remains uncertain whether such techniques have been implemented.
