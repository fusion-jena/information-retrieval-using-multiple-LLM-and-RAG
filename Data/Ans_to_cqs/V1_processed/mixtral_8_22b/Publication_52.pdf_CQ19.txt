The text does not provide explicit information about the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the implementation of the proposed framework was based on the DELE philosophy. DELE stands for Dynamic Ensemble Learning Environment, which is a software platform designed for developing and deploying ensemble learning models. While DELE itself is not a deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch, it could potentially utilize these frameworks within its environment. Therefore, without further context, we cannot definitively state which frameworks were used to build the deep learning model.
