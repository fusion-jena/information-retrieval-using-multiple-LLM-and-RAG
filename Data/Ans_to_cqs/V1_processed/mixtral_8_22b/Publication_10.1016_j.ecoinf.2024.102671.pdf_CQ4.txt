The given context does not contain any specific details about the application of data augmentation techniques in a deep learning pipeline. However, some common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, shearing, and translating images. These techniques help increase the size of training datasets and prevent overfitting by introducing variations into the dataset. For example, image flipping involves creating mirror images of existing images, while rotation involves rotating images by a certain degree. Image scaling adjusts the size of images, either increasing or decreasing them, while cropping removes parts of an image to focus on a particular region. Zooming magnifies or shrinks images, while shearing distorts images along one axis. Translation moves images horizontally or vertically without changing their orientation. The choice of technique depends on the nature of the problem being solved and the characteristics of the dataset.
