I am sorry, but I cannot provide information on the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline based on the given context. However, some common data annotation techniques used in deep learning include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangles around objects of interest in images or videos. Semantic segmentation is the process of labeling each pixel in an image with its corresponding class or category. Instance segmentation combines both object detection and semantic segmentation to identify individual instances of objects within an image. These techniques help train machine learning algorithms to recognize patterns and features in large datasets.

Based on the provided context, it appears that the authors used a random forest model for analysis, but there is no mention of any specific data annotation techniques used in this study. Therefore, I do not have enough information to determine what data annotation techniques were used in this particular case.
