The context does not provide explicit information on the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, it can be inferred from common practices in machine learning that the dataset might have been divided into three subsets: training, validation, and testing datasets. Typically, the training dataset is used to fit the model, while the validation dataset is employed to tune hyperparameters during the training process. Lastly, the testing dataset is applied to evaluate the final performance of the trained model. The proportion of each subset varies depending on the specific application or researcher preference but often ranges between 60-80% for training, 10-20% for validation, and 10-20% for testing.
