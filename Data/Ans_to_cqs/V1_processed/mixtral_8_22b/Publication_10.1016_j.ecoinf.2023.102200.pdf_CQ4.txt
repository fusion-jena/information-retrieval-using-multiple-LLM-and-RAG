The given context does not provide specific information about the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipelines mentioned in the papers. However, common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, translation, and noise injection. These techniques help increase the amount of training data available and improve the model's ability to generalize by introducing variations into the dataset. It is important to note that the choice of data augmentation technique depends on the nature of the problem being solved and the characteristics of the input data. Therefore, it cannot be determined which specific data augmentation techniques were applied in these studies without further information.
