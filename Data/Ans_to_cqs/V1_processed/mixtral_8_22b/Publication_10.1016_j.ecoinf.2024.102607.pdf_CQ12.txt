The given context does not provide information about the use of any specific deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers in the pipeline. Instead, it discusses various machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Random Forests (RFs), Decision Trees (DTs), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) being used for Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) mapping. Among these, the Random Forest (RF) classifier is mentioned as having better performance and robustness against noise. Additionally, the text mentions the application of Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform, Sentinel imagery, and neural networks for crop mapping in Canada but does not specify which type of neural network was used. Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot determine what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline.
