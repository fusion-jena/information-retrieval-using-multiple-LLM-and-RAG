The hyperparameters of the model are optimized through iterative grid search parameter tuning. This method involves selecting a range of values for each hyperparameter and then exhaustively searching through all possible combinations of these values to find the best set of hyperparameters for the given problem. In this study, after performing the grid search, the authors found that using five hidden layers with varying numbers of neurons in each layer produced the best results for their specific application.
