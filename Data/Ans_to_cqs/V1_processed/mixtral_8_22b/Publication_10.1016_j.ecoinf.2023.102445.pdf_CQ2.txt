The given context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does indicate that the neural network being discussed involves a 2D convolution operation (Conv2d) performed on the input X, which suggests that the input data could be in the form of images or videos. Additionally, the use of a 2D convolution operation further supports the idea that the input data might be visual data such as images or frames extracted from videos. Therefore, we can infer that the deep learning pipeline described in the context likely utilizes image or video data formats.
