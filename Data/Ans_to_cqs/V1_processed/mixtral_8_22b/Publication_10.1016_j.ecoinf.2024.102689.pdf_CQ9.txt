The provided context does not explicitly mention where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it mentions that there is a scarcity of databases for live underwater fish individuals, which poses a significant challenge in the field. Therefore, it can be inferred that the authors did not find any suitable data repository for their research. It would be best to contact the authors or refer to the original paper for further information regarding the availability of the data repository.
