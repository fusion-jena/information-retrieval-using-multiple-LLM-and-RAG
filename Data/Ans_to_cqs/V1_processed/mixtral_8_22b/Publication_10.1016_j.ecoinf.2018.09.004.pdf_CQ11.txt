Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no information regarding the specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the paper. The context only provides details about the seagrass classification using a supervised learning approach, dataset integration and fusion, machine learning, and data mining in the Mediterranean Sea. Additionally, references are made to other sources such as GSHHG (Global Self-consistent Hierarchical High-resolution Geography Database), but none of them provide the required information. Therefore, without further context or access to the full text of the article, it is impossible to determine the exact data repository link for the deep learning pipeline.
