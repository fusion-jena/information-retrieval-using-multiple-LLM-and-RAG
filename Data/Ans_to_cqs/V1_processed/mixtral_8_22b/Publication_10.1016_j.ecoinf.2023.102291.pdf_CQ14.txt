The text does not provide explicit information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if techniques such as grid search or random search were employed. However, the text mentions that various experiments were conducted with different numbers of classes and datasets, suggesting some form of parameter tuning may have occurred. Nonetheless, without specific details regarding the optimization process, it remains unclear exactly how the hyperparameters were adjusted.
