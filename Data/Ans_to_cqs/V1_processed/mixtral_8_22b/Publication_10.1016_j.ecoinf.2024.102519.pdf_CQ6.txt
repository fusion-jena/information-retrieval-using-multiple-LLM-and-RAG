Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved to ensure that the data is suitable for input into the model. These steps can include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing or correcting any errors, inconsistencies, or missing values in the dataset. For example, if there are null values in certain features, they may need to be filled in using techniques like mean imputation or regression imputation.

2. Feature Scaling: Deep learning models often perform better when all input features are on a similar scale. Therefore, it is common practice to standardize or normalize feature values. Standardization scales features to have zero mean and unit variance, while normalization scales them between 0 and 1.

3. Data Augmentation: To increase the size of the dataset and improve the generalization performance of the model, synthetic examples can be generated from existing ones. Common augmentation techniques include rotation, flipping, zooming, cropping, and adding noise.

4. Encoding Categorical Variables: If the dataset contains categorical variables, these must be converted into numerical form before being fed into the model. One popular encoding technique is one-hot encoding, which creates binary vectors for each category level.

5. Splitting Dataset: Before training the model, the dataset should be split into separate subsets for training, validation, and testing purposes. Typically, around 60-80% of the data is allocated for training, 10-20% for validation, and 10-20% for testing.
