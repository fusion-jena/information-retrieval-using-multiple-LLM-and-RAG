Unfortunately, there isn't any specific information given on the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training such as train, test, or validation sets. However, typically, the dataset is divided into three parts: training set, validation set, and test set. The training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Lastly, the test set is used to evaluate the final model's performance. Common methods for splitting include random sampling, stratified sampling, or time series based splits depending on the nature of the problem.
