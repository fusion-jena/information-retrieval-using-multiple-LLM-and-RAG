The text does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions that the Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) is used to tune the lasso penalty. This suggests that BIC might also be employed as a criterion to decide when training should stop. Additionally, the text refers to the use of penalized regression techniques like lasso, ridge, and elastic net regressions, which often involve monitoring validation loss or error during training. When the validation loss plateaus or starts increasing, it indicates that the model has started to overfit the data, signaling that training should cease. Therefore, although not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that validation loss plateau could potentially serve as one of the criteria to determine when training is complete.
