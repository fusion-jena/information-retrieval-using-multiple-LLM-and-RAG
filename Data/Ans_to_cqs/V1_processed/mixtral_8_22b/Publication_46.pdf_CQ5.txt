The paper does not provide information about specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the study was conducted on the foothills of the Himalayas, tracking and mapping the plant species Rhododendron arboreum using different Species Distribution Models (SDMs). It also states that the CNN-based probability distribution model outperformed the presence-only based BIOCLIM model. Therefore, we can infer that the dataset used in this study might be related to satellite-based observations and ecological data relevant to the target species and location.
