The performance of the deep learning models is primarily evaluated using two metrics: accuracy and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC). Accuracy is calculated as the proportion of correctly classified cases, while AUC measures the ability of the model to distinguish between classes. For example, in Table 1, the accuracy of candidate models is presented as percentages, whereas the AUC of selected models is shown as decimal values. It should also be noted that the optimal number of training epochs is determined based on the progression of validation performance, specifically looking for increases in AUC when predicting the validation dataset.
