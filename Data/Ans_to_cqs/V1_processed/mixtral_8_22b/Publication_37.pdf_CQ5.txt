In the given context, it appears that the dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is called CLO-43SD. This dataset was divided into five folds for performing 5-fold cross-validation. The dataset consists of flight calls from 43 different bird species, totaling 5428 recordings. However, there is no mention of other commonly known datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in this particular study. Therefore, the only dataset explicitly mentioned here is the CLO-43SD dataset.
