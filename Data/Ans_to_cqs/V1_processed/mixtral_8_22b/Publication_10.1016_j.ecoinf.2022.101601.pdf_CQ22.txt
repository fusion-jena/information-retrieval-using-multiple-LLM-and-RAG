Based on the given context, it does not provide information about the evaluation metrics used for a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot determine what specific metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model mentioned in the context. However, some common evaluation metrics used for deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC, etc. These metrics help measure how well the model performs on unseen data and provide insights into its strengths and weaknesses.
