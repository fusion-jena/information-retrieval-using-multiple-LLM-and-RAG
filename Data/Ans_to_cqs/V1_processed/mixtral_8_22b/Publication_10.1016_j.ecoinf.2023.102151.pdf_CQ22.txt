The provided sources do not directly address the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models such as accuracy, precision, or recall. Instead, they focus on various aspects related to soil science, including soil property visualization, river analysis, soil moisture estimation, root growth imaging, and data exchange schemas. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer to your query based on the given context. However, generally speaking, common evaluation metrics for deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, and area under the curve (AUC). These metrics help assess different aspects of a model's performance, depending on the problem at hand.
