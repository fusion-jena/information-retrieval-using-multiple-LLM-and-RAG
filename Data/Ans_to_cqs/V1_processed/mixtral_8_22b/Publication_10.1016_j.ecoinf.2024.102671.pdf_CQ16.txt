The context does not provide specific details about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions the importance of effective cross-validation for assessing the generalizability and robustness of ecological zoning models. This suggests that one possible criterion for determining when training is complete might be achieving satisfactory performance on a held-out validation set during cross-validation. Additionally, the context discusses the need for incorporating temporal, spatial, and hierarchical structures inherent in ecological data into the cross-validation approach. Therefore, another potential criterion for determining when training is complete could be successfully capturing these complex patterns in the data. Ultimately, the choice of criteria will depend on the specific goals and requirements of the model being trained.
