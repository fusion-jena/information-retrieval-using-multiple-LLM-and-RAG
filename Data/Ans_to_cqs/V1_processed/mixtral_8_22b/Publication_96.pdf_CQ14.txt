Unfortunately, the given context does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, it mentions that certain parameters such as the learning rate, batch size, and number of interactions were defined based on tests. This could imply that some form of parameter tuning or optimization technique like grid search or random search might have been employed, but without specific details, we cannot confirm this. Therefore, I do not know exactly how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized based on the provided context.
