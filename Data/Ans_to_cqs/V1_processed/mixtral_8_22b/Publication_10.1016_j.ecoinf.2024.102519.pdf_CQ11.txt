Based on the given information, it appears that there are several datasets used in this study, including DEM, land use, NDVI, soil data, population, GDP, meteorological data, vector data, and statistical yearbook. However, none of these datasets seem to be directly related to a deep learning pipeline or model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline based on the available information. It would be helpful if more details about the deep learning pipeline were provided so that I could better assist with finding the appropriate data repository link.
