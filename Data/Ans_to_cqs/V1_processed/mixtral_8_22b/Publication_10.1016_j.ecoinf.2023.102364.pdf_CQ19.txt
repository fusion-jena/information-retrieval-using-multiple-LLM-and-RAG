The article does not mention which specific deep learning framework was used to build the machine learning models. However, it mentions that an ensemble of machine learning models was used, including Random Forest, TreeNet, Classification and Regression Trees (CART), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS). These are all well-established machine learning algorithms but they do not belong to any specific deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, we cannot determine which deep learning framework was used based on the given information.
