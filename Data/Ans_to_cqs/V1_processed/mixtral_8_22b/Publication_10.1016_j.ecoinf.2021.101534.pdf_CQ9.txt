The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) is mentioned as one of the resources used in the SILIC framework, but it does not appear to be explicitly stated as the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. Other online animal sound databases like Macaulay Library, Xeno-Canto, and iNaturalist are listed as sources for training data, but again, they do not seem to serve as the primary data repository for the entire deep learning pipeline. Therefore, based on the given information, it cannot be definitively determined where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. Further research or clarification would be needed to provide a more accurate response.
