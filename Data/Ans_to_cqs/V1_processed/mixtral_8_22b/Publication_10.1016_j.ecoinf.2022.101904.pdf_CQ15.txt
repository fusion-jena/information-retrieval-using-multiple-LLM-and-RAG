Unfortunately, there isn't any explicit information about the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context. However, based on common practices in deep learning models, popular optimization algorithms include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), or their variants. These methods help minimize the loss function during the training process. Without further details, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the optimization technique used in this particular case.
