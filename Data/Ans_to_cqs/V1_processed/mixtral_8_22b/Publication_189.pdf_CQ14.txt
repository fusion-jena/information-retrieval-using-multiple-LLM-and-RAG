The given context does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, it mentions specific values for certain hyperparameters such as the learning rate, alpha (Î±), and the number of epochs used during training. It also specifies the versions of TensorFlow, Keras, and Python used, as well as the hardware configuration (1 GPU).

Unfortunately, without more detailed information regarding the optimization process, we cannot definitively state whether techniques like grid search or random search were employed. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, we do not have enough information to determine the method used for hyperparameter optimization.
