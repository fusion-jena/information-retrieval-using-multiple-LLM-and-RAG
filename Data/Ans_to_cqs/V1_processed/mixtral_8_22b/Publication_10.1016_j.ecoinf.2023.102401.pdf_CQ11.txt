Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no explicit mention or reference to any specific data repository links related to the deep learning pipeline discussed. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer to this query. It would require additional information or resources to accurately determine the relevant data repository link.

Based on the context, it appears that several datasets were used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model called YWnet. These datasets include the trash-ICRA19 dataset, the VisDrone dataset, the NWPU VHR-10 dataset, and the HRSID dataset. However, the context does not provide any information about where these datasets can be accessed or downloaded.

It is important to note that when sharing research findings, researchers often publish their code and datasets on platforms such as GitHub, Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. However, without further information or access to the original research paper or documentation, it is impossible to determine if the authors have shared their deep learning pipeline or datasets on any of these platforms.

Therefore, I recommend searching for the original research paper or contacting the authors directly to obtain more information about the availability of the deep learning pipeline and associated datasets.
