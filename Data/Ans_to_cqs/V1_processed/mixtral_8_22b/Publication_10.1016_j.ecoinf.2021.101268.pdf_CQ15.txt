The paper titled "Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization" by Kingma and Ba discusses the use of the Adam optimizer in stochastic gradient descent algorithms. This method is commonly used in deep learning pipelines to improve convergence rates and reduce training time. Other popular optimization techniques include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), which updates model parameters iteratively based on the gradients of the loss function, and Momentum, which helps accelerate SGD in relevant directions and dampens oscillations. Additionally, other adaptive learning rate methods such as Adagrad, Adadelta, and RMSprop have also been proposed to further enhance the performance of deep learning models.
