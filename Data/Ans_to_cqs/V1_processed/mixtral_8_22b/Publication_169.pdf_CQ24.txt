Based on the provided context, there isn't any explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, we can infer from general practices in deep learning that techniques like setting a fixed random seed or employing deterministic algorithms could be used to manage randomness. These methods help ensure reproducibility and consistency across different runs of the same model. Additionally, performing multiple runs with different seeds and averaging results can also mitigate the effects of randomness. Nonetheless, without specific details regarding the approach used in this study, these suggestions remain speculative.
