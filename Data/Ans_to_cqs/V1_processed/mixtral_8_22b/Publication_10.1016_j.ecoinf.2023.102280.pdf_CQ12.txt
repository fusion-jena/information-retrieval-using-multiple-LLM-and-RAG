The text mentions two types of deep learning architectures used in noise reduction methods: U-Net and Transformer attention mechanisms.

U-Net is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that was originally developed for biomedical image segmentation tasks. It has since been adapted for various other applications, including noise reduction in audio signals. The U-Net architecture consists of an encoder and a decoder section. The encoder compresses the input into a lower-dimensional latent space representation, while the decoder reconstructs the original signal using this latent space.

Transformer attention mechanisms, on the other hand, are based on the self-attention mechanism introduced by Vaswani et al. (2017) in their paper titled "Attention Is All You Need." They have been successfully applied to various natural language processing tasks and have recently gained popularity in the field of bioacoustics. Unlike traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, transformers do not rely on sequential processing of inputs. Instead, they process all inputs simultaneously, allowing them to capture long-range dependencies more effectively.

Therefore, depending on the specific implementation, either a CNN-based U-Net architecture or a Transformer attention mechanism could be used in the pipeline for noise reduction in bioacoustic signals.
