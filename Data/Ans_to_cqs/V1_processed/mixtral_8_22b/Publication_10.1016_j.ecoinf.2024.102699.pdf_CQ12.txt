The paper uses several types of deep learning models in the pipeline, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) such as DenseNet-161 and ResNet-50, as well as Vision Transformers (ViTs) like ViT-S/16, ViT-B/16, and ViT-L/16. These models are employed for tasks related to sound event detection and birdsong classification.
