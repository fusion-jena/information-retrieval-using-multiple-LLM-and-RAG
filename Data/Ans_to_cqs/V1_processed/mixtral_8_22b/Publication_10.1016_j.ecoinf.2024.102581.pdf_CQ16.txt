Based on the given context, there isn't a specific criterion mentioned for determining when training is complete. However, we can infer from the information about the accuracy and loss curves that these metrics play a crucial role in evaluating the model's performance during training. Typically, training continues until the model reaches optimal performance, often indicated by a stable or plateauing validation loss. In this case, the accuracy curve shows improvement with increasing epochs, suggesting that the model's classification performance improves over time. Similarly, the loss curve would ideally decrease and eventually stabilize, indicating reduced errors in predictions. Therefore, monitoring both accuracy and loss trends can be useful in deciding when to stop training. Additionally, techniques like dropout can be employed to improve the model's generalization and prevent overfitting, ensuring it adapts well to unseen data.
