Unfortunately, based on the given information, there isn't any explicit mention of which specific deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch were used to build the deep learning models discussed. However, we do see references to certain architectures like YOLOv7, Res2Net, and Efficient Layer Aggregation Network (E-ELAN), which suggest that the developers might have utilized libraries compatible with these architectures. For instance, YOLOv7 could be implemented using popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. But without further details, it's not possible to definitively state which frameworks were employed.
