The specific purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, based on the general usage of deep learning models, they are often used for tasks like image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, natural language processing, speech recognition, etc. In the context of remote sensing and agriculture, deep learning models could potentially be used for crop type identification, yield estimation, disease detection, land cover mapping, among other applications. The context mentions TensorFlow, which is a popular open-source library for machine learning and deep learning, capable of handling various types of neural networks and computations. It also mentions PyTorch, another widely used open-source machine learning library, known for its flexibility and ease of use. Both libraries support a wide range of deep learning architectures and applications.
