The context does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some general strategies can be mentioned. One common approach is setting a fixed random seed before running any code involving random processes, ensuring reproducibility across different runs. Another strategy involves using deterministic algorithms when possible instead of stochastic ones. Additionally, techniques like cross-validation and ensemble methods can help mitigate the impact of randomness on model performance.
