The information provided does not explicitly state the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, including details about model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer based on the given context. However, typically, after training a deep learning model, the next steps would involve saving or serializing the model, which converts the model into a format that can be stored and reused later. This could be done using various methods such as pickling in Python or saving the model weights. Afterward, the serialized model is deployed onto a suitable platform depending on its intended use case. For instance, if the model is meant for real-time predictions, it might be deployed on a cloud-based platform like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure. Unfortunately, without further context, I cannot determine the exact deployment process for this particular deep learning model.
