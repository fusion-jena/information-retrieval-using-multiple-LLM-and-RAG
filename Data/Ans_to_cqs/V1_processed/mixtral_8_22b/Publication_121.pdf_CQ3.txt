Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that some form of labeling or classification has been done since the dataset is split into a training set and a testing set. Additionally, the context mentions that the dataset consists of images, but it does not specify whether any particular type of annotation technique like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation was employed during the creation of the dataset.
