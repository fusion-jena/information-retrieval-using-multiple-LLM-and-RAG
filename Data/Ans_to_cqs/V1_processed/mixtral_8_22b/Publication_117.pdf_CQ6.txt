The text does not provide explicit details about the specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the YOLO DCNN was used with pretrained weights from the COCO dataset provided by Redmon & Farhadi (2018). This suggests that some form of transfer learning was applied, where a previously trained model is fine-tuned for a new task. Additionally, the images were tiled into 864 x 864 subimages, indicating that resizing or cropping might have occurred during preprocessing. Unfortunately, without further information, it cannot be determined if other common preprocessing techniques like normalization, scaling, or cleaning were also performed.
