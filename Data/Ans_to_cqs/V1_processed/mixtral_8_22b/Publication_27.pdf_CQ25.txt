The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific purpose or type of the deep learning model being used. However, based on the context, we can infer that the deep learning model is likely used for image analysis tasks such as object recognition, semantic segmentation, or anomaly detection. This is because the context mentions images and their corresponding labels, which are often used in training deep learning models for these types of tasks. Additionally, there are references to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a popular architecture for image-based deep learning models. Without more specific details, it cannot be definitively stated what the exact purpose of the deep learning model is.
