In the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific optimization techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the general concept of iteratively improving the model through backpropagation and updating its parameters based on the loss function's gradients. This implies that some form of optimization technique is indeed employed, but without further details, one cannot definitively state whether it is SGD, Adam, or another method.
