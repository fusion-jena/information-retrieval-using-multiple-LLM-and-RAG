The given context does not provide information about the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the input image sizes were 299 x 299 x 3 and 224 x 224 x 3 pixels, which suggests that some form of resizing or scaling might have been applied during preprocessing. Additionally, the use of convolutional neural networks implies that the images underwent spatial transformations such as flipping, rotation, and cropping. Nevertheless, without explicit mention of these techniques in the context, we cannot confirm their application.
