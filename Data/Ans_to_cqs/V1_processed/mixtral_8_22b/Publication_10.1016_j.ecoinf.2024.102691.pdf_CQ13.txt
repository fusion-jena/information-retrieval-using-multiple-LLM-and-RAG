The deep learning model described in the given context uses a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer for training. The initial learning rate is set to 0.01, and the cycle learning rate is 0.2. Other hyperparameters mentioned include the input image size, which is set to 512 x 512, and the maximum batch size, which is limited to 4. Additionally, the models follow back-propagation after accumulating the batch size 32 times to prevent underfitting.
