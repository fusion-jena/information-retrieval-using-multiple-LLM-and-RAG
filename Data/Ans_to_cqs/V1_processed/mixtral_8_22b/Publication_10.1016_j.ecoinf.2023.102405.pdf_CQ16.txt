Based on the provided context, it appears that the training process involves multiple epochs, where each epoch consists of iterations over all the mini-batches of the training dataset. The number of epochs can be determined by setting a maximum limit or by monitoring specific metrics such as validation loss or accuracy. In this case, there isn't explicit information about how many epochs were used or what criteria were employed to stop the training process. However, common practices include stopping the training when the validation loss stops decreasing significantly (validation loss plateau) or when the validation accuracy reaches a satisfactory level. Additionally, early stopping can also be implemented to prevent overfitting, which occurs when the model performs well on the training set but poorly on unseen data due to memorization rather than generalization. Early stopping involves halting the training process if the validation metric does not improve after a certain number of epochs.
