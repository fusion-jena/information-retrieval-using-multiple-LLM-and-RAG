During the training process, the model was monitored using several evaluation metrics including precision, recall, F1 score, GIoU, and mean Average Precision (mAP). These metrics were calculated based on the model validation data, which consisted of 321 image tiles. The F1 score and mAP score followed each other closely throughout the training process, providing insights into the model's progress at different stages. Initially, the model rapidly attained F1 and mAP scores of approximately 0.4 before continuing to improve at a slower pace. By the conclusion of the training, the model had achieved an accuracy level characterized by F1 = 0.530 and mAP = 0.557. Additionally, the steady decrease in GIoU indicated that the model became increasingly proficient at accurately identifying target locations.

To summarize, the strategy employed to track the model's performance during training involved utilizing multiple evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, GIoU, and mAP. These metrics offered valuable insights into the model's development over time, enabling continuous monitoring and optimization of its performance.
