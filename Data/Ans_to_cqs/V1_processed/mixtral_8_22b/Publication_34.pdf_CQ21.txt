After the model training process, there are several postprocessing steps that can be taken depending on the specific requirements of the project or analysis. In this case, predictions are made for every species of E50 using the trained models. Several model performance metrics are then calculated for each species and for two disjoint and randomly sampled subsets of sites: a train set and a test set. These sets aim to test the models' generalization capabilities. The performance metrics include mean loss, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC). Additionally, saliency maps may also be generated to visualize the importance of different features in making predictions. However, the text does not explicitly mention confusion matrices as part of the postprocessing steps.
