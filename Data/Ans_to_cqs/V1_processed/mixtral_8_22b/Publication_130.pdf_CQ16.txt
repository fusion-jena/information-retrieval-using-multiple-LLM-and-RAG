The text does not explicitly state the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions that the model is trained for 10 epochs initially and then evaluated based on its performance. If the model performs poorly, additional pictures are manually labeled and added to the training dataset. This process is repeated until a satisfactory performance is achieved. Additionally, the text suggests that the validation dataset is used to assess the learning progress of the neural network and to check if the model is overfitting the training data. Therefore, it can be inferred that the completion of training may depend on achieving satisfactory performance on the validation dataset and avoiding overfitting.
