After the model training, there are several postprocessing steps that can be taken depending on the specific requirements of the project. However, some common postprocessing steps include calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate the performance of the model. Additionally, creating confusion matrices can provide insight into which classes the model is struggling with or performing well on. Visualizing saliency maps can also help understand what parts of the input data the model is focusing on when making predictions. In this case, it appears that the authors used a non-maximum suppression (NMS) threshold of 0.7 during testing, which suggests that they may have applied NMS as a postprocessing step to filter out overlapping bounding boxes predicted by the Faster R-CNN model.
