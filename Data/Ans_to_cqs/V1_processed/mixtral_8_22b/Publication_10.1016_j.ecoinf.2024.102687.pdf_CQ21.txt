Unfortunately, the given context does not provide explicit details about any specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, confusion matrix, etc. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based solely on the provided context. However, generally speaking, these types of postprocessing steps can be used to evaluate and interpret machine learning models. For instance, saliency maps help visualize important features contributing to the model's decision, while metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves, etc., aid in evaluating the performance of the model. Additionally, confusion matrices offer insights into the correct and incorrect classifications made by the model.
