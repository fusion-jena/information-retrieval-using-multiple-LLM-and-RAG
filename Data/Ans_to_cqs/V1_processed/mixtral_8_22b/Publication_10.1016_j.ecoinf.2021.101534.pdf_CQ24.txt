Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention or discussion about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some general strategies used in machine learning and deep learning pipelines to manage randomness include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, employing cross-validation techniques, and utilizing ensemble methods. These strategies help ensure consistent results across different runs and improve the robustness of models.
