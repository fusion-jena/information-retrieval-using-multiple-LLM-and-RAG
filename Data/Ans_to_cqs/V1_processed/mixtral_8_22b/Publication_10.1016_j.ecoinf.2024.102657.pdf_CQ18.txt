The text does not provide explicit information about the strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions that the goal was to apply minimal preprocessing to demonstrate the power of human-machine teaming. Additionally, it states that the accuracy of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was assessed by comparing its performance on noise-filtered data vs. raw data, resulting in similar accuracy levels. This suggests that monitoring the model performance might have involved evaluating the accuracy of the CNN using different types of input data. Nevertheless, without more specific details, it cannot be definitively stated what exact strategy was employed to monitor the model performance during training.
