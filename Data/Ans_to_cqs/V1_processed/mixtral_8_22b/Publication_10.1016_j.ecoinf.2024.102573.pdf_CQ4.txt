The text mentions several data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline for audio waveforms. These include changing audio speed, pitch shift, amplitude scaling (also known as gain modulation), and adding Gaussian noise. However, it's important to note that while these techniques were found to enhance the generalization capabilities of neural networks, they were less effective than expected when applied solely to the waveform. The authors suggest exploring time-frequency augmentation techniques, such as applying Gaussian noise to the backend's input, which might yield better results due to the reduction of noise through smoothing. Additionally, the authors recommend focusing on'sensible transformations' that maintain the physical meaning of time-frequency representations.
