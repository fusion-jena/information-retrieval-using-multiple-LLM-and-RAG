The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in this context is for image classification. Specifically, it is designed to classify underwater images into one of six environmental condition classes. This is evident from several statements throughout the text, such as "environmental condition classification models" and "classifying the videos into the six environmental condition classes." Additionally, the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the mention of a confusion matrix further support this conclusion, as these are common tools used in image classification tasks.
