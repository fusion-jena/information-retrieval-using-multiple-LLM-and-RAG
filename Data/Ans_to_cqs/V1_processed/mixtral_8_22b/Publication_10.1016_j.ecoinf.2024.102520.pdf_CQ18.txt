The given context does not provide information on the specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, it can be inferred that the study employs Kriging interpolation techniques to predict total nitrogen (TSN) and phosphorus (TSP) concentrations based on various soil and site parameters. To ensure the accuracy of these predictions, the authors mention using extensive sampling to reduce sample error and increase Kriging accuracy. Additionally, they discuss the importance of proper parameter settings to prevent false or incorrect spatial dependencies. Therefore, while there is no explicit discussion of monitoring strategies, one could infer that the researchers might have monitored their models by evaluating prediction accuracy through cross-validation methods or other suitable metrics.
