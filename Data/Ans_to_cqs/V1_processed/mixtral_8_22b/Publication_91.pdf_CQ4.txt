The deep learning pipeline employed several data augmentation techniques to improve the robustness and generalization of the classifier. These techniques include flipping the images horizontally and vertically, adjusting brightness by 12.5%, adjusting saturation by 50.0%, adjusting contrast by 12.5%, and adjusting hue by 20%. These methods help create variations in the original dataset, allowing the model to learn from diverse examples and improving its ability to accurately identify new instances.
