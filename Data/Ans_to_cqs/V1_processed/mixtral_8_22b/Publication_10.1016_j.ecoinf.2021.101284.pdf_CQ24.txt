Unfortunately, there isn't any direct information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or setting specific values for random seeds in the given context. However, I can provide some general strategies used to manage randomness in machine learning models, including deep learning pipelines.

Randomness in deep learning pipelines often arises due to factors such as weight initialization, shuffling training examples, dropout regularization, and other stochastic processes. To ensure reproducibility and consistency across experiments, researchers employ several techniques:

1. Fixed Random Seeds: Setting a fixed random seed value ensures that the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers will be generated each time the code runs. This helps maintain consistent behavior between different executions of the same program. In Python, this can be done using functions like `numpy.random.seed()` or `torch.manual_seed()`.

2. Deterministic Algorithms: Some algorithms have deterministic versions that do not rely on random number generation. For example, when sorting arrays, one can use a deterministic sorting algorithm instead of a randomized quicksort implementation.

3. Version Control: Keep track of all dependencies, libraries, and software versions used during development. This includes specifying exact version numbers in requirements files or environment configurations.

4. Documentation: Clearly document every step taken during the experiment, including hyperparameters, dataset splits, evaluation metrics, etc. This makes it easier to reproduce results and understand the impact of various design choices.

While these strategies help reduce variability caused by randomness, they may also limit the exploration of diverse solutions. Therefore, it is essential to strike a balance between controlling randomness and allowing enough variation to discover better models.
