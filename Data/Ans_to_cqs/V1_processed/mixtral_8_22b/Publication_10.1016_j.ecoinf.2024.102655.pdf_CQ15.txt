The given context does not provide specific information on the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, or others. However, it mentions several machine learning models like Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. It also discusses the use of Artificial Bee Colony and Back Propagation Neural Network algorithms, but no explicit mention of optimization techniques within the deep learning pipeline is made. Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot determine what optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline.
