The given context does not provide information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipelines mentioned. However, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and landmark annotation. These techniques help label the input data, which is crucial for training machine learning algorithms like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) such as GoogleNet, ResNet, and ResNeXT mentioned in the context.
