To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, various techniques can be employed. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes or labels in both subsets. This ensures that the model does not become biased towards any particular class due to uneven representation in the training set.

Oversampling is a technique used when dealing with imbalanced datasets where one class significantly outnumbers another. It involves duplicating samples from the minority class until it reaches a more balanced ratio with the majority class. Alternatively, synthetic examples can also be generated using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).

Undersampling, conversely, reduces the number of instances in the majority class to achieve balance between classes. However, this may lead to loss of valuable information if important patterns exist within the discarded samples.

Lastly, collecting diverse data helps mitigate bias introduced by limited sources or demographics represented in the dataset. By incorporating varied perspectives and characteristics, models trained on such data will likely generalize better across different populations and scenarios.

These techniques aim to improve fairness and accuracy in deep learning models by reducing potential biases stemming from unrepresentative or skewed datasets.
