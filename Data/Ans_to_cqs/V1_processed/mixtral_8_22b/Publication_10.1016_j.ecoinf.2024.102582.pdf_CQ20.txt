The given context does not provide specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform is utilized for large-scale remote sensing image classification. The GEE platform offers superior storage and computing capabilities, which suggests that powerful hardware resources such as GPUs or TPUs might have been employed for training the models. Nevertheless, without explicit details regarding the hardware resources used, we cannot definitively state whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware components were involved in the training process.
