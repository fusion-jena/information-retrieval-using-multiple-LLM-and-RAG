Unfortunately, based on the given information, there isn't any explicit mention of a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the research paper. However, there is a reference to a dataset called 'Cactus Aerial Photos', which might contain the necessary data for the deep learning pipeline. This dataset seems to have been created by Vasquez-Gomez, but no direct link to its location is provided within the text. Therefore, without additional context or resources, it is not possible to determine the exact data repository link for the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the paper.
