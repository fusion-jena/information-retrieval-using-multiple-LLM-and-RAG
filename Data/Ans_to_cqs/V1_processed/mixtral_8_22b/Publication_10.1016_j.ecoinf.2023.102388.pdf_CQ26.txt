To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets or strata based on certain criteria such as class labels. Each subset is then split into training and validation sets while maintaining the original distribution of classes. This ensures that each subset contains a representative sample of all classes, reducing any potential bias towards one class.

Oversampling is another technique used to balance datasets by increasing the frequency of minority classes. This can be achieved through various methods such as random oversampling, synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), and adaptive synthetic sampling (ADASYN). Random oversampling simply duplicates instances from the minority class until they match the majority class count. SMOTE generates new synthetic examples along the line connecting neighboring points in feature space, while ADASYN creates synthetic samples using density distribution information.

Undersampling, conversely, reduces the frequency of majority classes to achieve balanced datasets. Techniques like random undersampling, NearMiss, and Condensed Nearest Neighbor (CNN) rule are commonly used. Random undersampling removes instances randomly from the majority class until their count matches the minority class. NearMiss selects only those majority class instances closest to the minority class boundary, whereas CNN eliminates redundant instances from both classes.

Lastly, collecting diverse data helps mitigate biases inherent in existing datasets. By gathering data from multiple sources, demographics, geographical locations, etc., we can create a more comprehensive representation of real-world scenarios. Additionally, augmentation techniques like rotation, scaling, flipping, cropping, and color jittering can further diversify our dataset.

These techniques collectively contribute towards minimizing data bias during preprocessing stages of the deep learning pipeline. However, choosing the appropriate method depends largely on factors such as dataset characteristics, problem complexity, computational resources, and desired outcomes.
