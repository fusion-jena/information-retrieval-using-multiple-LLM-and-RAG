The given context does not provide specific information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, based on common practices in machine learning, some possible measures could include using a diverse dataset, implementing cross-validation techniques, or employing stratified splitting during training and testing phases. Cross-validation is often used to assess how accurately a predictive model will perform in practice, while stratified sampling can help maintain the original class proportions when creating subsets from the main dataset. Without explicit details, though, these remain speculative suggestions rather than definitive answers.
