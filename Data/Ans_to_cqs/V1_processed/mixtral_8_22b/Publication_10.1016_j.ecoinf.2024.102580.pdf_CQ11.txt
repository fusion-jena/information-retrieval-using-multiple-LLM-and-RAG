The data repository link of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, there is a reference to a GitHub repository where the deep learning and post-processing scripts, along with the 2012 aerial imagery and data output used in this study, can be found. The URL provided is <https://git.wur.nl/deep-learning-tools-for-marine-ecosystem-monitoring>. This suggests that the deep learning pipeline may not have been published on a traditional data repository platform such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF but rather on a code hosting platform like GitHub.
