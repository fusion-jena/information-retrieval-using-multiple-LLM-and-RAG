The purpose of the deep learning model discussed here is classification. Specifically, this model is designed to conduct Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) analysis using a deep neural network. The goal is to accurately identify various land cover forms based on their spectral signatures. The model uses a convolutional neural network with several key components including an input layer, convolutional layer, pooling layer, fully connected layer, and output layer. These layers work together to process and analyze spectral information from satellite images, ultimately producing a spatial map of land use and land cover. In other words, the model takes in multispectral image data and outputs a classified map indicating what type of land cover or land use exists in each area.
