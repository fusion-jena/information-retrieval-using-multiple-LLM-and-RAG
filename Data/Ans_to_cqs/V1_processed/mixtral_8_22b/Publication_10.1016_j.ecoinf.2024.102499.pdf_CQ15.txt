The text does not provide explicit information about the specific optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that a learning rate of 0.008 was used with a cosine learning rate decay. These are both common strategies employed when using optimization algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. Therefore, while it cannot be definitively stated which optimization algorithm was used, it can be inferred that either SGD or Adam could have been utilized due to the mention of these optimization strategies.
