The sources provided do not directly address the specific methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, they do provide some examples of data collection methods used in ecology and environmental management studies. These include point-count surveys with observers, line-transect surveys, automated bioacoustic recorders, and useful bioindicators such as plants or animals. Additionally, the source mentions using RStudio, which is an integrated development environment for R programming language, often used for statistical computing and graphics. In general, raw data can be collected through various means depending on the application, including manual observations, sensor networks, satellite imagery, public datasets, and more.
