Before training a deep learning model, various preprocessing steps can be applied to improve its performance. Some common preprocessing techniques include:

1. Normalization: This involves rescaling input features so they fall within a specific range, typically between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. Normalization helps prevent certain features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process.

2. Scaling: Similar to normalization, scaling also adjusts feature values but does not necessarily restrict them to a fixed range. Common methods for scaling include standardizing (subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation) and min-max scaling (rescaling features to lie between 0 and 1).

3. Cleaning: Data cleaning involves identifying and handling missing, inconsistent, or erroneous data points. Techniques for dealing with these issues may include removing problematic instances, imputing missing values using statistical measures like mean or median, or employing more advanced algorithms like KNN or regression models.

4. Feature engineering: This step involves creating new features based on existing ones to better capture underlying patterns in the data. Examples include polynomial expansion, binning, and encoding categorical variables into numerical representations.

5. Dimensionality reduction: In cases where high-dimensional datasets pose computational challenges or lead to overfitting, dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) can help reduce the number of input features while preserving essential information.
