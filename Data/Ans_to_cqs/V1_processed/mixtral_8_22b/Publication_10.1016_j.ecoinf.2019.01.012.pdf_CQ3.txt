The given text does not provide explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in this particular deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that some form of labeling or classification was applied to the nearly 30,000 samples mentioned. In general, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangles around objects within an image to identify them. Semantic segmentation involves assigning a category to every pixel in an image, while instance segmentation involves identifying individual instances of objects within an image. These techniques help the model understand what objects are present in an image and where they are located.
