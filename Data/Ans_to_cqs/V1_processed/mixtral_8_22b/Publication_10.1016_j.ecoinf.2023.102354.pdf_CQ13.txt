Unfortunately, there is no information available regarding the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model mentioned in the provided context. The text only discusses the application of deep learning algorithms for understanding groundwater-climate interactions and identifying climatic hotspots within sub-basins of the Great Artesian Basin (GAB) region. It also describes methods for calculating drought characteristics such as severity, duration, and intensity but does not provide any details about the implementation of the deep learning models themselves. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information on the hyperparameters used in this particular case.
