Based on the given context, there isn't any specific information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, some common strategies to manage randomness in deep learning pipelines include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using techniques like cross-validation, bootstrapping, or bagging to reduce variance, and employing ensemble methods to combine multiple models trained with different initializations. These strategies help improve the robustness and reliability of deep learning models when dealing with random factors such as random seed values.
