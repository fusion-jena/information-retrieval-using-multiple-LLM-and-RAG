Data augmentation techniques are not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, some common data augmentation techniques applied in deep learning pipelines include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, shearing, and translating images. These techniques help increase the size of the dataset and improve the generalization ability of the model by creating variations of existing samples. For instance, image flipping involves horizontally or vertically reversing the pixels of an image; rotation involves rotating the image by a certain degree; scaling changes the size of the image; cropping cuts out parts of the image; zooming magnifies the image; shearing distorts the image along one axis; and translation shifts the position of the image within the frame. Each technique can be applied individually or combined with others to generate diverse variations of the original sample.
