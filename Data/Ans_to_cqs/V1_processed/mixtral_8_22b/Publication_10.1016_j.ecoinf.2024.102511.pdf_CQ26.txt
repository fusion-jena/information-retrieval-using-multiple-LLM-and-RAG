The text does not provide explicit information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions some general approaches that can be applied to tackle this issue. For instance, the text suggests that neural networks usually need substantial sample sizes for all classes, which implies that having balanced datasets could help mitigate potential biases. Additionally, the reference to Shorten and Khoshgoftaar (2019) indicates that data augmentation methods might also play a role in addressing data imbalance or bias. Furthermore, the mention of combining disparate datasets hints at the possibility of employing diverse data collection strategies to improve dataset representativeness. Lastly, while not explicitly mentioned, stratified sampling, oversampling, and undersampling are common techniques used to handle class imbalances and data bias in deep learning pipelines.
