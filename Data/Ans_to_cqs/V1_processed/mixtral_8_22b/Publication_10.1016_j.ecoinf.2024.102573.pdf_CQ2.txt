The text does not explicitly state what data format is being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the data format used is audio. The experiment mentioned involves using learnable frontends with filters applied to signals, which suggests that the input data is likely audio signals. Additionally, the discussion mentions tasks involving extracting joint temporal and spectral information from a signal, further supporting the idea that the data format used is audio. Therefore, it can be concluded that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is most likely audio.
