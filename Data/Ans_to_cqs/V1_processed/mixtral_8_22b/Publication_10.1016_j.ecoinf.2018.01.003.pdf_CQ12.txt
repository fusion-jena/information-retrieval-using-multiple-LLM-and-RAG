The given context does not provide specific details about the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It only mentions that since 2006, deep learning algorithms have gained popularity in academia and industry, breaking the limitations of traditional neural networks regarding the number of layers. These deep learning algorithms are trained with large-scale data to obtain deeply hidden characteristics and features beyond imagination before. However, no explicit mention of any particular deep learning model like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers is made in the provided context.
