Three main evaluation metrics are used to assess the performance of the deep learning model in this study. The first one is the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), calculated using Equation (2) in the paper. It involves comparing the SNR of the original signal and the denoised signal using a manually selected noise region (N) and a region containing the feature (S). The second metric is the Success Ratio (SR), outlined in Equation (3). SR measures the change in variance of the original and denoised signals, assuming that effective denoising should lead to a decrease in variance. Lastly, the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) is employed, defined by Equation (4). PSNR is the ratio between the maximum signal power (MAXsig) and the noise floor represented by the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the original and denoised signals.
