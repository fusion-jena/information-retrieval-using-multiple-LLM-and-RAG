The given context does not provide specific information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The sources mentioned in the context include scientific articles and papers, but they do not explicitly state the location or platform where the dataset used in their research can be accessed. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the availability of the deep learning pipeline's data repository. It would be best to consult the original authors or publications for further clarification on this matter.
