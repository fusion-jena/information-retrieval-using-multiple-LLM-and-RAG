The text does not provide explicit information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, it mentions that the models were built using Keras 2.4.3, which supports saving models in several formats such as HDF5, TensorFlow SavedModel, and JSON/H5. These saved models can be deployed on different platforms depending on the requirements. Additionally, the evaluation was conducted on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080Ti GPU with 11GB memory, running Windows 10 and Python 3.7, suggesting that the platform used for deployment might have similar specifications.
