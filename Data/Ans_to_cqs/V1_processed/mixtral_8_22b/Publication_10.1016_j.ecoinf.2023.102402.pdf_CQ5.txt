The provided context does not contain any specific information about the use of deep learning pipelines or the datasets used within them, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it focuses on various sources of data collection methods for obtaining information on seahorse species occurrences, including citizen science surveys, social media, diving centers, fishing events, and questionnaires. It also mentions the use of visual inspection via Google Earth Pro to verify the accuracy of reported occurrences based on known species distributions. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline based on the given context.
