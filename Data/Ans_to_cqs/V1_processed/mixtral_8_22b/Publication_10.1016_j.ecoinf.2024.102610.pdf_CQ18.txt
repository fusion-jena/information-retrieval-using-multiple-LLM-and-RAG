The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using two common variable elimination techniques for random forests: Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Variable Selection Using Random Forests (VSURF).

In RFE, the user defines a termination condition for model performance, and the algorithm iteratively removes one variable at a time while evaluating its impact on the modelâ€™s performance. This process continues until the algorithm reaches the best predefined level of model performance. In this study, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was used as the termination condition. As a result, RFE retained all variables whose removal led to a deterioration in the best RMSE value.

VSURF follows a three-step procedure, but specific details about its implementation are not mentioned in the given context. However, both methods aim to improve the model's performance by selecting relevant features and removing redundant ones, thus preventing potential performance degradation and avoiding overfitting.
