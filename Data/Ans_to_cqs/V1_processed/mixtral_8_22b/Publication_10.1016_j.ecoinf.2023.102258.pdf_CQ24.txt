The provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing the impact of random seed values. However, some common strategies include fixing the random seed value for reproducibility, using multiple runs with different seeds to average results, and employing techniques like ensemble learning or cross-validation to reduce variance caused by random initialization.
