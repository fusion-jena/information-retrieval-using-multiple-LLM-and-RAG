The authors conducted a correlation analysis of the variables before implementing the model to improve its predictive performance and mitigate the risk of overfitting. This suggests that they used variable selection techniques or dimensionality reduction methods to prevent multicollinearity among input features and reduce noise in the dataset. However, the text does not explicitly mention any specific strategies for monitoring the model performance during training, such as cross-validation, early stopping, or learning rate adjustments. Therefore, based solely on the given information, we cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the exact strategy employed by the researchers to monitor the model performance during training.
