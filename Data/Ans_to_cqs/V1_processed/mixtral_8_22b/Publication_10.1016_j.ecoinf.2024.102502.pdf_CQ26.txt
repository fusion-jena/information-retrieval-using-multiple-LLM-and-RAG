The given context does not provide specific details about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it discusses two important aspects of data processing - data filtering and data scaling.

Data filtering involves removing irrelevant features or instances from the dataset to improve model performance. This can help reduce bias caused by noisy or redundant data.

Data scaling, on the other hand, deals with normalizing or transforming data into a common range or format. It helps prevent certain features from dominating others due to their larger magnitudes, which could introduce bias. In the context provided, data scaling is discussed in relation to gap filling and data matching levels required by the user. Different scaling domains have been suggested by Fritsch et al. (2020), and the approach conforms to a 'pre-modelling scaling' protocol. Sequential processes were implemented within Google Earth Engine (GEE) for scaling up environmental time series from one spatial and/or temporal scale to another during data extraction.

While these techniques do not directly address data bias in the same way as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, they contribute to creating a cleaner and more balanced dataset, indirectly reducing potential sources of bias.
