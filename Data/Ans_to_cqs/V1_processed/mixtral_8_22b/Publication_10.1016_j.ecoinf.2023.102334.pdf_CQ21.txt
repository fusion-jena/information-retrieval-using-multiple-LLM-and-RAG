After the model training, several postprocessing steps were taken to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. One such step was the use of a confusion matrix to calculate the accuracy, precision, and other evaluation indicators of each category. The confusion matrix was normalized in the row direction, representing six categories. The true label denoted the actual image category of the sample, while the predicted label referred to the category output by the model. The value of the main diagonal position in the matrix represented the ratio of the model's correct predictions for each category. The sum of the data excluding the main diagonal position in each row represented the rate of missed detections of this model for this category. Another postprocessing step was the ablation and comparison experiments conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model. These experiments aimed to show the validity of the validation in this work, and the results were displayed in Table 2 and Figure 8.
