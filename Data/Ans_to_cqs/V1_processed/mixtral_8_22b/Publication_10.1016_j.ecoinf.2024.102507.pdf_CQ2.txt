The deep learning pipeline primarily utilizes image data formats. Specifically, the study employs Python's Rasterio module to disassemble multiband images into single-band images. For instance, 36-band images are broken down into 36 single-band images, while 72-band images are divided into 72 single-band images. This data conversion technique effectively reduces the dimensionality of the input data, thereby minimizing the computational requirements and processing time without significantly compromising the model's accuracy. Furthermore, the study mentions converting each forest type into 256x256 pixel image units using ArcPy to create deep learning samples. These operations suggest that the primary data format utilized in the deep learning pipeline is image data.
