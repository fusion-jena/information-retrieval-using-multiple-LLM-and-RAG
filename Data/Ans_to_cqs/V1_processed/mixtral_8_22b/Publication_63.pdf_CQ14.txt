The text does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, it mentions that a batch size of 20 images and an RMSprop optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 and a learning rate decay of 0.0001 were used. This suggests that these values were selected beforehand rather than through optimization methods such as grid search or random search. Therefore, based on the given information, it is unclear whether any hyperparameter optimization techniques were employed.
