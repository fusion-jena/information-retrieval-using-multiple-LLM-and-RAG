The article mentions that a deep learning model called Deep Neural Network (DNN) was used in the pipeline. However, it does not provide specific details about the architecture of the DNN, such as whether it uses convolutional layers like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), recurrent connections like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or attention mechanisms like Transformers. Therefore, while we know that a DNN was used, we cannot determine its exact type without additional information.
