Two metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model: classification accuracy and intersection over union (IoU). Classification accuracy provides a ratio of the correct classifications and all classifications, describing the percentage of correct classifications. However, for unbalanced datasets, this measure may not be very significant. To overcome this issue, a second evaluation metric called Intersection over Union (IoU) or Jaccard Index is used. This metric considers both false positives and false negatives, providing a more balanced assessment of the model's performance.

The paper presents the results of standard semantic segmentation analyses performed on two subsets of the Johnsbachtal data. For the Johnsbachtal camera dataset, the segmentation resulted in an accuracy of 88.56% and a mean IoU (mIoU) of 74.87%. The precision, recall, and F1-score were 78.22%, 68.26%, and 68.30%, respectively. On the other hand, the segmentation of the Johnsbachtal mobile phone dataset yielded an accuracy of 91.39% and a mIoU of 80.16%. The precision, recall, and F1-score were 80.58%, 81.54%, and 80.34%, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the deep learning models in accurately segmenting and classifying the given datasets.
