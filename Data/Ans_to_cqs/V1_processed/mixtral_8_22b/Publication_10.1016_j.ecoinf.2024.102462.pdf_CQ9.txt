The text does not provide specific information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that the data used for training the model should be representative of the problem and the annotations should be carefully generated. However, it does not specify where this data can be found or accessed. Therefore, I do not know where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
