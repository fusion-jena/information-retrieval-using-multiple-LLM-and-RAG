The given text does not provide information about the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. However, it mentions that AutoGluon, an open-source AutoML library, emphasizes advanced data processing, deep learning, and ensemble techniques. This suggests that AutoGluon might have been used to develop the deep learning model, but the exact frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch are not mentioned. Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot determine which frameworks were used to build the deep learning model.
