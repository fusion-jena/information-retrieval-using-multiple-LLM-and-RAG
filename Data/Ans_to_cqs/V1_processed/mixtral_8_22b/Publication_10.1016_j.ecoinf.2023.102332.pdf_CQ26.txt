The given context does not provide explicit information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions some general approaches related to handling multilingual data and dealing with large datasets. For instance, the authors translate all text descriptions into English using DeepL to handle multiple languages. They also mention using pre-trained models like baroni word2vec instead of training a new custom word2vec model to reduce computational effort and potential geographical bias. These methods do not directly address data bias but help manage linguistic diversity and computational resources. To specifically tackle data bias, one might consider stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection strategies, depending on the nature of the bias present in the dataset.
