Based on the given context, there isn't specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, generally speaking, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. These techniques help in identifying and classifying objects within images or videos, enabling machine learning models to learn patterns and make predictions.

Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects in an image and labeling them accordingly. Semantic segmentation involves assigning a label to every pixel in an image, while instance segmentation involves detecting individual instances of objects and their boundaries.

In the context of marine science, these techniques could potentially be applied to identify and classify different species of fish, track their movements, or analyze their growth patterns based on otoliths or other biological markers. However, without more specific information regarding the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer.
