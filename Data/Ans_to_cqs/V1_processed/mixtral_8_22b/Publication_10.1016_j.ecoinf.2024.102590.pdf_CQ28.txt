Based on the given information, it is not explicitly stated which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that Google Earth Engine (GEE) played a significant role in building an easy and efficient sampling strategy and export methodology. It also allowed different independent operators to collect training and test samples using a cloud-based server to run the analyses. From this information, we can infer that the deep learning model might have been deployed on the Google Cloud Platform since GEE is a part of the Google ecosystem. Nevertheless, without explicit confirmation, we cannot definitively state that the deep learning model was deployed on the Google Cloud Platform.
