The study utilizes several remote sensing data sources available on the Google Earth Engine platform, including the 16-day synthesized MOD13Q1 V6 NDVI dataset (MODIS NDVI), the daily NOAA Climate Data Record (CDR) of AVHRR NDVI V5 dataset (CDR AVHRR NDVI), and the third generation GIMMS NDVI from AVHRR sensors dataset (GIMMS NDVI). Additionally, SPOT/VEGETATION products (SPOT NDVI), administrative divisions, and DEM datasets are sourced from the Resource and Environmental Data Center. These datasets provide valuable information such as vegetation indices, climate records, and geographical features, which are essential for various environmental studies. However, it is important to note that each NDVI product has its own strengths and weaknesses due to factors like temporal resolution, spatial resolution, cloud cover, and surface information. Therefore, careful selection of suitable NDVI products based on specific research requirements is crucial.
