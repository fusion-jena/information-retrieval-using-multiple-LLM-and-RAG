The authors do not provide explicit information about how they optimize the hyperparameters of their models. They mention using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for image analysis but do not discuss specific optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot determine the method used for hyperparameter optimization.
