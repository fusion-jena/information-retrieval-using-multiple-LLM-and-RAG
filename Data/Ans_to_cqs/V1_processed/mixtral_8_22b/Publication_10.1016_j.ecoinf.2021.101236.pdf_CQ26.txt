The text does not provide explicit information on specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions diversifying the training data, which could be a strategy to mitigate data bias. This is achieved through a data augmentation method enabled by the 3-s window length implementation. Data augmentation can help improve the diversity of the dataset and reduce overfitting. Additionally, the overall process followed current best practices in deep learning, which often include strategies to handle data imbalance or bias. These may include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, although these methods are not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
