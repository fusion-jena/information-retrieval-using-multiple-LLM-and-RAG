The article does not provide information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The authors mention using optical imagery datasets organized into large-scale temporal habitat maps but do not specify where these datasets are stored or made accessible. Therefore, it is unclear whether the data used in this study has been deposited in any public repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. To find out more details regarding the dataset, one would need to contact the corresponding author(s) directly or refer to other related publications by the same research group.
