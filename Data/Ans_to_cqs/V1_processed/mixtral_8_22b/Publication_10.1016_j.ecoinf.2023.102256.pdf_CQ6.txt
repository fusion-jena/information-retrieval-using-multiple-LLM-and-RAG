Based on the given context, there isn't explicit mention of specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred from general practice in deep learning that some common preprocessing techniques might have been applied. These could include:

1. Normalization or Scaling: This involves adjusting values measured on different scales to a common scale. In image analysis tasks like this one, pixel intensities may be scaled to lie within a small specified range, often [0, 1] or [-1, 1].

2. Cleaning: This step involves removing noise from the dataset. For instance, if the audio recordings used to generate the spectrograms contained background noises irrelevant to bird sounds, those would ideally be filtered out during preprocessing.

3. Data Augmentation: While not explicitly mentioned, data augmentation is another common technique used in deep learning to increase the amount of training data available. It involves creating new examples by applying random (but realistic) transformations to existing ones.

4. Embedding Space Between Words: Although this phrase appears in the context, it seems more related to natural language processing tasks rather than image classification tasks. Therefore, it likely doesnâ€™t apply here.

Without further details about the exact preprocessing steps taken, these points provide a reasonable guess based on typical practices in deep learning projects.
