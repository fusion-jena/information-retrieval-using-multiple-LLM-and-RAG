The paper does not provide explicit information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions performing a sensitivity study by training models using different proportions of training data (5%, 25%, 50%, and 75%) compared to the full dataset for within-site results for each site. This suggests that they may have used some form of performance metric or convergence criterion to decide when training was sufficient. Unfortunately, without more detailed information about their training process, it is impossible to definitively state what criteria were used to determine when training was complete.
