Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention any strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, specifically regarding random seed values. However, one common strategy used in machine learning and deep learning pipelines to manage randomness is setting a fixed seed value before running experiments. By doing so, researchers ensure reproducibility and consistency across multiple runs of the same experiment.

Additionally, another approach to handling randomness is using ensemble methods like Random Forest Regressor, mentioned in the context. Ensemble methods combine multiple base learners to improve overall performance and reduce variance caused by randomness. In the case of Random Forest Regressor, it uses bagging (bootstrap aggregating), where each tree in the forest is trained on a randomly sampled subset of data points and features. This introduces controlled randomness into the model, allowing it to capture diverse patterns and generalize well to unseen data.

While the context does not directly discuss strategies for managing randomness related to seed values, it highlights the importance of employing robust algorithms like Random Forest Regressor to mitigate the impact of randomness on model performance.
