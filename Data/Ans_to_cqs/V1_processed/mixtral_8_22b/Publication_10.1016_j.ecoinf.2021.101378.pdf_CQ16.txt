Based on the given context, it appears that the authors use a combination of accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve values to evaluate the performance of their models. However, there is no explicit mention of how they determine when training is complete. Typically, in machine learning, training can be stopped when the validation loss plateaus or stops improving significantly. This indicates that the model has learned all it can from the training data and further training may lead to overfitting. Without more specific information about the training process used by the authors, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this question.
