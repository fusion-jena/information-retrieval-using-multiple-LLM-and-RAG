The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using the L-BFGS-B method, which is a quasi-Newton approach used for resolving functions with simple constraints. In this particular case, the constraints ensured that the weights were both positive and not greater than one (0 <= wj <= 1). The L-BFGS-B method was implemented through the use of two R packages: 'topois' and'stats'. However, it should be noted that the specifics regarding how the hyperparameters were selected for optimization, such as whether they were chosen via grid search or random search, are not explicitly mentioned within the given context.
