The paper does not provide explicit information on specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred from the methodology section that the authors used diverse datasets, including images captured under different conditions such as varying light intensities, water turbidity levels, and fish densities. This approach helps improve the robustness and applicability of the model across various real-world scenarios. Additionally, the use of cross-validation techniques, such as k-fold cross-validation or leave-one-out cross-validation, could have been employed to further validate the performance of the model. Nevertheless, without clear evidence presented in the paper, we cannot definitively state whether these methods were utilized.
