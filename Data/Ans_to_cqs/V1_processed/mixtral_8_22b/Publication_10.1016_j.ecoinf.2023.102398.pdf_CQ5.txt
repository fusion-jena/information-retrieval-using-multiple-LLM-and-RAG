The research paper uses a publicly available dataset named Animal2-v1 from Roboflow. This dataset comprises 9952 images belonging to seven animal classes: Bear, Deer, Elephant, Leopard, Monkey, Tiger, and Wild-boar. All the images are annotated in YOLOv5 PyTorch format. For preprocessing, the dataset applies auto-orientation of pixel data with EXIF-format stripping, and the images are resized to 416 Ã— 416 (stretch). The dataset distribution includes 70% of images for training, 20% images for validation, and 10% images for testing. No image augmentation techniques are applied.
