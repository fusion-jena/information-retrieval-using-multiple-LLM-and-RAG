The text does not provide explicit information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, it mentions that they utilized transfer learning by initializing an ImageNet pre-trained ResNet34 model and applying data augmentation techniques. They then trained the model with a learning rate of 10^-3 for ten epochs. After achieving satisfactory results, they used the trained model to automatically classify 500 more images from the unlabeled training dataset and manually fixed any mistakes. This process was repeated until all 7362 downloaded images were labeled. Unfortunately, there is no mention of specific details regarding model serialization or platform selection for deployment.
