The given context does not provide specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on common practices in deep learning pipelines, some possible data annotation techniques could include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, or instance segmentation. These techniques help label the input data with relevant information, such as object locations or class labels, which is essential for training deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Without explicit mention of the data annotation techniques used in this study, it is difficult to determine which specific method was employed.
