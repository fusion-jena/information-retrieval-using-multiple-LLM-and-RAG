The given context does not provide information on the specific data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotation, or scaling. Data augmentation techniques are methods used to increase the amount of training data by applying random transformations to existing images, which can help improve model performance and prevent overfitting. However, without more details about the specific study or research being conducted, it cannot be determined what data augmentation techniques were used.
