The text does not explicitly mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it does provide information about neural network architectures commonly used for semantic image segmentation, such as UNet and DeepLabV3. Both UNet and DeepLabV3 are convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures designed specifically for semantic segmentation tasks. Therefore, it can be inferred that the pipeline likely uses a CNN-based deep learning model for its image analysis tasks.
