The deep learning model used in the given context is DeeplabV3+, which is implemented using PyTorch. The weights for this model were obtained from an already trained implementation available on GitHub (<https://github.com/zllrunning/deeplab-pytorch-crf>), which uses the COCO dataset for training. Therefore, the framework used to build the deep learning model is PyTorch.
