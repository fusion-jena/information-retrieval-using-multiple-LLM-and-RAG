The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices. However, it can be inferred that since the models mentioned in the context are primarily used for prediction purposes, some common postprocessing steps could include evaluating the performance of these models using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves, etc. Additionally, depending upon the application domain, other postprocessing techniques might also be employed. For instance, if the model is being used for image classification tasks, then generating class activation maps or saliency maps would help visualize which parts of the images were most influential in making predictions. Similarly, if the task involves multi-class classification problems, creating a confusion matrix would provide insights into how well the model is able to distinguish between different classes.
