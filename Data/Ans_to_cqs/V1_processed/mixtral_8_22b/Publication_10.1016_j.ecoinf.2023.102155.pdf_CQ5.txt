The given context does not provide information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine which datasets were used in this case.

Based on the provided context, it appears that the study focuses on predicting intensity maps using various machine learning techniques such as knn, LoopT, and others. The results are presented for different percentages of hidden observations (20%, 50%, and 80%) and combinations of lasso regularization and bias correction. However, there is no mention of any specific dataset being used in these experiments.
