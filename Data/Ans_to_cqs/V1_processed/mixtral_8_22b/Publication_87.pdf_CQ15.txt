The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on common practices in deep learning, popular optimization algorithms include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp), and others. The choice of optimization algorithm depends on various factors such as convergence speed, computational efficiency, and robustness to hyperparameters. Without further details from the authors, it is impossible to determine which optimization technique was employed in their deep learning pipeline.
