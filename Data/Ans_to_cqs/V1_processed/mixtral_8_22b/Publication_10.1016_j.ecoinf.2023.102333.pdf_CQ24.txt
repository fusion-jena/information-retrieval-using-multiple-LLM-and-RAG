The text does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it mentions the use of Random Search (RS) as an optimization method in Machine Learning and AI applications. RS is a simple yet effective optimization technique that selects and evaluates a set of hyperparameters randomly to find the configuration with the best performance.

In this context, one strategy to manage randomness could involve setting a fixed random seed before running the Random Search algorithm. By doing so, researchers ensure reproducibility and consistency across multiple runs or experiments. Additionally, fixing the random seed allows other researchers to reproduce results accurately.

Moreover, the Dropout layer mentioned in the text serves as another strategy to address randomness in deep learning models. Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly removes different sets of neurons during each iteration of training, effectively creating various neural networks. Consequently, Dropout reduces overfitting and improves generalization by minimizing co-adaptations between neurons.

To summarize, while the given context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, we can infer two potential strategies based on the information provided: setting a fixed random seed for reproducibility and employing Dropout as a regularization technique to mitigate the effects of randomness during training.
