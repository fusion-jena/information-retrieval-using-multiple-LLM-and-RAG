Based on the given context, it appears that the deep learning model was evaluated using a validation dataset, as shown in Figure 13. However, the context does not provide explicit information about any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, I cannot definitively state what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
