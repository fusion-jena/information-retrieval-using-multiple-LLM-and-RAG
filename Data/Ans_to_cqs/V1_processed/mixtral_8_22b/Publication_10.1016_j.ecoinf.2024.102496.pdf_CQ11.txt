Based on the given information, there is no direct mention of a deep learning pipeline or its corresponding data repository link. However, it appears that all the data used in the study is available in the supplementary document. Additionally, there are two tools mentioned - the Equitable Nutrient Reduction Decision Support Tool and the Equitable Nutrient Reduction Decision Support Tool Map Package. These tools might contain the deep learning pipeline, but without further clarification, it cannot be confirmed. Therefore, I am unable to provide a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline based on the given information.
