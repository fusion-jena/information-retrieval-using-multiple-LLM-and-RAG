The purpose of the deep learning model in this case is for classification. Specifically, the authors have developed a system called DialectDecoder that utilizes both a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm to classify bird songs based on their dialect types. This is evident from the fact that they mention creating a metadata.csv file listing all the necessary classification information for training the CNN and k-NN. Furthermore, they state that each folder containing bird songs is labeled with the dialect type and the year it was collected, indicating that the goal is to classify these bird songs into different categories based on their dialects.
