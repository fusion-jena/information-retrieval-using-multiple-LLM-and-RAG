The text does not provide explicit information regarding the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (i.e., train, test, validation sets). However, it is common practice in machine learning to use a random stratified sampling technique or a chronological split when dealing with time series data. The latter might be more appropriate given the nature of the problem discussed in this paper - predicting drought propagation times using historical data. Typically, the data would be divided into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to fit the model; the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting; and the testing set is used to evaluate the final performance of the trained model.

Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the authors employed a sliding window method with a window size of 30 years and a step size of one year to generate forty-two distinct datasets. While the exact distribution of these datasets into training, validation, and testing sets is not mentioned, it is reasonable to assume that they followed standard practices in machine learning to ensure reliable results.
