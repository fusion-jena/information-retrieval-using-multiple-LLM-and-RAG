The information provided does not explicitly mention a specific data repository for the deep learning pipeline. However, it lists several resources such as Resource and Environment Science and Data Center (<http://www.resdc.cn>), National Meteorological Science Data Center (<http://data.cma.cn>), Harmonized World Soil Database (<https://www.fao.org/soils-portal/data-hub>), and Geospatial Data Cloud (<http://www.gscloud.cn/>). These resources may contain relevant datasets used in the study or similar studies. To find out if these resources host the specific dataset related to the deep learning pipeline mentioned in this study, I recommend visiting each resource's website and searching for the dataset using keywords or contacting their support team for assistance. Unfortunately, without more specific details about the deep learning pipeline or the dataset, I cannot provide a direct link to the exact location where the dataset might be stored.
