Based on the given context, the deep learning pipeline primarily utilizes image data format. Specifically, the input images are scaled down to a fixed size (512 Ã— 512) with normalization using self-adaptive image scaling. Additionally, the context mentions the use of RGB images and depth images, which are also types of image data formats. There is no mention of other data formats like audio, video, or CSV being used in this particular deep learning pipeline.
