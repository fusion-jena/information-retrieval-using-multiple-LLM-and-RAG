The text does not explicitly state what specific type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline. However, given that the input data consists of 64 x 64 2D tensors, which suggests image or grid-like data, it is likely that a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is being employed. CNNs are particularly well suited for processing such structured data due to their ability to automatically extract relevant features through convolution operations. Nevertheless, without further clarification from the source material, we cannot definitively confirm that a CNN is indeed the chosen model.
