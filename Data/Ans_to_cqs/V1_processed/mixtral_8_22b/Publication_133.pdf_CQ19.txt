Based on the given information, it is not explicitly stated which specific frameworks were used to build the deep learning model. However, there is a reference to a GitHub repository for YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once version 5), which is a popular object detection algorithm. This suggests that the authors may have used this framework or similar ones like TensorFlow or PyTorch to develop their deep learning model. Unfortunately, without more explicit details, we cannot definitively determine which frameworks were utilized.
