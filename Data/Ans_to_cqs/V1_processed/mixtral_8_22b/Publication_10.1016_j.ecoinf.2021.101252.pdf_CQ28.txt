The given context does not provide information about which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. It only mentions that 'ecologists will likely have to move in the same direction as their fellow computer scientists and embrace faster hardware (e.g., GPUs, 'tensor processing units' and large-resourced cloud computing services)' and that'scalable model implementations (e.g., distributed computing)' may be necessary due to the computational demands of deep learning. However, no explicit mention is made of any particular cloud service provider such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
