The provided context does not explicitly mention specific methods for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that various types of data may be collected depending on the application. For instance, the use of Best Management Practices (BMPs) suggests that data related to water quality, such as pollutant loads or nutrient levels, might be gathered through monitoring systems like sensors or sampling techniques. Additionally, references to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and their Watershed Boundary Dataset indicate that publicly available geospatial data could also be incorporated into the dataset. Other potential sources of information include surveys, satellite imagery, or historical records. Nevertheless, without further details regarding the specific deep learning pipeline mentioned in the query, it is difficult to provide a definitive list of data collection methods.
