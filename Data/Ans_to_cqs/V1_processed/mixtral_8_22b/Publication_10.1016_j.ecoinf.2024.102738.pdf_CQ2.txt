The information provided does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is implied that the datasets used are related to remote sensing imagery due to references to spectral bands, vegetation indices, soil indices, water indices, clusters, and various combinations of these inputs. Additionally, there is a reference to Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classes, which suggests that the data might be used for land cover classification tasks. Based on this context, it would be reasonable to infer that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is likely raster images, such as those obtained from satellite or airborne sensors.
