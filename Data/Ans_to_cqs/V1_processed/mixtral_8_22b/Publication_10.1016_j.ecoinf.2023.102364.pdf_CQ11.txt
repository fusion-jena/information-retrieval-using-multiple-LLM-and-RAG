The article does not explicitly mention the use of a deep learning pipeline or any specific data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. However, it mentions that the data used in this research is available through an Open Access format. The Google Drive link provided in the abstract leads to a folder containing various datasets related to the study, but it doesn't seem to be a recognized data repository like those mentioned in the query. Therefore, there isn't enough information to determine if the deep learning pipeline, if one was used, is stored on a specific data repository.
