The given context does not provide information regarding the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context primarily focuses on the use of a few-shot learning method involving two-way one-shot learning for training a Siamese network. It also mentions the evaluation of animal tracking and provides several references related to deep learning applications in ecological studies. However, without explicit details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, it is impossible to determine which ones were employed.
