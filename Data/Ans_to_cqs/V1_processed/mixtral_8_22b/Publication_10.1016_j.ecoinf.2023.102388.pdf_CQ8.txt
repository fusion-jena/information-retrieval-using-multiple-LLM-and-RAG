Unfortunately, based on the given information, there isn't any explicit mention of where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It could be hosted on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket, among others, but without further details, it's impossible to provide a definitive answer.

However, one reference mentioned in the context is Skalski, P., 2019. Make Sense. <https://github.com/SkalskiP/make-sense/>. This suggests that the author might have shared some related work on GitHub, although it doesn't confirm if it includes the exact deep learning pipeline referred to in the context. To find out more about the availability of the code repository, additional research would be required.
