In the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the parameters listed in Table 3, it can be inferred that some form of regularization might have been applied. For instance, the 'decay' parameter could refer to weight decay, which is another term for L2 regularization. Additionally, the presence of 'hidden\_dropout' and 'visible\_dropout' parameters suggests that dropout regularization has been employed. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent overfitting. It is important to note that these assumptions are based solely on the naming conventions of the parameters and not explicitly stated in the provided context.
