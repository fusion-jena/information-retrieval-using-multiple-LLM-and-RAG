In the given context, it is mentioned that the researchers conducted transfer learning by first training on the ImageNet dataset and then further training the network on a small simulated camera-trap dataset. ImageNet has 1.3 million labeled images for 1,000 categories, including both synthetic objects and wildlife categories. This dataset is commonly used in computer vision research, including research into transfer learning. Additionally, the researchers created labeled datasets of different sizes from SS data. However, no other specific datasets like MNIST or CIFAR are explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
