The deep learning model mentioned in this study was developed using TensorFlow, an open-source platform for deep learning. This framework provides tools for building and deploying machine learning models, including those based on artificial neural networks. It offers APIs for Python, Java, and Go programming languages, making it versatile and accessible for developers working across different platforms. TensorFlow also supports distributed computing, allowing users to leverage multiple CPUs or GPUs for faster processing and improved scalability.
