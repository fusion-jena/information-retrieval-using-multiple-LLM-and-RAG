The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses the application of machine learning techniques, specifically Random Forests (RF), to classify maturity in Chilean hake based on extensive data. Given that the focus is on reproductive condition in fish, it can be inferred that the data might include biological or physiological measurements related to the fish species. These could potentially be in various formats such as numerical values (CSV files) or images (for histological analysis). Nevertheless, without more detailed information about the exact nature of the data used in the study, it is not possible to definitively state the specific data formats employed in the deep learning pipeline.
