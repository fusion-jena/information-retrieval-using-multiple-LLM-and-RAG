Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no information about the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, common metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, area under the curve (AUC), mean squared error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). These metrics can help assess different aspects of the model's performance, depending on the problem being addressed. For example, accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of total predictions made; precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made; recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of actual positives; F1 score combines both precision and recall into one metric; AUC represents the degree or measure of separability; MSE, RMSE, and MAE are commonly used regression evaluation metrics.
