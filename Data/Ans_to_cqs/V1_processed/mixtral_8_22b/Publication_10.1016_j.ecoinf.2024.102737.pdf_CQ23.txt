To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, various measures were taken. Firstly, the dataset was diverse, consisting of 21 different individuals (classes) each having 4 different 320 Ã— 320 pixels images. This diversity helped in capturing variations within the same class, thereby improving the model's ability to generalize. Secondly, the test size included 99 other labeled images of the individuals that appeared in the training set. This allowed the model to be tested on new instances of known classes, further validating its generalization capabilities. Lastly, the images in both the training and test sets varied in their poses and other image characteristics, such as contrast, brightness, etc. This variation in the dataset helped the model to learn robust features that can handle real-world variabilities, thus enhancing its generalizability. However, specific methods like cross-validation or stratified splitting do not appear to be explicitly mentioned in the given context.
