The article does not provide specific details about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the proposed model was tested on three fish families with a large number of species and obvious interspecific variations. It also states that the limitations of obtaining DNA barcode sequences of fish species from different families and the problem of overfitting in small datasets were addressed using Elastic Net. Therefore, it can be inferred that the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline consisted of DNA barcode sequences of fish species from different families. Unfortunately, no further details regarding the specific names or sources of these datasets are mentioned in the given context.
