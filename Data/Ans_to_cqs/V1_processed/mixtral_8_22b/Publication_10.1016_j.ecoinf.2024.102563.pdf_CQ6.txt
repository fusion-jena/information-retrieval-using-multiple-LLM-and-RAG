The papers referenced do not provide specific information on the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, common preprocessing steps include data cleaning, which involves removing or correcting erroneous data; data normalization, which scales numeric columns to a standard range to prevent differences in scales from influencing outcomes; and data transformation, such as converting categorical variables into numerical ones through encoding techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding. These preprocessing steps help improve the performance and efficiency of the deep learning models.
