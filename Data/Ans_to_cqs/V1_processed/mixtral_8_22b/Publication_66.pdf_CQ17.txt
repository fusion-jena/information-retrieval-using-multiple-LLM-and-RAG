Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does state that a random hyperparameter search was conducted to determine the optimum model structure. This could potentially include various regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Unfortunately, without more detailed information about the hyperparameters searched, we cannot definitively identify which regularization methods were employed.
