The purpose of the deep learning model used in this study is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, based on the description of the research methodology, it can be inferred that the model might have been used for feature selection or classification purposes. Specifically, the researchers used a machine learning algorithm to select important video factors related to the number of views. This suggests that the model could have been employed to classify these factors and identify their significance in predicting viewership. Nevertheless, without further details about the type of machine learning algorithm used, it cannot be definitively determined whether the model served a classification, segmentation, or detection function.
