Based on the given context, there isn't enough information to directly address the query about what criteria are used to determine when training is complete. However, generally speaking, common criteria used to determine when training is complete in machine learning models can include reaching a certain number of epochs, achieving a desired level of accuracy or loss, or observing no significant improvement in validation loss over several epochs (validation loss plateau). These criteria may vary depending on the specific model and dataset being used. In the context of species distribution models, similar criteria could potentially apply, such as monitoring changes in performance indices like ΔAUC, ΔDenv, and ΔDgeo, and stopping training when these metrics reach a satisfactory level or show minimal improvement over multiple iterations.
