The information provided does not explicitly mention where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, based on common practices in the field, it can be assumed that the authors might have made their code publicly accessible through popular version control platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. To find out if this is the case, one could search for the relevant papers by Ibrahim et al. (2018) and Kahl et al. (2021) on these platforms or check the respective paper's supplementary materials section for any links to the source code repositories. Unfortunately, without more specific details about the project or its authors, we cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the location of the code repository.
