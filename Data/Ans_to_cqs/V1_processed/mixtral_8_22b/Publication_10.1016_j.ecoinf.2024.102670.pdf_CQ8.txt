The paper does not provide information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that Sharma et al. (2017) used crowd-sourcing to obtain manual annotations and Xu et al. (2021) developed a Convolutional Neural Network-based segmentation model. However, there are no details given regarding the availability of the code repositories for either of these studies.
