Based on the given context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily uses audio data. This is evident from the mention of various animal vocalizations, such as those of the Sika Deer and Red Deer, as well as the use of Kaleidoscope, a software tool designed for analyzing bioacoustic signals. Furthermore, the context discusses the use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) window sizes, which is a common technique used in signal processing, including audio analysis. Additionally, the context mentions the evaluation of the recognizer's performance based on the recall rate and precision, which are metrics often used in evaluating the performance of audio recognition systems. Therefore, it can be concluded that the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is audio data.
