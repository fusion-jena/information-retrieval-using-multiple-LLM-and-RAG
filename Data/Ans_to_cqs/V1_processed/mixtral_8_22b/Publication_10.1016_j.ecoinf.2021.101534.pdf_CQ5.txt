Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in the deep learning pipeline. Instead, the authors have mentioned using their own custom dataset derived from soundscape recordings, which are typically much noisier than focal recordings. These soundscape recordings were transformed into spectrograms as input images for model training. The transformation process involved applying short-time Fourier transform (STFT) with a window size of 1600 samples, hop size of 400 samples (75% overlap), and 240 mel-scale frequency bins. As a result, each spectrogram had a height of 438 pixels and a width of 436 pixels. Therefore, based on the available context, we cannot provide the names of standard datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet used in this particular deep learning pipeline.
