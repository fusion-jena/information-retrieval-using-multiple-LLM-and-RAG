The experimental results section mentions several metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. These include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Bias Error (MBE). Additionally, their normalized counterparts MAE%, RMSE%, and MBE% are also calculated. However, it should be noted that these metrics are specific to regression tasks and may not be applicable to other types of deep learning tasks such as classification or object detection. For those tasks, different metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., might be used instead.
