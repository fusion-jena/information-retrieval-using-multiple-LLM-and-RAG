The text does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. However, it mentions that a Python implementation of the XGBoostClassifier was used, which is a gradient boosting framework that uses multiple weak prediction models, typically decision trees, to create a strong predictive model. Additionally, it states that optimized random trees were developed where each new tree learned from the errors of those previous. This suggests that some form of optimization was applied during the training process, but the exact details are not specified.
