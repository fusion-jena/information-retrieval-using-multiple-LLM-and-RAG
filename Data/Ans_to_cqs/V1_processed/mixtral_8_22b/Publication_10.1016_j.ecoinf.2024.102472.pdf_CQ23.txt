The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some indications that suggest certain practices might have been employed.

Firstly, the use of validation data implies that the model was tested on unseen data during its development phase. This practice helps prevent overfitting and improves the model's ability to perform well on new, previously unseen data.

Secondly, the mention of using a grid search method to tune hyperparameters suggests that cross-validation may have been used. Grid search involves trying out different combinations of hyperparameters and evaluating each combination based on its performance on a validation set. Cross-validation is often used in conjunction with grid search to get a more robust estimate of how well the model will perform on unseen data.

Lastly, while it is not explicitly stated, the fact that the study uses both XGBoost and ANN models indicates that multiple modeling approaches were explored. Using multiple models can help improve the overall reliability and validity of the findings by reducing the risk of relying too heavily on any one particular approach.

In summary, although the text does not directly state what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the use of validation data, grid search for hyperparameter tuning, and exploration of multiple modeling approaches suggest that steps were likely taken to enhance the model's applicability beyond the specific dataset used in this study.
