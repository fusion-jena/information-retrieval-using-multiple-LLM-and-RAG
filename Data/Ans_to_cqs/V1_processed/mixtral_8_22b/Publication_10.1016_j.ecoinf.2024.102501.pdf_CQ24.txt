Unfortunately, none of the given references directly addresses the issue of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, specifically regarding random seed values. However, some common strategies to manage this issue include:

1. Fixing the random seed: By setting a fixed random seed value before training the model, one can ensure reproducibility of results across multiple runs. This helps eliminate any variability introduced by the random initialization of weights and other factors.

2. Ensemble methods: Combining predictions from several independently trained models can help reduce the impact of randomness. Techniques like bagging, boosting, and stacking can be used to create ensembles of models, improving overall performance and robustness.

3. Cross-validation: Using k-fold cross-validation during model evaluation allows assessing the model's performance on different subsets of the data. This provides a more reliable estimate of its true performance and reduces the risk of overfitting due to random fluctuations in the data.

4. Hyperparameter tuning: Optimizing hyperparameters through techniques like grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization can lead to finding a set of optimal hyperparameters that work well across various random initializations.
