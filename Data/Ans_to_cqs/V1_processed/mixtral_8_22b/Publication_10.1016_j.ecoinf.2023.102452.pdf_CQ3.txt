The given context does not provide information on specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it is important to note that these techniques are commonly employed in various stages of the deep learning process, particularly in computer vision tasks involving object detection and recognition.

Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects within images to identify their location and size. This technique is often used when training models for object detection tasks. Instance segmentation, on the other hand, goes beyond simple bounding boxes by providing pixel-level accuracy in identifying individual instances of objects within an image. Both techniques play crucial roles in developing accurate and robust deep learning models for various applications.
