The given context does not provide information about the specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, it can be assumed that common strategies such as using validation datasets or cross-validation techniques were employed to evaluate the model's performance during training. These methods help prevent overfitting and ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data. Additionally, metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or loss functions could have been used to measure the model's performance. Without further details regarding the type of model being trained or the dataset used, it is difficult to provide a more precise answer.
