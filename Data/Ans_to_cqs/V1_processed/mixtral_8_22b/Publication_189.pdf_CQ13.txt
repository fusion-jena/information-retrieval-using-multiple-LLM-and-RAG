In the given context, there isn't explicit information about the specific optimizer used in the deep learning model. However, some hyperparameters can be identified. The learning rate, denoted as alpha (Î±), was set to 0.001 for the heads layer training. During the training of all layers, the learning rate decayed by 10. Additionally, the model was trained using 20 epochs with 500 steps each for training images and 100 steps for validation images. It should be noted that these parameters might not cover all the hyperparameters used in the model, but they provide insight into some aspects of the model's configuration.
