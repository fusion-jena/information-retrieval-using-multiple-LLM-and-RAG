The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using three metrics: accuracy, recall, and precision. Accuracy measures the ratio of correct predictions to the total number of predictions. Recall is a measure of false negatives, calculated by dividing the number of true positives by the sum of true positives and false negatives. Precision is a measure of false positives, calculated by dividing the number of true positives by the sum of true positives and false positives. In camera trap studies, precision is optimized when focusing on rare species such as lynx, while recall is optimized when focusing on common species like chamois and roe deer.
