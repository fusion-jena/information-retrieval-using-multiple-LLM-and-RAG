Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any specific optimization technique being applied in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, or others. However, it does discuss the application of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model which is a popular choice for sequence prediction tasks due to its capability to learn long term dependencies. It should be noted that while training LSTM networks, various optimization algorithms like SGD, Adam etc. could be employed but without further information, we cannot definitively state which one was used in this particular case.
