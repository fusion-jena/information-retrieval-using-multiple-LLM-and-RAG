The provided context does not directly mention specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the issue of overfitting in general and its impact on model precision.

Overfitting occurs when a model learns the detail and noise in the training data to the extent that it negatively impacts the performance of the model on new data. This means that the noise or random fluctuations in the training data is picked up and learned as concepts by the model. The problem is that these concepts do not apply to new data and negatively impact the modelâ€™s ability to generalize from the training data to unseen data.

In the context of deep learning pipelines, there are several regularization methods used to prevent overfitting. Dropout is one such method where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to make the model more robust and prevents overfitting. Another common method is L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, which adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the sum of the squares of all the weights in the network. This encourages smaller weights, leading to simpler models that generalize better.

Other techniques mentioned in the context include using a subset of the available data for training, rather than the entire dataset, to avoid overtraining and precision loss. Data transformation methods, such as variational mode decomposition, have also been used to decompose water quality data into stable components for training a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network, resulting in improved prediction accuracy.
