Data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include pitch shifting, time shifting, and adding Gaussian white noise. Pitch shifting involves changing the frequency of the audio signal without altering its duration or content. Time shifting involves moving the start point of the audio signal forward or backward in time. Adding Gaussian white noise involves introducing random noise to the audio signal. These techniques help increase the amount of training data available and improve the robustness of the model.
