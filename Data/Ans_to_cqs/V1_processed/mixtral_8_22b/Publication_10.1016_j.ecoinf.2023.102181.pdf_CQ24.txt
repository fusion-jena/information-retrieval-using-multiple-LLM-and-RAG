The provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, including the use of random seed values. However, it does touch upon related concepts in the context of machine learning models, particularly bagging models like Random Forest.

In the context of bagging models, randomness is inherently introduced through the process of bootstrapping, where multiple subsets of the original dataset are created by randomly selecting instances with replacement. Each subset is used to train a different model, and the final output is obtained by combining the outputs of all individual models. This introduces variability into the modeling process, helping to avoid overfitting and improving overall performance.

While the context does not provide specific strategies for managing randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it suggests that leveraging randomness through techniques like bootstrapping can improve model performance and generalizability. To manage randomness in the deep learning pipeline, similar strategies might include setting random seeds for initialization, shuffling datasets before splitting them into training and testing sets, and employing techniques like dropout regularization to introduce controlled randomness during training.
