The given context does not provide information on which specific frameworks were used to build the deep learning models mentioned such as MAXENT or ANN. However, popular frameworks for building deep learning models include TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and Caffe among others. Without additional context, it is impossible to determine which framework was used for these particular models.

The context provided discusses various machine learning techniques used for modeling species distribution including MAXENT, RF, ANN, MARS, GBM, CTA, FDA, and SRE. It also mentions TÃ¼rkiye's forests and their environmental layers. However, there is no mention of any specific deep learning framework used to build these models. Therefore, based solely on this context, we cannot definitively state which frameworks were used to build the deep learning models.
