To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed. One common approach is to use fixed random seeds across multiple runs or experiments. This ensures that any observed differences between models are due to changes in the model architecture, hyperparameters, or training data rather than random initialization. Another strategy is to perform multiple runs with different random seeds and report average performance metrics along with their standard deviations. This helps quantify the variability introduced by randomness and provides a more robust estimate of model performance. Additionally, techniques such as batch normalization and dropout can help reduce overfitting and improve generalization by introducing controlled noise into the network during training. Finally, it's important to note that some degree of randomness may actually benefit certain aspects of deep learning, such as exploration in reinforcement learning or optimization algorithms like stochastic gradient descent. In these cases, carefully tuning the amount of randomness can lead to improved performance.
