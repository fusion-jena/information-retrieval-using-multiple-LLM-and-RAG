The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, or validation sets. However, it does provide some information about the use of a modeling approach called Maxent, which was used to create species distribution models for two seahorse species, Hippocampus guttulatus and Hippocampus hippocampus.

In this study, the authors used the Akaike Information Criterion corrected for small sample sizes (AICc) to select the best model among several candidate models. They chose the model parameters with the lowest AICc values (Î”AICc = 0) for both seahorse species to establish the final Maxent models. This suggests that they may have used cross-validation techniques to evaluate the performance of their models and choose the best one based on its predictive accuracy.

While the context does not directly address the query regarding the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it provides some insight into the methodology used to develop and validate the species distribution models. It is possible that the authors used standard practices for splitting data into training, testing, and validation sets when developing their models, but without further information, we cannot confirm this.
