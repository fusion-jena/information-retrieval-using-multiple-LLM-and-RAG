The text does not explicitly state the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions that the training scores were calculated from the models fit on all 7331 grid cells, and their outputs for the area shown in Fig. 1a were compared to their true labels to compute the values. Additionally, the validation scores of the models were calculated through a 10-fold CV using one fold pattern of spatial-CV feature selection, shown in Fig. 2. These scores are the average of the 10 validation folds. From these details, it can be inferred that the completion of training might have been determined based on achieving satisfactory training and validation scores or reaching a certain number of epochs during the training process. However, without explicit information about the stopping criteria, it cannot be definitively stated what exact criteria were used to determine when training was complete.
