Based on the provided context, there isn't any explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, I can provide some general strategies often employed to manage randomness in deep learning models:

1. Fixed Random Seed: One common strategy is setting a fixed random seed value before running experiments or training models. This ensures reproducibility since the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers will be generated every time the code runs.

2. Multiple Runs: Another approach is to run the experiment multiple times with different random seeds and report average performance metrics. This helps mitigate the impact of random initialization and provides more robust estimates of model performance.

3. Data Shuffling: In many cases, shuffling the dataset before splitting it into training and validation/test sets can help reduce bias introduced by the order of samples.

4. Cross-Validation: Using techniques like k-fold cross-validation can also help minimize the effect of randomness by averaging model performance across different subsets of the data.

While these strategies aren't explicitly mentioned in the provided context, they are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to address randomness issues.
