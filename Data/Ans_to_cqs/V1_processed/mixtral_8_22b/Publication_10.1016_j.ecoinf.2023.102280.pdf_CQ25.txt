The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is primarily focused on noise reduction and denoising applications. Specifically, it aims to improve the quality of audio signals by reducing background noise and enhancing the desired signal. This is achieved through the use of architectures like U-Net, which consists of an encoder and decoder section. The encoder compresses the input into a latent space representation, while the decoder utilizes this representation to reconstruct the denoised waveform. Additionally, transformer attention mechanisms have been successfully employed in recent studies to further enhance the performance of these models. It should be noted that while these methods have shown promising results in various domains, they are predominantly tailored towards Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, particularly human speech enhancement. However, their potential extends beyond NLP, as evidenced by their successful application in areas such as source separation and classification using raw waveform data instead of spectrograms.
