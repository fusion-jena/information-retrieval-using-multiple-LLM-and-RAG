The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it mentions the use of Optuna, a hyperparameter optimization framework, which can help improve the model's performance and potentially its generalizability. Additionally, the authors mention evaluating the performance of the algorithms by comparing their loss functions (Mean Squared Error) and calculating Mean Absolute Error and Coefficient of Determination. These evaluation metrics can indirectly contribute to assessing the model's generalizability. Unfortunately, there is no direct mention of techniques like diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting being employed to enhance the model's generalizability.
