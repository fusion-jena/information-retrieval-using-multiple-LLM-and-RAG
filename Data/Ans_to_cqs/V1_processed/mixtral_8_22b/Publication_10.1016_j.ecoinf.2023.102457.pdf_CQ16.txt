Unfortunately, there isn't any information available regarding the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete in the given context. However, common criteria include reaching a certain number of epochs or iterations, achieving a desired level of performance on a validation set (such as a validation loss plateau), or observing no further improvement in performance after several consecutive epochs or iterations. These criteria can help ensure that the model has learned useful patterns without overfitting to the training data.
