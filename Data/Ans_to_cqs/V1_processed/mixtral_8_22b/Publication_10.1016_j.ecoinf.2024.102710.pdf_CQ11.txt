There isn't enough information in the given context to provide a direct link to the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that some studies have used datasets from sources like Macaulay Library and evaluated transfer learning models based on classification performance. It would be necessary to refer to the specific papers mentioned or contact the authors directly for the exact links to the data repositories used in their research.

Based on the context, here are some relevant GitHub repositories related to the topic:

* HKathman/pam_annotation_experiments
* kahst/BirdNET-Analyzer/tree/main/checkpoints/V2.4

These might not contain the actual dataset but could potentially lead to further clues about the data source or repository.
