In the given context, several types of data formats are mentioned as being part of the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, the dataset used in this study includes single-tree point clouds, images of single trees, and.csv files containing various attributes used to produce the images. Additionally, there is mention of clusters of numbers, labeled numbers, preprocessed images of the numbers, and tables containing the results of digit recognition. Therefore, it appears that the primary data formats used in this particular deep learning pipeline are images and.csv files. However, it should be noted that the use of these specific data formats may depend on the nature of the problem being addressed by the deep learning algorithm, and other studies or applications might employ different data formats such as audio or video files.
