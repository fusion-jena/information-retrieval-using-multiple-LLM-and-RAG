The text does not explicitly mention which specific frameworks are used to build the deep learning model. However, one can infer that the Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN) is employed as the underlying architecture for the model. While the text does not specify whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or another framework is used to implement Faster R-CNN, both TensorFlow and PyTorch offer pre-built modules for implementing this type of network. Therefore, either TensorFlow or PyTorch could potentially be utilized to develop the deep learning model described in the given context.
