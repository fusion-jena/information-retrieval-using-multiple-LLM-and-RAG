Unfortunately, there is no explicit mention or reference to where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in this study is available. It could be possible that the authors did not share the dataset publicly due to privacy concerns or other reasons. However, it would have been beneficial if they had shared the dataset along with the paper to ensure reproducibility and transparency. I recommend reaching out to the corresponding author or checking the supplementary materials section of the original publication for more details regarding the dataset.

Based on the given context, we can infer that the researchers used remote sensing Earth observation data to conduct Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) analysis using a deep neural network. They developed a classifier capable of accurately identifying various land cover forms based on their spectral signatures. The schematic representation of the process and example architecture of the convolutional neural network are also provided. However, there is no specific information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in this study.
