Hyperparameters of the model are optimized using the Hyperband method, which is inspired by the multi-armed bandit problem. This method is available in the Keras library. Hyperband is a hyperparameter optimization method based on the "successive halving" strategy. It explores several configurations in parallel while allocating more training resources to promising configurations. This allows for a more efficient search of the hyperparameter space, especially when computational resources are limited.

In summary, Hyperband combines an initial random search with a'successive halving' strategy to quickly identify promising configurations while eliminating those that show inferior performance. The details of the grid of possible combinations are presented, including the number of convolution layers, their size, and the associated max-pooling. These will be determined within specified intervals for each.
