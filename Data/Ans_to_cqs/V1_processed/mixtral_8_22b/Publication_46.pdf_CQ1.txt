The given context does not provide explicit information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer some possible methods based on the nature of the study and the mentioned tools.

Since the study focuses on tracking and mapping the plant species Rhododendron arboreum using different Species Distribution Models (SDMs), it is likely that the raw data collection involves field surveys or remote sensing techniques. Field surveys may include gathering geographical coordinates, altitudes, and environmental conditions related to the plant's habitat. Remote sensing techniques might involve utilizing satellite imagery or LiDAR data to capture relevant landscape characteristics.

Moreover, since the authors mention using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for their research, they probably use image datasets containing labeled examples of Rhododendron arboreum habitats. These images could come from publicly available datasets or custom datasets created specifically for this project.

However, without more specific details regarding the data collection process, these assumptions remain speculative. To get a definitive answer, one would need access to additional resources or contact the original authors for clarification.
