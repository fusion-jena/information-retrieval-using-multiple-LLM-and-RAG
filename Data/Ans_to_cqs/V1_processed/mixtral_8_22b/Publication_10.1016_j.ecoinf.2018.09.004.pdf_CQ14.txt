Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to determine how the hyperparameters of the models were optimized. The text mentions several types of classifiers used for binary classification, including k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, logistic regression, ridge, linear support vector classifier (SVC), random forests, and passive-aggressive classifier. However, it doesn't provide details on how the hyperparameters of these models were tuned or optimized. Common methods for hyperparameter optimization include grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and others. Without further information, I cannot specify which method was used for hyperparameter optimization in this case.
