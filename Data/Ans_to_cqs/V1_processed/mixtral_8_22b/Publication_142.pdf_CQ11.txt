The text does not provide explicit information about the specific data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the Pl@ntNet classification tool is accessible through a dedicated API available at <https://my.plantnet.org>. Additionally, the authors suggest following the TDWG standards, including Darwin Core, to share data via the GBIF portal (<http://www.gbif.org>). They also mention that the trained models require high-performance computing infrastructure and expertise in deep, distributed, and large-scale learning. Given these details, it is reasonable to infer that the deep learning pipeline might be hosted on a private or institutional server rather than being publicly available on a platform like Zenodo, Figshare, or Dryad. Nevertheless, without further information, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the exact data repository link of the deep learning pipeline.
