The query asks about strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline, specifically regarding random seed values. However, none of the provided references directly address this specific topic. Nevertheless, some general strategies for managing randomness in machine learning pipelines include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using cross-validation techniques, employing ensemble methods, and applying regularization techniques such as dropout or weight decay. These strategies help mitigate the effects of randomness and improve the robustness and reliability of the results. It is important to note that each strategy has its own advantages and disadvantages, and their effectiveness may vary depending on the specific application and dataset.
