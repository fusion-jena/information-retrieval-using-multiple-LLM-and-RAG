Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps may be required depending on the nature of the data. These can include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing or correcting any errors, missing values, or inconsistencies in the dataset. It also includes handling outliers which might affect the performance of the model.

2. Normalization or Standardization: This is done to bring all features to the same scale. In normalization, the data is scaled between 0 and 1 while standardization scales the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This is important because many machine learning algorithms perform better when numerical input variables are scaled to a standard range.

3. Feature Scaling: Similar to normalization, feature scaling ensures that each attribute has the same effect on the final result. Without this step, attributes with larger numeric ranges may influence the results more than those with smaller ranges.

4. Encoding Categorical Variables: Deep learning models cannot handle categorical data directly. Therefore, it needs to be converted into numerical form using techniques like label encoding or one-hot encoding.

5. Splitting Dataset: The dataset is usually split into three parts - training set, validation set, and test set. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters, and the test set is used to evaluate the final model.

6. Data Augmentation: This technique is often used for image datasets where new images are created from existing ones by applying random transformations such as rotation, zooming, etc. This helps prevent overfitting and improves the model's ability to generalize.
