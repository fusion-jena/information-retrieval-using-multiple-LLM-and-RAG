To monitor the model performance during training, the authors employed a strategy involving several steps. Firstly, they divided their dataset into two parts - a training set consisting of 80% of the data and a test set containing the remaining 20%. This division allowed them to train the models on one portion of the data and then test it on another, previously unseen portion. This approach helped ensure that the models could generalize effectively to new, unseen data.

Secondly, the authors utilized three standard metrics to evaluate the performance of their models: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Average Error (MAE), and the Coefficient of Determination (R^2). Among these, they primarily focused on minimizing the MSE to identify the optimal set of hyperparameters through a process called Grid Search.

Lastly, after training the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models, the authors calculated SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values using the model-agnostic Kernel SHAP method. This step aimed to comprehend which features were most significant in predicting the start and height of the greening season. By employing this comprehensive strategy, the authors ensured effective monitoring of their model's performance throughout the training phase.
