The study uses a combination of scientific foundations and the capabilities of Google Earth Engine (GEE) to determine the sample sizes for training and testing datasets. The authors rely on Chuvieco (2020), who suggests using at least 196 test points for categorical variables. However, they also consider that this number might be too small compared to the total number of pixels in the image. To address this issue, they explore alternative sampling strategies.

One such strategy is based on recommendations from Congalton (1991) and Hay (1979), which propose having at least 50 pixels per thematic class. In contrast to strictly distributing 196 training areas among the six thematic classes, the authors choose to use pure training areas containing at least 50 pixels in total and prominently representing the class of interest. They achieve this by implementing simplified random sampling (Chuvieco, 2020). This approach allows capturing variability within each class more effectively and improving overall classification accuracy.
