The given context does not provide specific details about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotation, or scaling. However, it discusses various aspects of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), including architectures like ResNet, EfficientNet, MobileNetV2, and InceptionV3, along with their components like shortcut connections, bottleneck architecture, global average pooling, and skip connections. Additionally, it mentions two approaches for training models, one involving Principal Component Analysis - Neighborhood Component Analysis (PCA-NCA) integration and another utilizing raw bivalve images as inputs to optimized pre-trained networks. Unfortunately, without explicit mention of data augmentation techniques in the provided context, I cannot accurately determine what methods were employed in the deep learning pipeline.
