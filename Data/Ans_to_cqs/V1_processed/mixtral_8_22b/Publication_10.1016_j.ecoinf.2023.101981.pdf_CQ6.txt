Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be taken to ensure optimal performance and accuracy. These may include data normalization, where the input features are scaled or transformed so they have zero mean and unit variance. This helps prevent any single feature from dominating the others due to its scale. Data cleaning is another important step, involving removing or correcting erroneous, missing, or inconsistent data points. Scaling might also be applied to adjust all values within a specific range, such as between 0 and 1, to maintain consistency across different datasets. In some cases, additional transformations like logarithmic scaling or standardizing data might be necessary depending on the nature of the problem being addressed by the deep learning model.
