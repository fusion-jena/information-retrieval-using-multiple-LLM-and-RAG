The text mentions several preprocessing steps taken before training a deep learning model. One such step is initializing the frontends with mel-filterbanks. This could be considered a form of feature extraction, where relevant features are extracted from raw audio signals to improve the performance of the model.

Another preprocessing step mentioned is log-compressing the outputs without normalization. Log compression is often used to reduce the dynamic range of the input signal, making it more suitable for processing by a neural network. In this case, it appears that no further normalization was performed after log compression.

The text also discusses the use of PCEN (Per-Channel Energy Normalization), which is a type of normalization technique. PCEN is described as being able to whiten the data by Gaussianizing the magnitudes and decorrelating the frequency bands. This helps to alleviate stationary background noise and makes the model more robust to changes in the input caused by different compression schemes.

Finally, the text notes that input normalization was applied on the backend's input, which is the frontend's output. Input normalization is a common preprocessing step in machine learning, where the input data is scaled or transformed so that it has zero mean and unit variance. This helps to ensure that the model converges faster during training and improves its overall performance.
