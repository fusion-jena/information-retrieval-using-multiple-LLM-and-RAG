Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of a dataset called CVIP100 for plant leaf classification. This suggests that one possible method for gathering raw data could involve using publicly available datasets like CVIP100 or other similar databases. Additionally, the paper mentions various studies that have employed different types of deep learning models such as DDYOLOv5, ResNet-50, Deep Attention Dense CNN, and dense convolutional neural networks for tasks related to image classification. These models typically require large amounts of labeled training data, which may come from sources such as online repositories, sensor readings, or manual labeling efforts. In summary, while the exact methods for collecting raw data aren't specified within this context, some potential approaches include utilizing existing datasets, leveraging sensor technology, or manually curating labeled examples.
