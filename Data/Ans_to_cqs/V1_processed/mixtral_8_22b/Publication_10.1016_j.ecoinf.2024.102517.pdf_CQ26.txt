The text does not provide information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this query based on the given context.

Based on the provided context, there is no mention of any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The focus of the context is on the framework of a bird sound noise reduction network based on deep feature loss, including its architecture and training process. There is also discussion on the limitations of traditional noise reduction methods and the potential benefits of using deep learning for bioacoustic noise reduction. However, there is no reference to addressing data bias specifically.
