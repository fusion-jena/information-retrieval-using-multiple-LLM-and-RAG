The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics such as precision, recall, and F-measure. The paper mentions that the deep learning method achieves a high F-score of 98%. Additionally, Table 3 presents the precision, recall, and F-measure values obtained for different test videos using the deep learning method with a threshold value of T=98%. Furthermore, Table 4 compares the F-measures of the deep learning method and another method called HOG+SVM, showing that the deep learning method consistently outperforms the other method across all test videos.
