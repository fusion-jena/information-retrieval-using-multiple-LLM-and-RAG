The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically EfficientNet-B7. This model was chosen due to its efficient scaling factors, making it suitable for handling images with varying resolutions and channels. The use of CNNs allows for the cascading of convolutional layers, enabling the network to process complex visual information effectively. In this case, the CNN was employed for both semi-supervised contrastive learning and weakly supervised modeling, contributing to the development of advanced underwater fish video processing techniques for turbid waters.
