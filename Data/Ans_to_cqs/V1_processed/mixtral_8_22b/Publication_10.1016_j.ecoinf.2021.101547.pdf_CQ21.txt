The given context does not provide information about any specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. However, generally speaking, postprocessing steps can include various techniques depending on the application and requirements. These may include generating visualizations like saliency maps to understand which parts of the input data were most important for the model's predictions, calculating performance metrics to evaluate the model's effectiveness, creating confusion matrices to analyze the types of errors made by the model, among others. But without further details regarding the specific use case or model architecture, it is impossible to determine exactly what postprocessing steps would be appropriate here.
