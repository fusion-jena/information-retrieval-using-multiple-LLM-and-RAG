While the given context does not directly discuss preprocessing steps for deep learning models, I can provide some general information about common preprocessing techniques used before training such models. Preprocessing involves preparing raw data into a suitable format for the algorithm to understand and learn from. Some commonly used preprocessing techniques include:

1. Data Cleaning: Removing or correcting erroneous data points, missing values, outliers, or inconsistent entries.

2. Normalization/Standardization: Scaling numeric features to have zero mean and unit variance or transforming them within a specific range (e.g., 0-1 or -1 to 1). This helps prevent certain features from dominating others due to their scale.

3. Feature Engineering: Creating new features by combining existing ones or extracting meaningful attributes from complex data types like text or images.

4. Encoding Categorical Variables: Converting categorical variables into numerical representations, such as one-hot encoding or label encoding.

5. Splitting Dataset: Dividing the dataset into training, testing, and sometimes validation subsets to evaluate model performance and prevent overfitting.
