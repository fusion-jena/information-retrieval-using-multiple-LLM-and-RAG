The deep learning pipeline described employs the AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017) during its training phase. This optimizer is a variant of the popular Adam optimizer, which combines the advantages of Adaptive Gradient Algorithm (AdaGrad) and Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp). AdamW further improves upon Adam by introducing decoupled weight decay regularization, making it more suitable for large scale learning problems.

In addition to selecting an appropriate optimizer, the learning rate is another crucial hyperparameter that needs to be carefully chosen. Here, the learning rate is set to 0.0001. Furthermore, a learning rate scheduler with exponential decay of 0.95 is employed to gradually decrease the learning rate over time, allowing the model to converge more smoothly towards the optimal solution.

Dropout is another technique mentioned in the context, although not directly related to optimization. Dropout is a form of regularization used to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping out units from the network during training.

However, there is no mention of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) being used in this particular deep learning pipeline.
