Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to determine what specific process was used to deploy the trained deep learning model. The given sources discuss various aspects of landscape ecology, such as modeling habitat suitability for different species, using multiple statistical methods like GLM, MaxEnt, RF, GBM, and MARS, and analyzing factors affecting habitat suitability. However, none of them explicitly mention any details about deploying a deep learning model or its related procedures, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, it is not possible to accurately answer the query based solely on the provided context.
