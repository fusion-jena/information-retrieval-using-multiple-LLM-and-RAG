Unfortunately, based on the given information, it is not possible to determine the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. The text does mention the use of the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model, which is known for its ability to handle large image datasets and identify features and patterns within them. However, there is no explicit mention of any specific hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer. It would be necessary to refer to additional resources or documentation related to this particular implementation of the XGBoost model to find out about the hyperparameters used.
