The text does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the given information whether grid search, random search, or another method was used for hyperparameter optimization.

Based on the provided context, we only have information about the performance comparison between the proposed method and the softmax function for accomplishing a certain classification task. It is mentioned that the proposed method ran in approximately 1.2 minutes on the CPU while the softmax took around 12 minutes on the GPU to complete the same task. However, there is no specific detail regarding the process of hyperparameter tuning or optimization methods employed in this study.
