To evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, several metrics are used. These include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Accuracy measures the overall correctness of the model by comparing the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions made. Precision measures the proportion of true positives (correctly identified positive instances) out of all instances predicted as positive. Recall measures the ability of the model to capture all the positive instances. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances these two factors. In this case, the authors also use a confusion matrix to further assess the performance of their model.
