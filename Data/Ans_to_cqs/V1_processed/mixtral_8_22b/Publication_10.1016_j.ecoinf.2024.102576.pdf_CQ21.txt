After the model training, several postprocessing steps can be taken to evaluate the performance of the model and interpret its predictions. Some common postprocessing techniques include saliency maps, metrics calculation, and confusion matrices.

Saliency maps are visualizations that highlight the regions of an input image that contribute most significantly to the output prediction. They help identify which features of the input image are important for making accurate predictions.

Metrics calculation involves computing quantitative measures such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., to assess the overall performance of the model. These metrics provide insights into how well the model generalizes to unseen data and can aid in identifying areas for improvement.

A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification model by comparing predicted labels against actual labels. It provides detailed information about true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of the model's strengths and weaknesses.

In the given context, it appears that the authors did not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps after model training. However, they likely employed some form of evaluation technique to validate their approach and measure its effectiveness. Based on the description of their methodology, one could infer that they might have calculated metrics such as accuracy or F1 score to compare the performance of different models or configurations. Additionally, they may have utilized tools like saliency maps or confusion matrices to gain further insight into the behavior of their model during training and testing phases.
