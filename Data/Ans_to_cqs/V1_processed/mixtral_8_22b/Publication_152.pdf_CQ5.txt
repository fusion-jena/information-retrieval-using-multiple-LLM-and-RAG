The given context does not provide explicit information about specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that image data of Hedychium Coronarium was collected for training the U-Net model and a DJI Phantom 2 drone with a Global Positioning System (GPS) was utilized for this purpose. Additionally, the text discusses using RGB images captured by a UAV as input for training the network. Therefore, based on the available context, we can infer that custom datasets consisting of RGB images were created and employed in the deep learning pipeline rather than commonly known benchmark datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
