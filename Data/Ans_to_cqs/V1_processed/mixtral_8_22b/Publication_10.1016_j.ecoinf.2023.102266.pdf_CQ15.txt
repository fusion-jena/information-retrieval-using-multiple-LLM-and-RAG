The text does not provide explicit information about specific optimization techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that they plan to modify their update criterion to maintain stochasticity but make it differentiable. This modification allows them to leverage machine learning tools and transform their model into an intelligent cellular automaton. Additionally, they discuss optimizing the scope by changing partitions to expose more cells in each iteration, creating another adjustable parameter to enhance the model's accuracy and efficiency. These modifications suggest that some form of optimization technique might be employed, although the exact methods remain unspecified in the provided context.
