Training completion is determined by several criteria, depending on the model and optimization algorithm being used. One common criterion is reaching a validation loss plateau, where further training no longer significantly improves the model's performance on the validation set. This can indicate that the model has learned as much as it can from the data without overfitting. Another criterion could be setting a maximum number of epochs, such as the mentioned 10 epochs in this case, after which training will stop regardless of whether the validation loss has plateaued or not. Additionally, early stopping can be employed, where training stops if the validation loss starts increasing instead of decreasing, indicating potential overfitting. However, the exact criteria may vary between different applications and models.
