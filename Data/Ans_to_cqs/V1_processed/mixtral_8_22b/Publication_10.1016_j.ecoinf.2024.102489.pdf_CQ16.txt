The study uses a grid search method (GridSearchCV) based on the out-of-bag (OOB) error and five-fold cross-validation to search for the optimal parameters of the Random Forest (RF) model. The parameters include the number of trees (n\_estimators), minimum number of leaves (minleaf), and number of randomly selected node-split feature variables (max\_features). The n\_estimators are spaced at 50 intervals, ranging from 100 to 1000. The minleaf is set to 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50. The max\_features are spaced at intervals of 1, ranging from 1 to k where k is the number of characteristic variables. However, the text does not explicitly mention any specific criteria for determining when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau or other stopping conditions.
