Based on the given context, it appears that remote sensing (RS) data is primarily used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, monthly averages of five Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor vertical column density (VCD) products are mentioned, including measurements of SO2, NO2, O3, HCHO, and CO. These measurements provide information about various pollutants in the atmosphere, which can be useful for training machine learning algorithms to predict air quality. Additionally, some studies may use self-made passive samplers to collect data on specific pollutants, such as those found in Budapest (Neckel et al., 2023). However, the context does not explicitly mention other methods such as surveys or public datasets being used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
