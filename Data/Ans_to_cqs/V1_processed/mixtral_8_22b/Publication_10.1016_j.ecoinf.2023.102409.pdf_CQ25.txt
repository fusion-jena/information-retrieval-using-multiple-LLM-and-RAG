The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the given context is primarily for semantic segmentation tasks. Semantic segmentation is a process where each pixel in an image is classified according to its class or category. For instance, in the case of DeepLabv3+, the model uses MobileNetv2 as its backbone network and incorporates the Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) module to improve the performance of the model in handling multi-scale objects. Similarly, the U-Net model also performs semantic segmentation tasks but utilizes an encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections between them. Both these models aim to achieve high accuracy while maintaining their lightweight nature, making them suitable for various applications such as remote sensing image analysis, medical imaging, etc.
