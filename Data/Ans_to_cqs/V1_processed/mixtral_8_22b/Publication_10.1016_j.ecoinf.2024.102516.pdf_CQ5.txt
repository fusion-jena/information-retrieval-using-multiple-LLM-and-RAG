The paper mentions two datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The first one is a dedicated plant cover data, which is likely a custom dataset created specifically for this study. This dataset contains images of various plant species and is used to train and evaluate the proposed method. The second dataset mentioned is the ImageNet classification dataset, which is a well-known benchmark dataset containing millions of labeled images belonging to thousands of categories. In this case, the authors use a pre-trained ResNet50 model that has been trained on ImageNet to serve as a baseline comparison for their proposed method. However, since ImageNet does not contain the specific plant species present in the dedicated plant cover data, the pre-trained model needs to be fine-tuned on the custom dataset before being evaluated.
