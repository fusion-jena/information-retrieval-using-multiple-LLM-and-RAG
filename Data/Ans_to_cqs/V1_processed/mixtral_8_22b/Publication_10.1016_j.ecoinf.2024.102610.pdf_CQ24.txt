The provided context does not directly address the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it discusses methods used to prevent potential performance degradation and overfitting in a classical random forest machine learning model applied to predict relative tsetse abundance in Kenya. Two common variable elimination techniques were employed: Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Variable Selection Using Random Forests (VSURF). These techniques help improve the model's performance and generalization capabilities by removing irrelevant or redundant features from the dataset. While these methods do not specifically target handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, they contribute to building more robust and reliable machine learning models.
