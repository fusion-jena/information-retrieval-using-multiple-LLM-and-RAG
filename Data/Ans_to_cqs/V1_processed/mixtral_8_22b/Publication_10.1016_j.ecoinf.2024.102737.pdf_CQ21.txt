The information provided does not explicitly mention any postprocessing steps involved after the model training such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices. However, based on the context, it appears that the authors evaluated their models using precision measures (P1, P3, P5, P6), which suggests that they calculated metrics to evaluate their models. Additionally, they may have also created confusion matrices to visualize the performance of their models. Unfortunately, without more explicit information about the postprocessing steps, it cannot be confirmed what other steps were taken beyond calculating precision measures and potentially creating confusion matrices.
