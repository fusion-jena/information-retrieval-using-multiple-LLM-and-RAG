The text does not provide explicit information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, based on common practices in machine learning and deep learning, several techniques can be employed to mitigate data bias. These include stratified splitting, where the dataset is divided into training and testing sets while maintaining the original class distribution; oversampling, which involves duplicating minority class examples to balance the dataset; undersampling, where majority class examples are removed to achieve balance; and diverse data collection, which focuses on gathering more representative and varied data. It should be noted that these techniques are not mentioned explicitly in the given context, but they are widely used in addressing data bias issues.
