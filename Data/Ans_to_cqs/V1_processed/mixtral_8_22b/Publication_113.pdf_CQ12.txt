The pipeline described uses a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) as its embedding model. This is evident from the mention of deep neural networks being used for dimensionality reduction, where the input to a deep network often has many values, but layers typically get smaller throughout the network. Additionally, the text mentions that deep convolutional neural networks are designed specifically to process images, and that recent work has demonstrated their effectiveness. Furthermore, the pipeline involves resizing cropped images to 256 x 256 pixels, which is a common practice when working with CNNs.
