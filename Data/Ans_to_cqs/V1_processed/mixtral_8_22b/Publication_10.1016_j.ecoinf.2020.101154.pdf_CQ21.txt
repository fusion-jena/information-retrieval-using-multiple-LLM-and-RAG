Based on the given context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices. However, it can be inferred that some form of evaluation was conducted based on the mention of using Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate the performance of the RY models. Additionally, the use of early stopping to prevent overfitting suggests that some form of validation was employed during the training process. It is also mentioned that hyperparameter tuning was done manually, indicating that some form of optimization was carried out. Nevertheless, without more specific details regarding the postprocessing steps, it cannot be definitively stated what these steps entailed.
