The given context does not directly mention any specific evaluation metrics used for assessing the performance of the deep learning model. However, common metrics used to evaluate deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, and Area Under Curve (AUC). These metrics help measure how well the model is performing on unseen data and can be chosen based on the problem statement and dataset characteristics. For instance, if the task involves imbalanced classes, then precision, recall, and F1 scores might be more suitable than accuracy alone.

In the context of remote sensing applications like coastal bathymetry estimation, some commonly used evaluation metrics could include Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), coefficient of determination (R^2), and correlation coefficients between predicted and actual values. These metrics would help quantify the error and agreement between the estimated bathymetric maps generated by the deep learning model and the ground truth measurements.
