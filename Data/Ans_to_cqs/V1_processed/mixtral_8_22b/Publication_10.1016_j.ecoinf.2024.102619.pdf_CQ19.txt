The deep learning model is built using accessible platforms/frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow. Specifically, PyTorch is used as the machine learning framework for deep learning, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Additionally, skorch, a scikit-learn compatible neural network library that wraps PyTorch, is employed to ensure comparable model training and analysis pipelines. Therefore, the frameworks used to build the deep learning model are PyTorch and TensorFlow, with PyTorch being the primary one utilized.
