The given context does not provide any direct reference to the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the paper. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact code repository link based on this information alone. It would be necessary to refer to additional sources such as the authors' personal websites, research group pages, or academic publications to find the relevant code repository links.
