Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention that the initial value of the weight Î»m is set to 1, but after 10 training iterations, its relative value is adjusted based on the reciprocal of the set value. This suggests that the number of training iterations could be one criterion used to adjust certain parameters during the training process. In general, common criteria used to determine when training is complete include reaching a predefined number of epochs or iterations, achieving a desired level of performance on a validation dataset, observing a plateau or decrease in the validation loss, or meeting other specified conditions. Without additional context, it cannot be definitively stated what criteria were used in this particular case.
