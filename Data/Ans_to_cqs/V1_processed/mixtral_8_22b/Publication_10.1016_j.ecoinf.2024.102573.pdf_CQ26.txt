Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection being employed to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some relevant information regarding data processing and handling can be found.

In the context, we see that LEAF (Learnable Audio Frontend) is introduced as a more flexible approach compared to traditional static audio frontends like spectrograms. This flexibility allows LEAF to adapt to the characteristics of the dataset. One way LEAF achieves this adaptation is by employing learnable Gaussian pooling instead of mean or max pooling. This learnable pooling uses Gaussian kernels with adjustable spreads for each frequency band, which helps tailor the model to the unique features of the dataset.

Additionally, LEAF utilizes learnable PCEN (Power Compressed Exponential Normalization), which serves as both a compression and normalization method. By applying these techniques, LEAF aims to reduce the impact of stationary background noise and improve overall performance.

While these approaches do not directly correspond to the mentioned techniques for addressing data bias, they demonstrate efforts towards customizing the model to suit the dataset's properties and mitigate potential issues arising from noisy or biased data.
