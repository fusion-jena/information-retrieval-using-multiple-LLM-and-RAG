The provided context does not mention which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning models. However, it mentions that the implementation of the classification methods was carried out in Python using the libraries TensorFlow and Scikit-learn. This suggests that the deployment might have been done locally or on any cloud platform compatible with these libraries. Unfortunately, without further information, I cannot determine the exact platform used for deployment.
