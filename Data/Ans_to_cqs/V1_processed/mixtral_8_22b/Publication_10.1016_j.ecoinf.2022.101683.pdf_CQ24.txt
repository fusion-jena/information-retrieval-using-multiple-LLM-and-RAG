The context does not provide information on handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or any specific mention of random seeds. However, there are several common strategies employed to manage randomness in deep learning pipelines. These include fixing the random seed value, which ensures reproducibility by generating the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers across multiple runs. Another strategy involves performing multiple runs with different random seeds and averaging the results to mitigate the impact of individual random initializations. Additionally, techniques such as cross-validation and bootstrapping can help assess the robustness of models against variations due to randomness. Lastly, employing deterministic algorithms instead of stochastic ones can also eliminate sources of randomness in certain parts of the pipeline.
