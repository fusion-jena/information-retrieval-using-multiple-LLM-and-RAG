Based on the given information, there is no direct mention or explanation of how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, such as through methods like grid search or random search. However, it can be inferred from Table 1 that the XGBoost method was employed for class delineation, which suggests that some form of parameter tuning might have been performed during the implementation of the XGBoost algorithm. Unfortunately, without explicit details regarding the specific hyperparameter optimization techniques applied, we cannot provide a definitive response to this query.
