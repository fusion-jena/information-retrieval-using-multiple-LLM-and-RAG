The given context does not provide information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training such as train, test, and validation sets. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact criteria based solely on this context. However, typically, data is randomly divided into three subsets: training set, validation set, and testing set. The training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Finally, the testing set is used to evaluate the final performance of the trained model.
