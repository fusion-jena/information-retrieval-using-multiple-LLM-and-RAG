Based on the given context, it appears that the primary focus is on visual recognition tasks, specifically face recognition and elephant identification. This suggests that the main data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images. However, the context does not explicitly mention other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV files. Therefore, while we cannot definitively rule out the possibility of those formats being used elsewhere in the pipeline, the information provided indicates that images are the predominant data format utilized in this case.
