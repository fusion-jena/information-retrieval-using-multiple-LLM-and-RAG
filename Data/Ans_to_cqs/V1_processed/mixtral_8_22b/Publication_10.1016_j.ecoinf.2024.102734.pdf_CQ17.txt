The text does not provide explicit information about the use of specific regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of various strategies to improve model performance and generalizability. These include data augmentation, transfer learning, and active learning. Data augmentation can help reduce overfitting by increasing the diversity of the training data. Transfer learning leverages knowledge gained from solving one problem to solve another related problem, often reducing the need for large amounts of labeled data. Active learning involves selecting the most informative samples for labeling, which can lead to better model performance with fewer labeled examples. While these techniques do not directly address overfitting through regularization methods, they contribute to improving model robustness and preventing overfitting indirectly.
