The given context does not provide explicit information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge, some common techniques used to mitigate data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets or strata, ensuring each subset maintains the original distribution of classes or labels. This technique helps maintain balance among different categories within the dataset.

Oversampling is a method where additional copies of minority class examples are added to the dataset to achieve better balance. Conversely, undersampling reduces the majority class by randomly removing instances from it until the desired balance is achieved. Both methods aim to create a balanced dataset, which can improve the performance of machine learning models.

Lastly, diverse data collection focuses on gathering data from various sources, environments, and conditions to ensure the dataset represents real-world scenarios accurately. This approach can help reduce biases introduced due to limited or skewed data representation.

While these techniques are commonly employed to tackle data bias, the given context does not explicitly mention their use in this particular study.
