Unfortunately, there is no explicit mention or reference to any specific data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF where the deep learning pipeline data is available in the given context. It would be best to refer back to the primary source material or contact the authors for further clarification regarding the availability of their data repository.

Based on the provided context, it appears that the researchers have developed a novel deep learning method called the ESK model, which combines Elastic Net-Stacked Autoencoder (EN-SAE) with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). This model aims to classify fish from different families using DNA barcode sequences. However, the exact sources of the DNA barcode sequences used in this research are not mentioned explicitly within the provided context.

In summary, without additional information, it cannot be determined where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. Further investigation into the primary source materials or direct communication with the authors may provide the necessary details.
