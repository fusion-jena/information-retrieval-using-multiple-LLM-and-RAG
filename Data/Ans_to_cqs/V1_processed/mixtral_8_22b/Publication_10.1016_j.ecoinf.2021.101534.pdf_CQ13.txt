In the given context, there is no explicit mention of the specific hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model. However, we can infer some details about the model training process from the information provided.

The model used is YOLOv5s, the smallest weight of YOLOv5, which is built for sound identification. It was trained for 100 epochs with a batch size of 32 and an input image dimension of 640 x 640. Default data augmentation techniques like scaling, color space adjustments, and Mosaic augmentation were applied during the training process. Four original spectrograms were randomly selected, resized, cropped, color jittered, and merged into one large input image for model training.

While the exact values of the learning rate and optimizer are not mentioned, these are common hyperparameters that would have been set during the model training process. Additionally, other parameters like regularization methods, dropout rates, or early stopping criteria might also have been employed but are not explicitly stated in the provided context.
