The paper does not explicitly mention the format of the input data used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that the data was collected from online sources, specifically social media posts and web articles. This suggests that the data used in the pipeline is likely to be in text format rather than images, audio, or videos. Furthermore, the authors discuss the challenges of dealing with large volumes of highly variable textual data, further supporting the idea that the data used in the pipeline is primarily text-based. Therefore, based on the information available in the given context, it can be concluded that the data used in the deep learning pipeline is most likely in text format.
