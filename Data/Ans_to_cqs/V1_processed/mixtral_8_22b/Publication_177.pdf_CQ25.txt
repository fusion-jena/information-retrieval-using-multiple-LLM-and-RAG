The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the given context is for image classification tasks. These models are trained and fine-tuned to recognize and categorize various plant species based on their visual features. Specifically, they aim to distinguish between different types of plants and assign them to their respective classes or categories. This is evident from the use of terms like 'class','species', and 'taxonomic' throughout the text, which all pertain to the identification and organization of organisms into distinct groups. Furthermore, the performance metrics presented in Tables I and II, such as sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1-score, are commonly used to evaluate the effectiveness of classification models.
