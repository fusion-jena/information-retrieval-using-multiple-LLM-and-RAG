Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of the data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that the dataset used is publicly available in Roboflow named Animal2-v1. Therefore, one can assume that the data repository link might be related to this dataset. Unfortunately, without more specific details or direct links, I cannot provide the exact data repository link for the deep learning pipeline.
