The given context does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in any deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact values or types of hyperparameters employed in this case. However, some common hyperparameters used in deep learning models include learning rate, optimizer type (such as Adam, Stochastic Gradient Descent, etc.), batch size, number of epochs, weight decay, and others depending on the specific architecture and problem being addressed.
