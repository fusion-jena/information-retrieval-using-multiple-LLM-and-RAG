Based on the given context, it appears that the authors utilize publicly available datasets for their deep learning pipeline. Specifically, they mention using the Xeno-Canto website to collect data on 14 species of birds. However, there is no explicit information regarding the use of surveys or sensors for data collection. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, we can only infer that one method used for gathering raw data is accessing publicly available datasets such as those found on websites like Xeno-Canto.
