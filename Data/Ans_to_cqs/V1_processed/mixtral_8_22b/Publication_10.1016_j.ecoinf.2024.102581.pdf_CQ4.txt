The data augmentation techniques applied during the learning phase of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) include random rotation, random cropping, random flipping, random color jittering, and random noise addition. These techniques ensure that a wide range of possible cases are considered, which helps improve the model's performance when dealing with real-world scenarios.

Random rotation involves rotating images by a certain angle, while random cropping entails selecting a portion of the original image randomly. Random flipping refers to horizontally or vertically flipping the input images. Random color jittering modifies the brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue of the input images, whereas random noise addition introduces Gaussian or salt-and-pepper noise into the images. All these techniques help increase the diversity of training samples, making the model more robust and generalizable.
