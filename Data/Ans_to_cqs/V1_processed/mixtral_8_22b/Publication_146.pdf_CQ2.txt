In this deep learning pipeline, the data format used is primarily images. Specifically, the initial objects are outlined as vectors in the given Sentinel-1 images. These images are then converted into the darknet annotation format with text files containing information on the label class of objects and positions in the image. The Sentinel-1 images are further cropped into image tiles in the sizes of 640 x 640 pixels. This results in a total of 1609 images with corresponding label files. Therefore, it can be concluded that the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is images.
