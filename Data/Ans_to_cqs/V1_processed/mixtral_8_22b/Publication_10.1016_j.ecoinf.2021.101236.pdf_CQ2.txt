The deep learning pipeline primarily uses audio data. This is evident from the statement "acquisition of large amounts of audio data" in section 2. However, it's important to note that the audio data is converted into visual representations, specifically single-channel mel spectrograms of size 64 x 384. These spectrograms can be considered as monochrome images, as mentioned in section 2.5. Therefore, while the initial data format is audio, it is transformed into a visual representation for further processing in the deep learning pipeline.
