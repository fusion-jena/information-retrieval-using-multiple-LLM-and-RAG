The postprocessing steps involved after the model training include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., and creating confusion matrices. Saliency maps help identify which parts of the input image were important for the model's decision making. Calculating metrics helps evaluate the performance of the model. Creating confusion matrices provides insights into the types of errors made by the model.

Based on the given context, the authors have used various techniques for postprocessing their trained models. They have generated saliency maps using Guided Backpropagation (Springenberg et al., 2015) and Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (Bach et al., 2015) methods. They have also calculated various metrics such as train, validation, and test accuracies with raw and pre-processed datasets. Additionally, they have created confusion matrices for the VGG-19 architecture. However, there is no mention of other specific postprocessing steps such as feature visualization or error analysis.
