From the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of handling randomness specifically related to the deep learning pipeline or random seed values. However, some strategies can be inferred based on the information available.

One strategy mentioned to prevent overfitting, which could be considered a form of managing randomness, is early stopping. Early stopping involves monitoring the model's performance on a separate validation dataset during training and halting the training process once the model starts to overfit the data. This helps ensure that the model does not become excessively specialized to the training data, leading to poor generalization on new data.

Additionally, the context mentions splitting the dataset into two parts: 80% for training and 20% for testing. By separating these datasets, the model can be trained on one portion while being evaluated on another, providing a more accurate assessment of its ability to generalize to new data.

Furthermore, the text discusses selecting the appropriate number of neurons and learning rate through a trial-and-error method. This iterative process allows for experimentation with different configurations to find the optimal combination that minimizes the mean squared error between the model output and the measured data. Although not explicitly stated, this approach could also help manage randomness by finding the configuration that performs best across multiple trials.

Lastly, the context describes using a final ANN structure with five input variables, one node for bias, 19 hidden neurons with one node for bias, a learning rate of 0.7, and one output variable. This specific architecture may have been chosen after evaluating various configurations, further demonstrating the use of systematic methods to address potential sources of randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
