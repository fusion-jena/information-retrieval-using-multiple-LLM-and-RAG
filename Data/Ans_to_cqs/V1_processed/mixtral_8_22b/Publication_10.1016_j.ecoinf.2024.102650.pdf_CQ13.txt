The given context does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. However, it mentions that the Enhanced Representation through Knowledge Integration (ERNIE) model was used, which is known to learn prior semantic relationships and word order features from massive amounts of data. This suggests that the model may have been trained using techniques like transfer learning or fine-tuning, but without further details, we cannot determine the exact hyperparameters used.
