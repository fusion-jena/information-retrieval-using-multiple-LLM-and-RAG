The text does not provide explicit information about specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it mentions that a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) was used for covey call detection, which was trained on covey call spectrogram data collected separately from various locations in Georgia and Alabama, USA. This suggests that the dataset used for training the CNN consisted of labeled audio recordings of covey calls. Additionally, the text refers to other published models like BirdNET and BirdCLEF, but it doesn't specify the exact datasets used for those models either.
