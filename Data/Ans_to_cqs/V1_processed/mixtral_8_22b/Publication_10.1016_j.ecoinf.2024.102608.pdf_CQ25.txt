The text does not explicitly state the specific purpose or type of the artificial neural network (ANN) used in this study. However, it mentions that ANNs have been employed in various applications, including speech recognition, image recognition, natural language processing, and freshwater ecology. Given that the study focuses on water quality parameters like chlorophyll-a, Secchi depth, and total suspended solids, it can be inferred that the ANN might be used for regression tasks related to predicting these parameters based on remote sensing data from Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat-8 OLI satellites. Nevertheless, without explicit information about the architecture and objective function of the ANN, we cannot definitively determine its exact purpose within the scope of classification, segmentation, or detection tasks.
