The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, based on the information provided, one can infer that the model is designed for classification tasks. This is evident from the mention of the sigmoid activation function used in the output layer, which is typically employed for binary or multi-class classification problems. Furthermore, the text mentions obtaining accuracy, true positive rate, and false positive rate, metrics often used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. Additionally, the model uses LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), a type of recurrent neural network architecture particularly useful for sequence prediction problems, suggesting that the model might be applied to time series data for classification purposes.
