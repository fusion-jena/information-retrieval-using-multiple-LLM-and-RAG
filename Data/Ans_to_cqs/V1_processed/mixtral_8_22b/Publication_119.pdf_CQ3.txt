In the given context, there isn't explicit mention of specific data annotation techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, we do see references to the use of deep learning models, specifically the U-Net model, for semantic segmentation tasks. Semantic segmentation involves assigning a class label to every pixel in an image, essentially creating a dense prediction map. This task requires pixel-level annotations, where each pixel in the training images is labeled according to its corresponding object or region category.

While not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that the authors might have employed pixel-wise annotation methods to create their training datasets. These methods involve manually outlining objects or regions in the images and assigning them appropriate labels. Since the U-Net model is being used for semantic segmentation, it would require such detailed annotated data to learn effectively.

Additionally, the text mentions the need for abundant data for training deep neural networks, suggesting that large amounts of annotated data were required for the study. It also highlights the benefits of using pretrained networks, such as those trained on ImageNet, to reduce the amount of training data needed.

To summarize, although the exact data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline is not specified, based on the information available, it appears that pixel-wise annotation methods may have been utilized for generating the training datasets.
