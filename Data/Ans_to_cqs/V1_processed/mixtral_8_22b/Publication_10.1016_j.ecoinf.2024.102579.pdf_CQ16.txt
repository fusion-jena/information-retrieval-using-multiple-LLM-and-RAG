The given context does not provide information about the completion criteria for training, such as a validation loss plateau. However, generally speaking, common criteria used to determine when training is complete include reaching a minimum threshold for accuracy or performance metrics, observing no significant improvement in validation loss or accuracy over several epochs, or meeting a predefined maximum number of iterations or epochs. These criteria can vary depending on the specific problem, model architecture, and available resources.
