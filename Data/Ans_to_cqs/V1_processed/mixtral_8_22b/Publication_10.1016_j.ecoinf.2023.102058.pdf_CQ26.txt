To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting is a method where the training set is divided into subsets or strata based on specific criteria such as class labels. This ensures that each subset has roughly the same proportion of examples from each target class as the complete set. It helps maintain the overall balance of classes when creating training and validation sets.

Oversampling involves increasing the frequency of minority class instances by duplicating them or generating synthetic examples. This technique aims to balance the class distribution and reduce the impact of imbalanced datasets on the learning algorithm. Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is one commonly used oversampling approach.

Undersampling is another strategy to handle class imbalance by reducing the majority class size. Random undersampling removes random instances from the majority class until it reaches the desired ratio with the minority class. However, this may lead to loss of valuable information. More sophisticated methods like NearMiss and Condensed Nearest Neighbor (CNN) rule focus on removing only those majority class instances that do not contribute much to the classification task.

Diverse data collection refers to gathering a wide range of data samples representing various scenarios, conditions, and environments. This practice promotes fairness and reduces biases in the trained models by exposing them to more comprehensive and realistic situations.

These techniques help mitigate data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, ensuring improved model performance and generalization capabilities.
