The table presents classification accuracies of various methods utilizing multi-textural features with an optimal window. The overall accuracy (OA) and kappa index are used to measure the performance of these methods. The OA represents the aggregate classification accuracy, while the kappa index measures the agreement between predicted and observed categories. There is a positive correlation between the OA and kappa index. In this study, four different classifiers were employed: Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Random Forest (RF). Each method was evaluated based on its ability to accurately classify spectral data combined with textural features such as mean and entropy. The results show that the highest overall accuracy was achieved by the SVM method when combining all three features (spectral, mean, and entropy). However, it should be noted that the choice of evaluation metric depends on the specific requirements and goals of the study. Other commonly used metrics include precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the curve (AUC). These metrics can provide additional insights into the performance of the model beyond simple accuracy measurements.
