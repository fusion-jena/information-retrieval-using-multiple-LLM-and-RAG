The text does not provide specific information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model used in this study. However, it mentions that bias-variance decomposition was employed to evaluate the model's generalizability to unseen datasets. This method helps determine whether the model has high or low bias and variance, which can indicate if the model is underfitting or overfitting the data.

While the text doesn't explicitly mention using diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, these methods could potentially improve the model's performance and generalizability. Using a diverse dataset ensures that the model learns from different types of examples, reducing the risk of overfitting to one particular type of input. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into multiple subsets and iteratively testing the model on each subset while training on the others. This process provides a more robust estimate of the model's performance and reduces the chance of overfitting. Lastly, stratified splitting maintains the same distribution of target classes across all splits, ensuring that the model sees a representative sample during both training and validation phases.

In summary, although the text does not specify the use of diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, these methods could contribute to improving the deep learning model's generalizability.
