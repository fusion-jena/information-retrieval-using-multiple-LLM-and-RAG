The table titled 'Hyper Parameters and Their Values Used in Training the Proposed Model' provides information about various hyperparameters used in training the proposed model. Among these hyperparameters, several pertain to data augmentation techniques. These include flipping (both flipud and fliplr), translation, scaling, shearing, perspective transformation, mosaic augmentation, mixup, and copy-paste. However, it should be noted that the specific values assigned to these parameters indicate whether or not they have been applied. For instance, flipud and fliplr both have a value of 0.0, suggesting that no vertical or horizontal flipping was performed. On the other hand, translation, scaling, and mosaic augmentation have non-zero values, indicating that these transformations were indeed applied. Specifically, translation was set to 0.1, scaling to 0.5, and mosaic augmentation to 1.0. This implies that images were translated by a small amount, scaled down to half their original size, and combined using the mosaic technique. Other transformations like rotation, hue saturation value adjustment, and degrees were either not applied or not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
