Based on the given context, it appears that there are two subsystems mentioned: LCW-FIS and LCWT-FIS. However, there is no explicit mention of a deep learning model or its specific purpose (classification, segmentation, detection) within these subsystems. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the purpose of any deep learning model in this context.

However, considering the overall topic of predicting future opportunities and threats of land-use changes on beekeeping activities in Turkey, it can be speculated that if a deep learning model were employed, it might be used for tasks such as image classification (to classify land use types), object detection (to identify beehives or other relevant features), or semantic segmentation (to delineate specific regions of interest like forests, agricultural lands, etc.). But without further details about the methodology or techniques used in the study, this remains purely speculative.
