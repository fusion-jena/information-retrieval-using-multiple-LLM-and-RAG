The given context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the data used for training the machine learning models (ANFIS, ANN, and SVM) is likely in a structured format, possibly a CSV file, since the parameters listed include various water quality measurements with their respective units. These types of data are typically stored in tabular form, making them suitable for use in machine learning algorithms. It should be noted that without explicit confirmation, this remains an educated guess based on the context provided.
