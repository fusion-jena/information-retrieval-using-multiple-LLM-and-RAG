Based on the given context, no specific strategy is mentioned to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some common practices can be suggested based on standard machine learning techniques. These include setting a fixed random seed value before running experiments to ensure reproducibility, using cross-validation techniques to reduce overfitting due to random splits, and employing multiple runs with different seeds to assess the stability and robustness of the results. Additionally, advanced techniques like Bayesian optimization can also be utilized to optimize hyperparameters while accounting for uncertainty caused by randomness.
