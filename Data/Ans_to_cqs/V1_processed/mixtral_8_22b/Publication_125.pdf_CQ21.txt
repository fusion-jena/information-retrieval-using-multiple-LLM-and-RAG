After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements or goals of the analysis. Some common postprocessing steps include:

1. Evaluation metrics: Calculating various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves, etc., to evaluate the performance of the model. In the given context, Figures 7 and 8 show the training and validation accuracies of the model over plain and encrypted data respectively.

2. Confusion Matrix: Creating a confusion matrix to visualize the performance of the classification model. It shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions made by the model for each class.

3. Saliency Maps: Generating saliency maps to understand which parts of the input image were most important for the model's decision making. These maps highlight the regions of the input image that had the highest impact on the final prediction.

4. Visualization of Results: Visualizing the output of the model on test data to gain insights into its performance. For example, plotting predicted vs actual labels, or generating heatmaps to visualize the spatial distribution of predictions.

In the given context, it appears that the authors did not explicitly mention any postprocessing steps beyond evaluating the model's accuracy. However, based on standard practices in machine learning, one could infer that they likely calculated additional evaluation metrics and possibly generated some form of visualizations to better understand their model's performance.
