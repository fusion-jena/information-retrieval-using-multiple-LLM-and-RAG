The text does not provide specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the authors used TensorFlow, an open-source software platform, to train a deep learning algorithm based on 405 images for Mexican triatomine species and 1,584 images for Brazilian triatomine species. This suggests that image labeling or categorization might be one of the data annotation techniques used in their study. Unfortunately, without further details, it cannot be confirmed if they also utilized additional techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.
