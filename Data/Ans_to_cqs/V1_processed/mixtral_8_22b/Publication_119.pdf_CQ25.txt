The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, based on the information provided, it appears that the model is being used for multi-class classification. This is suggested by the mention of the output layer containing 11 neurons, which corresponds to the number of classes to be classified. Additionally, the use of the cross-entropy loss function also indicates that the model is likely being used for classification tasks. Therefore, we can infer that the purpose of the deep learning model is to classify input data into one of several possible categories or classes.
