The text does not provide explicit information on the specific post-processing steps involved after the model training. However, based on common practices in machine learning, some potential post-processing steps could include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics such as accuracy or F1 score, creating confusion matrices, and visualizing results using tools like TensorBoard. These techniques help evaluate the performance of the trained model and identify areas for improvement. It is important to note that the actual post-processing steps may vary depending on the specific requirements and goals of the project.
