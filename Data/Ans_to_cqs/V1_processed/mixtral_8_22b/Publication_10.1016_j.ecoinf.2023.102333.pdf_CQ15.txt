The text mentions several optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. One of these techniques is stochastic gradient descent (SGD), which has been shown to be effective for DNN training but can sometimes get stuck in local minima. To overcome this issue, momentum is often added to SGD to accelerate its convergence. Another technique mentioned is Dropout regularization, which helps prevent overfitting by randomly dropping out neurons during training. Additionally, the use of exponential linear unit (ELU) activation functions has gained popularity for addressing limitations of other activation functions like ReLU. While specific optimization algorithms like SGD or Adam are not explicitly named in the given context, the mention of hyperparameters such as learning rate suggests that one of these algorithms may have been used.
