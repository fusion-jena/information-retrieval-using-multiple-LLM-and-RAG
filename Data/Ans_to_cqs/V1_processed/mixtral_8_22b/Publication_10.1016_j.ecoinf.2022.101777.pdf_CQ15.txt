Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), or others being applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of Random Forest (RF), which is a type of ensemble learning method rather than an optimization technique. Therefore, without additional information, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the application of optimization techniques like SGD or Adam in this particular case.
