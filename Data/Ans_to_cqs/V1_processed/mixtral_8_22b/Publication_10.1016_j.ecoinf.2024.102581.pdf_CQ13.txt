The study uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for plant leaf image classification. The search space of CNN hyperparameters includes convolution layers, filters, filter size, number of neurons, batch size, epochs, and CNN model optimizers. The range of values considered for these hyperparameters is listed below:

- Convolution Layers: Lower limit = 1 and Upper limit = 10
- Filters: Lower limit = 1 and Upper limit = 64
- Filter Size: Lower limit = 1 and Upper limit = 10
- Number of Neuron: Lower limit = 32 and Upper limit = 1024
- Batch Size: Lower limit = 8 and Upper limit = 512
- Epochs: Lower limit = 1 and Upper limit = 25
- CNN Model Optimizer: ADAM, SGD, RMSProp, Adadelta, Adagrad, Adamax

These hyperparameters are tuned using a hybrid nature-inspired algorithm called HPB3C-3PGA. The proposed approach aims to find the best combination of hyperparameters that result in the highest accuracy for plant leaf image classification. After completing the iterations, the proposed approach provides us with the best hyperparameters, thus evolving the near-optimal CNN.
