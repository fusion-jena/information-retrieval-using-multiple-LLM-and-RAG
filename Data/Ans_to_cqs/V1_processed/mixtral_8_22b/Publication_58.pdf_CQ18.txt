During the training process, the model performance was monitored through a specific strategy involving splitting the dataset into three distinct parts: a learning set, a validation set, and a test set. Four out of five areas were utilized for learning and validation purposes, while the remaining isolated scene served as the independent test set. This test set encompassed all classes for both nomenclatures, including the five Land Cover (LC) classes and twelve Land Use (LU) classes. Additionally, this image represented various environments characteristic of the New Caledonian landscape, such as urban, mining, mountainous, and forest environments, spanning from coastal regions to inland mountain areas.

To evaluate the final performance of the models, a confusion matrix and quality metrics were calculated using the entire test scene. Furthermore, all architectures were trained using stochastic gradient descent with a consistent protocol, employing a momentum of 0.9 and initiating with an initial learning rate of 10^-2. After every 20 epochs, the learning rate was reduced by dividing it by 10 until it reached 10^-6.
