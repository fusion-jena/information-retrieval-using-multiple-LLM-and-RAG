The text does not provide explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the FAP-VTI service accepts user-provided vessel tracking data in CSV format, suggesting that one possible source of raw data could be user-generated or collected data. Additionally, the FAP-GFW service uses daily vessel tracking data between 2012 and 2016 from the Global Fishing Watch, indicating that another potential source of raw data could be publicly available datasets like those provided by organizations such as Global Fishing Watch. Without further context, it cannot be definitively stated what specific methods are being employed for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
