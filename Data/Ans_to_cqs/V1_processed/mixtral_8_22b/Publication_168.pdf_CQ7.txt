According to the given context, the criterion used to split the data for deep learning model training is not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred from the statement "Considering it is hard to label hyperspectral image in the real world, we split the labeled pixels of UAV hyperspectral image into the training set and test set with the ratio 1:9." This suggests that the labeled pixels of the UAV hyperspectral image were divided into two sets - a training set and a test set, with a ratio of 1:9 respectively. It means that out of all the available labeled pixels, only 1/10th of them were used for training the deep learning model, while the remaining 9/10th of them were used for testing its performance. No mention was made about using a separate validation set. Therefore, it appears that the authors did not use any specific criteria or methodology to determine the optimal size of the training and test sets, but rather chose a fixed ratio based on their judgment.
