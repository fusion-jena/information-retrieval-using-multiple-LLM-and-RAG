The study utilizes two main methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline: citizen science and deep learning methods. Citizen science involves using the online platform Zooniverse to collect multiple non-expert counts by citizen scientists. These counts are then filtered and aggregated into a single count for each survey image. On the other hand, the deep learning method employs a bespoke deep learning technique through the use of a convolutional neural network. Raw count data from both methods are made publicly available on Enlighten: Research Data and source code is accessible from Zenodo. It is worth noting that the greatest challenge for implementing these algorithms for bespoke applications is obtaining sufficiently large training datasets. However, citizen scientists have a clear role to play in addressing this challenge.
