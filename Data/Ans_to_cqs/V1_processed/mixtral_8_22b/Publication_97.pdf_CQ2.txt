Based on the given context, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images. Specifically, the training data were generated as batches of size (m, 256, 256, 3), which indicates that the input data consists of three channels, likely representing red, green, and blue color channels. Additionally, the context mentions that the batches consisted of sub-images of size 256 x 256 that were randomly cropped out from the original satellite images. Furthermore, the corresponding batches of mask data had shape (20, 256, 256, 1), indicating that the output data also consists of single-channel images. Therefore, the deep learning pipeline uses image data as its input and output format.
