The context does not provide information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. Typically, machine learning models use various metrics like validation loss, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., to evaluate model performance during training. A common criterion for stopping training is when the validation loss plateaus, indicating that the model has learned as much as it can from the training data without overfitting. However, since the context does not explicitly mention these details, I cannot provide a definitive answer.
