The text does not provide specific details about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the selected deep learning architecture, HerdNet, was chosen based on its performance in a previous SRF-OCC study. This suggests that the dataset used might be related to wildlife or animal detection in aerial imagery. Unfortunately, without more specific information, we cannot determine if well-known datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet were utilized.
