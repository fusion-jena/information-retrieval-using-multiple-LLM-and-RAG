The text does not provide explicit information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. However, it mentions that conducting large cross-validation experiments with deep learning-based models is often infeasible due to their high computational costs. This suggests that the authors likely utilized some form of advanced computing resources, possibly including GPUs or TPUs, to train their deep learning models efficiently.
