In this study, the researchers developed a workflow to extract relevant records from social media posts related to red kite sightings. They utilized citizen science data and employed a combination of textual and visual analysis to identify true positive red kite images. Although the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned, some general strategies can be inferred.

Firstly, the use of citizen science data suggests diverse data collection, which helps reduce bias by incorporating information from various sources. Secondly, the workflow enables downsampling of an initially large dataset into a smaller subset, making it feasible to manually analyze the remaining data. This approach can be seen as a form of undersampling, where only a small portion of the original dataset is retained for further processing. Lastly, although not directly addressing data bias, the researchers mention applying image augmentation techniques such as horizontal flipping, shearing, and random zooming to improve the robustness of their models.

However, there is no explicit mention of stratified splitting, oversampling, or any other specific technique aimed at mitigating data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, while the study employs certain strategies that indirectly contribute to reducing data bias, it does not provide detailed insights into the application of well-established techniques like stratified sampling, oversampling, or undersampling.
