The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into sets such as train, test, or validation. However, common practices include splitting the dataset randomly or stratified based on class labels. Typically, datasets are divided into three subsets: training set (used to fit the model), validation set (used to tune hyperparameters during model development), and testing set (used to evaluate the final performance of the trained model). The proportions can vary but often follow ratios like 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. It is essential to ensure that each subset represents the overall distribution of classes in the original dataset.
