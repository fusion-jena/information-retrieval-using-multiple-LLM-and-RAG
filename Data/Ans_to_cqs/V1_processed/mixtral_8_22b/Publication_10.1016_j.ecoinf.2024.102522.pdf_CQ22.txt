The performance of the deep learning models is evaluated using several metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curve, etc. In this case, the authors have used the correct prediction rate or accuracy to measure the performance of their models. For instance, they mention that the correct prediction rate for 'present' was 74.81%, while the prediction accuracy of the model for 'absent' was 76.55%. They also report the overall validation accuracy which was found to be 75.68%. Similarly, for the second model, the correct prediction rates were reported as 76.84% and 77.55% for 'present' and 'absent', respectively, with an overall validation accuracy of 76.17%. Therefore, it can be concluded that the authors have primarily relied on the accuracy metric to assess the effectiveness of their models.
