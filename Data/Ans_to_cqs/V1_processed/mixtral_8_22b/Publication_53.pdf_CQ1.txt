The authors do not explicitly state the method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that the study uses artificial intelligence and remote sensing data to address the critical global information gap regarding the abundance and distribution of farm dams. This suggests that the raw data might have been collected through remote sensing techniques such as satellite imagery or drone footage. Additionally, the study mentions using Python and FastAI for developing the deep learning CNN, indicating that these tools may have been employed for processing and analyzing the raw data. Unfortunately, without further specific details about the exact sources of the raw data, it cannot be definitively stated how the data was initially gathered.
