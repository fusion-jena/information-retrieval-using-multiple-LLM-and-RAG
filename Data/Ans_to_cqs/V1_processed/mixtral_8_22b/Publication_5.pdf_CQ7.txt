Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about how the data was split for deep learning model training (e.g., into train, test, and validation sets). However, it is common practice in machine learning to divide the dataset into three parts: training set, validation set, and test set. Typically, around 60-80% of the data is allocated for training, while the remaining data is divided equally between validation and testing. This division allows for proper evaluation of the model's performance during training and helps avoid overfitting by providing an unbiased estimate of the final model's performance.
