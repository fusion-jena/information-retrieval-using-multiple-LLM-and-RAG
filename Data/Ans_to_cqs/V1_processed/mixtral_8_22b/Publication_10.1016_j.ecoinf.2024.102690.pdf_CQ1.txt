Based on the given information, there isn't any direct mention of specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. However, it can be inferred from the context that some form of data collection has been done to gather information about various aspects like land use types, ecological sources, and service bundles. For instance, the study uses hotspot analysis (Getis-Ord Gi*) to analyze the spatial clustering of ESV and considers hotspot areas with a significance level of 90% or more as optional ecological sources. This suggests that some sort of geospatial data might have been collected and analyzed. Additionally, the identification of ecological sources and setting scenarios seem to rely on certain parameters derived from the collected data. Nevertheless, without explicit details regarding the methodology employed for gathering raw data, one cannot definitively state what methods were used for data collection in this case.
