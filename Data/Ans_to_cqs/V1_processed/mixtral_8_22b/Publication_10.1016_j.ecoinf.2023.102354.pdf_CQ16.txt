The provided context does not discuss any specific criteria for determining when training is complete. However, based on general machine learning principles, some common criteria for determining when training is complete include reaching a minimum validation loss, achieving a maximum accuracy or F1 score, or observing no further improvement in performance metrics over several epochs. These criteria may vary depending on the specific model and dataset being used. In the case of drought analysis, one possible criterion could be achieving a stable and consistent prediction of drought events across multiple timeframes and steps.
