The given context does not provide information about a specific deep learning pipeline or its corresponding data repository link. Therefore, it is impossible to determine the exact data repository link for this hypothetical deep learning pipeline. However, some common repositories used for sharing datasets and code related to machine learning projects include Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, and GBIF. To find the relevant data repository link, one would need more details about the specific deep learning pipeline mentioned in the query.
