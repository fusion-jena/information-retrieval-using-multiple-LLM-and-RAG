In the given context, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly mentioned as either Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer. However, it can be inferred that the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model is utilized in this study. More specifically, the Nonlinear Autoregressive Exogenous Model (NARX) feedforward ANN model is employed to predict vegetation biomass density for 2030. Additionally, a hybrid model is developed by combining wavelet analysis and the NARX ANN algorithm to improve the performance of the NARX ANN model. Therefore, based on the information provided, the deep learning model used in the pipeline is primarily an ANN model, specifically the NARX feedforward ANN model.
