After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements or goals of the analysis. Some common postprocessing steps include:

1. Model Evaluation: This involves calculating various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., to assess the performance of the trained model. These metrics help determine how well the model has learned to distinguish between different classes or categories.

2. Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix is a table layout that allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm. Each row of the matrix represents the instances in an actual class while each column represents the instances in a predicted class.

3. Saliency Maps: These are visualizations that highlight the pixels in the input image which contribute most strongly to the final classification decision made by the model. They provide insights into what parts of the image the model is focusing on when making its predictions.

4. Thresholding: Depending on the problem statement, it might be necessary to apply thresholding to the output probabilities of the model to convert them into binary decisions (e.g., deforestation vs no deforestation).

5. Visualizing Results: This could involve generating prediction maps or other forms of visual representation to better understand the spatial distribution of the predicted outcomes.
