The given context does not provide explicit details about the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, based on general machine learning practices, some common postprocessing steps include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, and creating confusion matrices.

Saliency maps help visualize which parts of the input data were most important for the model's predictions. This can be useful for understanding how the model makes decisions and identifying potential biases or errors.

Calculating metrics involves evaluating the performance of the model using various measures such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc. These metrics help quantify the effectiveness of the model and compare it against other models or baselines.

Creating a confusion matrix provides a summary of the model's predictions versus actual labels. It shows the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives, allowing us to calculate additional metrics like sensitivity, specificity, and ROC curves.

In the given context, there is no mention of these specific postprocessing steps. Instead, the focus seems to be on describing the methodology used for classification and sorting of classes (l1, l2, l3) based on certain criteria (MI & LI). Therefore, without further information, we cannot definitively state what postprocessing steps were taken after model training in this case.
