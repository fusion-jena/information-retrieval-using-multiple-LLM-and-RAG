The paper mentions that the optimizer used for training the custom D-CNN model called CoralNet is Adam. This information can be found in Table 1, where it lists the parameter values used for training CoralNet. In this table, under the 'Optimizer' column, it states that Adam was used as the optimizer. Therefore, we can conclude that Adam is the optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline for this particular study.
