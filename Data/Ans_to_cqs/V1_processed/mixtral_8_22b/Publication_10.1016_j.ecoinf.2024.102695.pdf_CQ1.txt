The given context does not provide explicit information on the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the study involves analyzing multivariate marine chemical data, possibly collected through various means such as sensors or surveys. Furthermore, the mention of Hu et al.'s work on predicting river and stream water quality suggests that they might have employed similar data collection techniques. Similarly, Feng et al.'s use of wavelet threshold denoising implies that their data could have been gathered using sensors or other real-time monitoring devices. Lastly, Ikram et al.'s focus on estimating water temperatures indicates that they may have relied on sensor data or publicly available datasets. In conclusion, while the exact methods for gathering raw data remain undisclosed, it is plausible that the researchers utilized sensors, surveys, or public datasets to collect the necessary information for their respective studies.
