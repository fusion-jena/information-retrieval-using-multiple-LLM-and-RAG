In the field of deep learning, preventing overfitting is crucial to ensure that models generalize well to unseen data. Regularization methods play a significant role in achieving this goal. Two commonly used regularization methods are Dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a technique introduced by Srivastava et al. (2014) to prevent complex co-adaptations between neurons during training. It works by randomly setting a fraction of input units to 0 at each update during training time, which helps to make the training process noisy and more robust. This prevents overfitting by making sure that any one feature cannot dominate the prediction.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of all parameters. By adding this penalty, it encourages smaller parameter values, effectively reducing the complexity of the learned model. This leads to better generalization and reduces the risk of overfitting.

Other regularization methods include early stopping, which stops the training process before convergence when validation error starts increasing; and data augmentation, which artificially increases the size of the dataset by applying transformations like rotation, scaling, or flipping to existing samples.

These regularization methods have been widely adopted in various applications of deep learning, including computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. They help strike a balance between underfitting and overfitting, ensuring that models learn meaningful patterns without memorizing noise or irrelevant features.
