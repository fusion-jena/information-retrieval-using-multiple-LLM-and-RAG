The given context does not provide information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it discusses the use of the covsel R package for automated covariate selection in Species Distribution Models (SDMs). This process involves collinearity filtering algorithms and model-specific embedded regularization techniques. The common inputs mentioned are a numeric vector of species presences and absences, a data frame with continuous covariate data, optional weight vectors, and optional character vectors with the names of covariates to be forced into the final set. However, no specific dataset is explicitly named.
