The text does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, it mentions that each model was trained using a k-fold cross-validation method, where the data was randomly split into 10 equal parts. Each model was then trained on 90% of the data and validated on the remaining 10%. This process was repeated for each tenth of the data. Additionally, a leave-one-out cross-validation method was also employed to evaluate the performance of the models on data collected from different bird colonies or individuals. These methods suggest that the completion of training might be determined based on achieving satisfactory performance metrics such as AUC, PPV, NPV, sensitivity, and specificity during the cross-validation processes.
