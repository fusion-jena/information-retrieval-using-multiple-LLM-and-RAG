Based on the provided context, it appears that the hyperparameters of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model are optimized using a search space exploration method. However, the specific optimization technique used is not explicitly stated in the provided text.

From Table 4, we can see that there are several hyperparameters listed for the CNN model, including the number of convolution layers, filters, filter size, number of neurons, batch size, epochs, and the type of CNN model optimizer. Each of these hyperparameters has a specified range of values to be explored.

It is also mentioned that the proposed approach saves the hyperparameters with the current results until better accuracy is achieved. Additionally, the termination criterion of the proposed approach is the maximum number of iterations to be executed. After completing the iterations, the proposed approach provides us with the best hyperparameters, thus evolving the near-optimal CNN.

While the exact optimization technique used is not clear from the provided context, based on the information available, it seems possible that either a grid search or random search could have been employed to optimize the hyperparameters. Grid search involves systematically exploring every combination of hyperparameter values within a predefined range, while random search randomly samples combinations of hyperparameter values within a defined range. Both techniques aim to identify the optimal combination of hyperparameters that result in the highest performance of the model.

Therefore, without additional context, it cannot be definitively determined which optimization technique was used to optimize the hyperparameters of the CNN model.
