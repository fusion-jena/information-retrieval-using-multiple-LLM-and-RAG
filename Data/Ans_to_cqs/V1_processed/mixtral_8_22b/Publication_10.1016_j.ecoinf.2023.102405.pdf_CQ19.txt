Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention which specific framework was used to build the deep learning model. However, common frameworks used for building deep learning models include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. These frameworks provide tools and libraries to help developers create, train, and deploy machine learning models. Without further information, we cannot determine which framework was utilized in this particular case.
