The given context does not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, based on common practices in machine learning projects, some possible postprocessing steps could include evaluating the performance of the trained models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or area under the ROC curve. Additionally, confusion matrices can be generated to visualize the performance of the classifiers. Other techniques like saliency maps might also be used to understand how the models arrived at their decisions. But these are speculations based on typical ML workflows, as the provided context does not directly address the query.
