In this study, several deep learning architectures were evaluated due to the lack of a priori reasons to favor any particular architecture over another. These included DeepConvLSTM and CNN architectures. Among these, the best validation accuracies were achieved by model 12 in all the years, which has a DeepConvLSTM architecture. Additionally, model 19, also with a DeepConvLSTM architecture, showed high validation accuracies. Lastly, model 14, a CNN architecture, reached a validation accuracy of 0.821 ± 0.005 (mean of years ± sd). Therefore, both DeepConvLSTM and CNN architectures are employed in the pipeline.
