Unfortunately, there is no information available in the given context about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily discusses the use of field-collected data and machine learning methods for developing Above Ground Biomass (AGB) models, as well as the importance of high-quality training samples and sampling point layout for accurate and reliable biomass estimation. Additionally, it mentions the integration of forest inventory data with remote sensing imagery for biomass estimation due to insufficient high-quality training samples. However, without further details regarding the deep learning pipeline, it is not possible to determine which data annotation techniques were utilized.
