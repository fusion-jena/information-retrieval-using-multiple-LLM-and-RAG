Unfortunately, based on the given information, it does not explicitly state where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that they have generated the Agmon annotated dataset but does not provide any details about its availability or location. Therefore, without additional information, it is impossible to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
