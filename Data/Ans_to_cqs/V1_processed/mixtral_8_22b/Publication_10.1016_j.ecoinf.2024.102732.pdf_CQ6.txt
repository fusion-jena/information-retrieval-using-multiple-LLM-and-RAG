Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be applied to improve its performance and efficiency. These may include data cleaning, normalization, scaling, and augmentation. Data cleaning involves removing or correcting any inconsistent, incorrect, or missing data points. Normalization scales numeric columns to a range between 0 and 1, while standardization rescales features so they have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. Both techniques help prevent certain features from dominating others due to their scale. Scaling ensures all input features have similar magnitudes, improving convergence during optimization. Augmentation generates new samples by applying transformations such as rotations, translations, or flips to existing ones, increasing dataset size and diversity. However, not all preprocessing steps are necessary for every problem, and some might even negatively impact performance. Therefore, careful consideration should be given when deciding which preprocessing steps to apply based on the specific requirements and characteristics of the task at hand.
