After the model training, several postprocessing steps can be taken depending on the specific requirements of the project or research. Some common postprocessing steps include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, etc., creating confusion matrices, and performing cross-validation.

In this case, the postprocessing step mentioned is manual visual interpretation approach which was used to correct the image classification results for mangroves within a 10-km buffer zone extending inland from the coastline. This procedure effectively corrected misclassifications between forest and mangroves resulting from'spectral confusion'. Additionally, user's accuracy, total accuracy, and Kappa coefficient were calculated for different years to evaluate the performance of the model.
