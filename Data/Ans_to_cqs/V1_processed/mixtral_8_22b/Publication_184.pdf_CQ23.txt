To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the dataset was made diverse by including fish samples with different environment circumstances such as separated fish in seagrass, a shoal (a group of fish), tiny fish, occlusion by corals, and varying shading and light conditions. This diversity in the dataset helped the model learn to recognize fishes under various environmental factors. Secondly, data augmentation techniques were employed to extend the amount of data available for training. Data augmentation involves creating new training examples by applying transformations like rotation, scaling, or flipping to existing images. This technique helps prevent overfitting and improves the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. Lastly, the model was trained using a batch size of 16 and subdivisions set to 64. These settings allowed for efficient use of computational resources and enabled the model to learn from a larger portion of the dataset during each training step.
