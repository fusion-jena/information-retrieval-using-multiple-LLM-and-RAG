Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the provided context to determine what optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that one of the engines uses monotonic gradient descent boosting via mboost, which could suggest that gradient descent methods might be employed within the deep learning pipeline. Additionally, another engine mentioned is Extreme Gradient Boosting through xgboost, indicating that gradient boosting algorithms may also play a role in the process. But without further details about the deep learning pipeline itself, we cannot definitively state what optimization techniques are utilized.
