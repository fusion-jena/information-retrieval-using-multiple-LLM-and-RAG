Based on the provided context, there isn't any direct information about the specific preprocessing steps used before training a deep learning model. However, common preprocessing steps often involve normalization, scaling, and cleaning of the dataset. Normalization can help bring all features to the same scale, while scaling can ensure that extreme values do not skew the model. Cleaning involves removing or handling missing or inconsistent data points. These steps are crucial to improve the performance and accuracy of machine learning models, including deep learning ones.
