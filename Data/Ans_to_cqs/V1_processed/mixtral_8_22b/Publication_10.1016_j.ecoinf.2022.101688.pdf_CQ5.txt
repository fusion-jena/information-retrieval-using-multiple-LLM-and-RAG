The text does not explicitly mention the specific bioacoustic datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the CNNs were pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and later fine-tuned on the birdsong dataset. Additionally, there are references to the Hainan gibbon calls dataset and the whydah dataset, but no further details about their origin or composition are given. Therefore, based on the provided context, the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline include ImageNet, birdsong, Hainan gibbon calls, and whydah datasets.
