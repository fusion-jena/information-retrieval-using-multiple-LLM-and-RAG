Regularization methods are techniques used to prevent overfitting in machine learning and deep learning models. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the noise in the training data instead of generalizing patterns, leading to poor performance on unseen data. Two common regularization methods mentioned in the given context are dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent complex co-adaptations between neurons. By ignoring some neurons, the network becomes less sensitive to specific weights in the network and thus generalizes better. Dropout can be implemented by setting a probability value (e.g., 0.5) indicating the fraction of input units to ignore during each update.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function based on the sum of squares of all the model parameters. This encourages smaller parameter values, making the model simpler and less likely to overfit. The strength of the regularization can be controlled by adjusting the regularization coefficient (Î»), which determines how much emphasis is placed on minimizing the size of the coefficients versus fitting the training data.

In summary, both dropout and L2 regularization are effective techniques for preventing overfitting in deep learning pipelines. Dropout achieves this by ignoring certain neurons during training, while L2 regularization penalizes large parameter values, encouraging simpler models.
