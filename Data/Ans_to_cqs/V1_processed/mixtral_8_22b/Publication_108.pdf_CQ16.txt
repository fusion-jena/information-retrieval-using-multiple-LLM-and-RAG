In this scenario, the criterion used to determine when training is complete is not explicitly stated. However, there are clues that suggest the use of certain criteria. For instance, the text mentions that during the monitoring of the training of the neural network using TensorBoard, it was noticed that the validation loss was consistently lower than the training loss before the overfitting point. This suggests that one possible criterion used to determine when training is complete could be the observation of the validation loss curve. Specifically, if the validation loss stops decreasing or starts increasing significantly compared to the training loss, this might indicate that the model is starting to overfit the data, which means that further training would not improve its performance on unseen data. Therefore, reaching such a point could be considered as an indication that training should be stopped. Additionally, another common criterion used to determine when training is complete is the observation of the learning curves for both the training and validation sets. In particular, if the difference between the two curves becomes too large, this might also indicate that the model is overfitting the data, and thus further training would not be beneficial.
