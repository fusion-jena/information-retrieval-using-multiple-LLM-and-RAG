After the model training phase, there are several postprocessing steps that can be taken to evaluate the performance of the trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based models. Based on the given context, it is clear that the authors followed a specific process involving classification and validation phases. However, the exact postprocessing steps are not explicitly mentioned in the provided information. Nevertheless, some common postprocessing steps include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., and creating confusion matrices.

Saliency maps help visualize which parts of the input image contribute most to the final prediction made by the model. This can provide insights into how the model makes its decisions and whether it focuses on relevant features. Calculating various evaluation metrics allows assessing the overall performance of the model and comparing it against other models or baselines. A confusion matrix provides a detailed breakdown of correct and incorrect predictions across different classes, helping identify any systematic biases or weaknesses in the model.

In summary, while the specific postprocessing steps employed by the authors are not directly stated, common practices include generating saliency maps, computing evaluation metrics, and constructing confusion matrices to better understand and evaluate the performance of their trained CNN-based models.
