The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a grid search approach. This means that all possible combinations of the given hyperparameter values are tested to find the optimal configuration. In this case, the authors tested 216 different configurations of U-Net-like architectures with varying numbers of layers, depths, layer rates, batch normalizations, residuals, and dropouts. After testing all these combinations, they identified several of the best models suitable for forest damage segmentation. All of the best results corresponded to the configuration when the number of layers was equal to 64, and dropout was applied. The best one, whereby an additional batch normalization is applied, corresponds to the following parameters: num_layers = 64, depth = 4, layer_rate = 2, batch_norm = True, residual = False, dropout = 0.5.
