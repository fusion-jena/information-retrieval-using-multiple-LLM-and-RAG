The given context does not provide explicit details about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as the proportion or ratio of data allocated for training, testing, and validation sets. However, it mentions some relevant aspects related to data handling and processing in the context of deep learning and other machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM).

In general, when working with deep learning models, one common approach is to divide the available data into three subsets: training set, validation set, and test set. This division helps evaluate the performance of the model during different stages of development and fine-tuning. Although the exact proportions may vary depending on factors like the size of the dataset and the complexity of the task, a typical distribution could be around 60-80% for the training set, 10-20% for the validation set, and 10-20% for the test set.

The training set is used to fit the model, allowing it to learn from the input data and adjust its internal parameters accordingly. The validation set serves as a tool for tuning hyperparameters and preventing overfitting, while the test set remains unseen until the final evaluation stage, providing an independent measure of the model's predictive power.

While the given context does not explicitly mention these criteria, it discusses various aspects of deep learning and machine learning techniques applied to EF calculations. It highlights the importance of addressing nonlinear relationships among variables, dealing with high-dimensional problems, and choosing appropriate activation functions and weights for neuron connections within the network architecture. These considerations contribute to building accurate and efficient deep learning models but do not directly specify how to partition the data for training purposes.
