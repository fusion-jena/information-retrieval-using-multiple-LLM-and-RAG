During the training process, the model performance is monitored through various strategies. One such approach involves tracking the loss and accuracy development of the models, as mentioned in Figures S2 and S3. Additionally, the study employs an adversarial training procedure that optimizes shared intermediate features to be invariant between two domains. This optimization aims to minimize the loss of the label classifier while simultaneously maximizing the loss of the domain classifier. By doing so, the model can generalize better across different domains, improving its overall accuracy. Furthermore, the classification error is also utilized as a metric to evaluate the model's performance. It is visualized as a scaled confusion matrix and calculated based on the proportion of incorrect predictions made by the model.
