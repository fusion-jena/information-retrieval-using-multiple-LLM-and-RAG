To ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model, the authors employed several strategies. Firstly, they utilized a diverse dataset consisting of multiple species, including three common shark species of interest. Secondly, they conducted a 5-fold cross-validation process, where for each fold, they randomly selected 80% of their dataset Videoclips to train their model and 20% to test it. This approach helped prevent overfitting and improved the model's ability to perform well on unseen data. Lastly, instead of directly splitting images from the frame dataset, they opted to split videos into training and testing sets. This decision was made because images from the same videos tended to be highly similar, potentially leading to a model with poor generalization capacity. By ensuring full independence between images in the training and testing sets, the authors aimed to improve the overall performance and reliability of their deep learning model.
