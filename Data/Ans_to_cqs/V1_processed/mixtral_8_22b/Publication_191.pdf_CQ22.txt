The text does not explicitly mention the specific evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does indicate that the top-1 classification accuracy is computed during the experiment. Top-1 accuracy is a common metric used in image classification tasks, where the prediction is considered correct if the highest probability class matches the true label. Other possible metrics could include precision, recall, F1 score, or area under the ROC curve (AUC), depending on the nature of the task and the desired balance between false positives and false negatives. Without more information about the specific application and goals of the model, it is difficult to determine which additional metrics might be relevant.
