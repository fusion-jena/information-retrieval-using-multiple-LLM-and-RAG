Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be involved depending on the nature of the data and the specific requirements of the model. However, based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Instead, it focuses on the use of transfer learning, where pre-trained layer weights from a previous classification task on ImageNet are utilized for all Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models in this study. Additionally, the context mentions the architecture of the CNN models, including the use of global average pooling, dense layers, and parallel branches for handling different input data types. It also discusses the splitting of the dataset into training, validation, and test datasets, along with details about the training process, such as the choice of optimizer, learning rate, loss function, and metrics for evaluating the model's performance. Therefore, without additional information regarding the specific preprocessing steps taken for this particular study, I cannot provide a detailed response to the query.
