Unfortunately, based on the given context, there isn't enough information to provide a specific answer regarding the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context discusses the use of Twitter's 'Full-archive search endpoint' and the twarc2 library to access and manage the dataset, but does not mention any details about the machine learning model, such as the type of algorithm used, the evaluation metrics, or the stopping criteria for the training process. Therefore, I am unable to provide a helpful response to your query.
