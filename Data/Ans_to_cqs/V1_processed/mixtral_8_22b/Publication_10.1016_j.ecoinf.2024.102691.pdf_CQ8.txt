Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The text only mentions details about the model training, such as the input image size, batch size, and optimization methods used. There is no mention of any specific code repositories like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the location of the code repository.
