The text mentions that the VGG Image Annotator was used to manually annotate pixel coordinates to create precise polygonal mask contours directly around the fish body boundary. This suggests that the technique used for data annotation in this case is instance segmentation, where each individual object (fish body) is outlined precisely within the image. Bounding box annotation, on the other hand, involves drawing a rectangle around the object rather than outlining its exact shape. Instance segmentation provides more detailed information about the location and shape of objects in an image compared to bounding box annotation.
