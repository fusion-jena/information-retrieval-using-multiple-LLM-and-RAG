In this study, the authors utilize satellite images for their deep learning pipeline. They generate batches of size (m, 256, 256, 3) with a batch size of 20, which consist of sub-images of size 256 x 256 cropped randomly from the original satellite images. These sub-images are then combined into batches and used for training the neural network. The corresponding masks have a shape of (20, 256, 256, 1). The satellite images used for training come from sites #1, #3, #5, #7-10, while those used for validation come from sites #2, #4, #6. The network training assessment is performed on sub-images generated from image #2, and images #4 and #6 are used for visualization and demonstration of the algorithm's efficacy. Therefore, it can be concluded that the method utilized for collecting raw data in this deep learning pipeline is through the use of satellite imagery.
