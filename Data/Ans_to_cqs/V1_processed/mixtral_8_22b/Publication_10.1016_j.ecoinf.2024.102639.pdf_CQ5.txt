The given context does not provide information on the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that machine learning and deep learning have been applied to model and predict animal movement, specifically in the context of T-maze experiments involving rats and zebrafish. It can be inferred that the authors may have used custom datasets containing data related to the movements and behaviors of these animals during the T-maze experiments. Unfortunately, without further details about the study, we cannot determine which specific datasets were utilized in the deep learning pipeline.
