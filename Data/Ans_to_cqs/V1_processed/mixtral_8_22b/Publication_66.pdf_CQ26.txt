The paper does not provide specific details about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that different combinations of variables were used to explore the qualities of different models. This suggests that feature selection or engineering might have been employed to improve model performance and potentially mitigate any biases in the dataset. Additionally, the authors validate their predictions using withheld data, which is a common practice to ensure that the models generalize well to unseen data and avoid overfitting. While the paper does not explicitly mention stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, these techniques could still be relevant for addressing data bias in similar studies involving deep learning models.

Based on the given context, we cannot determine if the researchers specifically addressed data bias through methods such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, they did employ various combinations of variables to optimize their models and validated their results using withheld data. These practices help ensure the reliability and applicability of their findings.
