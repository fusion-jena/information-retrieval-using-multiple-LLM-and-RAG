Based on the provided context, there isn't explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, we can infer some strategies related to handling variability and ensuring robustness in the models.

Firstly, the authors use a Random Forest (RF) classifier for their hierarchical classification model. This choice might help mitigate the effects of randomness since ensemble methods like RF combine multiple weak learners to create a strong learner, reducing overfitting and improving overall performance.

Secondly, the dataset is divided into eleven groups based on visual morphological characteristics. By creating these distinct groups, the researchers aim to maintain consistency across them and prevent potential biases during classification. This strategy could indirectly address randomness by providing more structured and balanced data for training, validation, and testing purposes.

Thirdly, the paper mentions using separate validation and test sets for fine-tuning the model's hyperparameters. This practice helps ensure the model's generalizability and scalability when dealing with unseen datasets. Although not directly addressing randomness, this method contributes to building a more reliable and robust model capable of handling diverse inputs.

Lastly, the authors evaluate their model using two additional datasets, RTL80 and RTP40, which consist of random collections captured in real-time. These datasets serve to assess the efficiency of the proposed hierarchical classification model under varying conditions. Analyzing the model's sensitivity to different real-time scenarios may provide insights into its ability to manage randomness and adapt to changing environments.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it suggests several approaches aimed at enhancing the model's robustness and reliability. These include employing ensemble methods, maintaining consistent ratios across groups, fine-tuning hyperparameters, and evaluating the model under diverse real-time scenarios.
