Based on the provided context, there isn't explicit mention of specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning applied to the dataset before training the deep learning model. However, there are several important aspects mentioned regarding the data preparation process.

Firstly, the authors used a standard loss function that assumes a zero-mean isotropic Gaussian prior over the network parameters, corresponding to L2 regularization. This implies that the input features might be normalized or scaled to ensure they follow a similar distribution.

Secondly, the authors sampled batches of 64 reference data patches of size 15x15 pixels for training. These patches were selected based on certain criteria, including containing vegetation points with Dz > 1.3m and being classified as forested according to Norway-wide timber volume maps. This suggests that the raw data may have been processed to extract relevant features like vegetation height and forest classification.

Lastly, for each reference data patch, the authors picked an optical image from the correct year and two SAR images (ascending and descending orbits) with acquisition dates close to the optical image date. While this doesn't directly indicate any preprocessing steps, it does show that multiple types of remote sensing data were combined and synchronized for training purposes.

In conclusion, while no specific preprocessing steps are explicitly stated in the provided context, it can be inferred that the data was likely prepared by extracting relevant features, possibly applying normalization or scaling, and synchronizing different types of remote sensing data.
