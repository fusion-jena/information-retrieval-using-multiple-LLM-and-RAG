Based on the given context, it appears that the study employs a type of machine learning technique called random forest models. However, there is no explicit mention of a deep learning model being used in the text. Therefore, I cannot definitively state the purpose of a deep learning model within this context.

Random forest models are a popular choice among machine learning techniques due to their demonstrated robust performance across various applications. They belong to a category of machine learning methods known as ensemble learning, which operates by creating numerous randomized decision trees based on subsets of the input features. By averaging the outcomes from each tree, the model generates a more dependable result compared to what a single tree could achieve.

In this particular study, the authors focus on managing model complexity, defined as the number of variables included in the predictor set. This approach aims to minimize training costs, measurement requirements, and reduce the risk of overfitting. Hyperparameter optimization was carried out using Bayesian Optimization to minimize a 5k-fold cross-validation loss during model development.

While the information does not directly address the purpose of a deep learning model, it provides valuable insights into the objectives and methods employed in this research regarding machine learning techniques.
