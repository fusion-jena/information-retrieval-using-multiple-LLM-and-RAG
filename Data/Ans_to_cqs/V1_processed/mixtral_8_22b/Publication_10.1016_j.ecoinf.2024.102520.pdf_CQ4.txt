Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, or scaling being applied in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss various stages of image processing including geometric, radiometric, mosaicking, and cropping. These processes could potentially be considered as forms of data augmentation depending on their implementation. For instance, geometric transformations like rotation and scaling can be part of geometric correction, while radiometric corrections might involve adjustments similar to brightness changes in flipping operations. Nevertheless, without further details about the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the query, it is not possible to provide a definitive list of data augmentation techniques applied in this case.
