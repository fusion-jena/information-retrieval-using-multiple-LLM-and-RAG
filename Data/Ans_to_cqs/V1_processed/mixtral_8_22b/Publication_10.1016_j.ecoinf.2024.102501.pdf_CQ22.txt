To evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, several metrics are used. In the given context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Coefficient of Determination (R^2), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

Mean Squared Error (MSE): It measures the average squared difference between the actual and predicted values. Lower values of MSE indicate better fit.

Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): It is the square root of the mean of the square of all of the error. RMSE is considered an excellent measure of goodness of fit.

Coefficient of Determination (R^2): It indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable. A higher value of R^2 indicates a better fit.

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): It measures the average magnitude of errors in a set of predictions without considering their direction. Lower values of MAE indicate better fit.

From the table presented in the context, it can be observed that the WTD-GWO-SVR model has lower MSE and MAE values and higher R^2 values compared to other models like SVR, LSTM, and BPNN. This indicates that the WTD-GWO-SVR model performs better than these models in predicting DO concentration.
