The text does not explicitly state what data format is used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions several times that the data being processed is audio. For example, it talks about "audio examples" and "audio files." It also discusses the use of Mel spectrograms, which are a type of visual representation of audio signals. Therefore, based on this information, one could infer that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is likely audio.
