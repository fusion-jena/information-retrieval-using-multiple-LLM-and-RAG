The text does not provide specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the authors used a manual delineation method for classification, which involved having two classifiers work together - one with knowledge of the imagery and another with knowledge of the field sites. This collaborative effort led to more accurate classifications compared to a single classifier working independently. The use of machine learning tools is also mentioned, suggesting that some form of automated annotation might have been employed. Nevertheless, without explicit mention of bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, or any other specific technique, it cannot be definitively stated what data annotation techniques were utilized in the deep learning pipeline.
