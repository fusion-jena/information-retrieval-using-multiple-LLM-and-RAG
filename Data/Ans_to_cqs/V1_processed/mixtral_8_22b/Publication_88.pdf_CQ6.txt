Based on the given information, it appears that there isn't any explicit mention of specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning applied to the dataset before training the deep learning model. However, some general procedures can be inferred from the context.

Firstly, the datasets consist of deforestation and non-deforestation samples, indicating that the raw satellite imagery has been processed into labeled samples suitable for supervised learning. This could involve various image processing techniques like segmentation, feature extraction, etc.

Secondly, the table shows that the total number of samples varies significantly across different sets (training, validation, and testing), suggesting that the dataset might have undergone some form of splitting or partitioning.

Lastly, the description of the EF network architecture mentions Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs) and max-pooling layers, both of which are common components in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) often used for image classification tasks. ReLUs help introduce non-linearity into the model, while max-pooling reduces the spatial dimensions of the input volume.

However, without more detailed information about the exact preprocessing steps taken, it would not be possible to provide a comprehensive list of all the preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model.
