Based on the given context, there isn't any specific mention or discussion about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, generally speaking, these techniques are commonly employed in various stages of the deep learning process, especially when dealing with tasks like object detection, semantic segmentation, or instance segmentation.

Bounding box annotation involves drawing a rectangle around each object in an image, specifying its location within the image. This technique is often used in object detection tasks where the goal is to identify the presence and location of certain objects within images.

Instance segmentation, on the other hand, goes beyond mere localization and aims to delineate the exact pixels belonging to each individual object in an image. It combines aspects of both object detection and semantic segmentation, providing more detailed information about the scene depicted in the image.

In summary, while the given context does not provide explicit details regarding the use of data annotation techniques in the deep learning pipeline, common methods include bounding box annotation and instance segmentation, depending on the specific task requirements.
