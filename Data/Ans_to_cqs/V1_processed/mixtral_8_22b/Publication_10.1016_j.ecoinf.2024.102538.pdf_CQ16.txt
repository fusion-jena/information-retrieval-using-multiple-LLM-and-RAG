Training completion is determined based on the behavior of the validation loss. Specifically, if the validation loss remains constant for five consecutive epochs during training, the learning rate is reduced by a factor of 0.1. This process continues until the minimum learning rate is reached. Therefore, the criterion used to determine when training is complete is when the validation loss does not improve after several attempts to reduce the learning rate.
