In the given context, the authors discuss the use of deep learning algorithms for bacterial image recognition in environmental samples. They mention that annotating dataset images is a crucial yet time-consuming part of the modeling process. To overcome this challenge, they employed a semi-automatic annotation technique. Initially, the model was partially trained to understand the data, after which it was utilized to annotate new data before proceeding with further training. This self-annotated dataset consisted of 540 training images and 141 validation images. It was subsequently reviewed and corrected by humans. By leveraging this method, a substantial dataset could be generated within a single day. Furthermore, due to the poorer image quality obtained from the portable microscope in Kenya, a smaller dataset containing solely Kenyan images was employed to refine the model for this specific data. However, the text does not explicitly state the exact data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Nonetheless, based on common practices in computer vision tasks like object detection and semantic segmentation, it can be inferred that similar techniques might have been applied here as well.
