Based on the given context, it appears that the deep learning model being used is not explicitly mentioned as a deep learning model but rather as a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) model and Random Forest regression (RFR) method. Both of these models are machine learning algorithms used for predictive modeling.

The purpose of the CART model is to create a decision tree that can be used for either classification or regression tasks. In this case, the CART model is being used for regression to retrieve coastal bathymetry and analyze vertical water environment information. The goal is to use the CART model to predict continuous numerical outcomes, which in this case would be water depth.

Similarly, the purpose of the RFR method is also to create a predictive model, specifically for regression tasks. It works by creating multiple decision trees and combining their outputs to produce more accurate predictions. Like the CART model, the RFR method is being used here for regression to retrieve coastal bathymetry.

In summary, both the CART model and RFR method are being used for regression purposes to predict water depth and retrieve coastal bathymetry.
