According to the given context, the hyperparameters of the model are optimized through various experiments to achieve optimal performance. Specifically, the number of stacked LSTM layers, the size of the output vectors, and other necessary model hyperparameters are adjusted until the best results are obtained. However, the exact optimization technique used, whether it's grid search, random search, or another method, is not explicitly stated in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the specific optimization technique used for selecting the hyperparameters of the model.
