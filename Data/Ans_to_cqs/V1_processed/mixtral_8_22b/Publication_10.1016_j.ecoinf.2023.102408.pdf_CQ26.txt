Based on the given context, one technique used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline is stratified sampling. In this case, the authors used a stratified sampling method to allocate 70% of the samples to the training dataset and the remaining 30% to the validation dataset. This approach helps ensure that both datasets have similar distributions of the target variable, reducing potential bias caused by uneven distribution of classes or features. Other common techniques mentioned in the query but not explicitly discussed in the context include oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Oversampling involves duplicating examples from the minority class, while undersampling removes examples from the majority class to achieve a more balanced dataset. Diverse data collection aims to gather a wide variety of examples representing different scenarios, populations, or conditions to improve the generalizability of the trained model.
