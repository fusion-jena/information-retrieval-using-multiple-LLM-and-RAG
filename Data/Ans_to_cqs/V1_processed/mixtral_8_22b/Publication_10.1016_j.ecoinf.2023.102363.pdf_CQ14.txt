The text does not provide explicit information about the optimization method used for selecting the hyperparameters of the model. However, based on the given details, we can infer that some form of parameter tuning was performed. For instance, the model uses a cyclical learning rate of 0.0004 and is set to train for 50 epochs, with early stopping deployed if the validation loss doesn't improve within 10 epochs. Additionally, a dropout rate of 0.2 is applied during fine-tuning, along with DropConnect. These choices suggest that some level of experimentation or optimization took place when determining these values. Nevertheless, without further information, it cannot be definitively stated whether methods such as grid search or random search were utilized for hyperparameter optimization.
