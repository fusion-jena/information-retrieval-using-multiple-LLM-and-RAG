The pipeline uses a deep learning approach, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This can be inferred from the table provided in the context, which lists various operations such as convolution, max pool, batch norm, LRN, and linear, all of which are common layers found in CNN architectures. Additionally, the paper referenced in the context, "[31] C. Szegedy, W. Liu, Y. Jia, P. Sermanet, S. Reed, D. Anguelov, D. Erhan, V. Vanhoucke, and A. Rabinovich, 'Going deeper with convolutions,'" discusses the use of CNNs in computer vision tasks, further supporting this conclusion.
