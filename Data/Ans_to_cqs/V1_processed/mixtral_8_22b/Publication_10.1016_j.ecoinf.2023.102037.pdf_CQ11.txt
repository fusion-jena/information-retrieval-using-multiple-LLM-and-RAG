The given context does not provide information about the specific data repository link of any deep learning pipeline used for pest identification or classification. However, it mentions several studies that have utilized various datasets for this purpose. For instance, Wang et al. (2020a, 2020b, 2020c) used the "Pest24" dataset consisting of 25,378 annotated images from 24 pest species collected by an automatic imaging trap. Similarly, Rustia et al. (2021) employed data acquired by multiple wireless imaging devices installed in greenhouses under varying lighting conditions. Unfortunately, none of these sources mention a specific data repository link where these datasets are publicly available. Therefore, without additional context, it is impossible to determine the exact data repository link of the deep learning pipelines mentioned in the given context.
