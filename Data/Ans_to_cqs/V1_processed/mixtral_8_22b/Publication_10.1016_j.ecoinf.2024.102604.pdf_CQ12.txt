The given context does not provide information about the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It only mentions that a deep learning approach was employed but does not specify whether it uses convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN), transformers, or any other type of deep learning architecture. To determine which type of deep learning model is used, additional information would be required.
