The context does not provide explicit information about the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the crawling tool developed obtains data from NetCDF files, which stands for Network Common Data Form. This file format is commonly used for storing multidimensional scientific data, including satellite imagery data. Therefore, we can infer that the deep learning pipeline might be using NetCDF files containing satellite imagery data. The mentioned parameters such as reflectance, Aerosol Optical Thickness (Kd940), Chlorophyll-a concentrations, and Diffuse Attenuation Coefficient suggest that the data could be related to oceanography or atmospheric studies.
