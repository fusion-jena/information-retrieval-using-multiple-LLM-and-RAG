The information regarding the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the type of optimizer, is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, based on general practices in training deep learning models, some commonly used hyperparameters include the learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, choice of optimizer (e.g., Adam, SGD, etc.), weight decay, and others depending on the specific requirements of the task. Without further details about the exact implementation of this particular model, it is impossible to provide precise values for these hyperparameters.
