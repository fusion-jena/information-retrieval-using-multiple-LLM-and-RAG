Unfortunately, there isn't enough context to provide a direct link to the code repository of the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the text. However, based on the references cited in the paper, it can be assumed that some of these papers might contain links or resources related to their respective implementations. For instance, reference [36] discusses EfficientNet, while reference [37] talks about DenseNet. These papers may include links to their source code repositories or other relevant resources. To find the specific implementation details or code repositories for the deep learning pipelines discussed in the paper, one should refer to the original sources listed in the references section.
