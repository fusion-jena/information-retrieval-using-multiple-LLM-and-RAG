The text does not provide explicit information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, it mentions that PyTorch was used to build the deep neural network, which was trained on an Nvidia V100 GPU. It is common practice to serialize or save the trained model after completion of the training phase, but this step is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. Similarly, there is no mention of platform selection for deployment. Therefore, based on the available information, it cannot be determined what specific process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
