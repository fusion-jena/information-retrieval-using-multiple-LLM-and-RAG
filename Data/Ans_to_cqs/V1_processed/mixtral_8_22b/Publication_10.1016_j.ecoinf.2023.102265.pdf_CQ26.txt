To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. One common approach is stratified splitting, which involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the original class distribution. This ensures that both sets contain representative samples from all classes, reducing the risk of overfitting or underfitting due to imbalanced data.

Oversampling and undersampling are also popular methods for handling class imbalance. Oversampling involves duplicating examples from the minority class until its size matches that of the majority class. Undersampling, on the other hand, entails removing instances from the majority class until it reaches parity with the minority class. Both strategies aim to create balanced datasets that improve model performance by mitigating biases towards dominant classes.

Diverse data collection is another technique used to tackle data bias. By gathering diverse sources of data, including different demographics, geographical locations, and time periods, researchers can build more robust models capable of generalizing well across various scenarios. Additionally, augmenting existing datasets through synthetic generation or transformations can further enhance diversity and reduce potential biases stemming from limited sample sizes or skewed distributions.

In summary, addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline often requires employing multiple techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Each method serves a unique purpose in ensuring fair representation of all classes within the dataset, ultimately contributing to improved model accuracy and reliability.
