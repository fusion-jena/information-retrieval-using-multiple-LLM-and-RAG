Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, common practices in machine learning include monitoring metrics such as validation loss, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., during the training process. When these metrics reach a plateau or stop improving significantly, it can indicate that the model has learned all it can from the training data, suggesting that training could be stopped. Additionally, early stopping techniques can also be employed to prevent overfitting and halt training once the model starts performing worse on the validation set.
