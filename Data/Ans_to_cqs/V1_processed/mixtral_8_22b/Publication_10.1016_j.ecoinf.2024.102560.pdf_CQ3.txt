Based on the provided context, it appears there is no direct information about the specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, the context does mention the use of various datasets and methods for analysis, including the CMAP dataset for precipitation analysis, Landsat satellite datasets for investigating water surface area and salinity variations, and remote sensing approaches for developing drought zoning maps and monitoring soil salinity variations. These datasets may require different types of preprocessing and annotation depending on their intended use in the deep learning pipeline. Without more specific details about the deep learning pipeline being used, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer regarding the exact data annotation techniques employed.
