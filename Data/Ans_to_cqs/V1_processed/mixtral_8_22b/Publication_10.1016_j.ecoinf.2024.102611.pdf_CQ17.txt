The context does not provide specific information regarding the use of regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions several studies utilizing deep learning models for various applications related to plant species identification and disease detection. These studies employ techniques like dimensionality reduction with ESPCA (Barhate et al., 2023) and batch updated stochastic gradient descent (Barhate et al., 2023). Additionally, some research uses preprocessing steps like resize, segmentation, and augmentation to increase sample sizes (2022). While these methods may indirectly contribute to preventing overfitting, they are not explicitly mentioned as regularization techniques. Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot provide detailed information on the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
