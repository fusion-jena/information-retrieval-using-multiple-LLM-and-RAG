The authors used an already trained implementation of DeeplabV3+ with the COCO dataset for deriving common objects below the skyline. The COCO dataset consists of 121,408 images and a total of 883,331 object annotations divided into 184 classes. This dataset is widely used to train computer vision models and set a baseline to benchmark their performance. By using this diverse dataset, the authors aimed to improve the generalizability of their deep learning model. However, it is not explicitly mentioned whether they employed additional techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting to further enhance the model's robustness and generalizability.
