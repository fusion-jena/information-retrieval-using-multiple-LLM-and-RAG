The proposed methodology in the given context primarily focuses on improving the accuracy of object detection in underwater environments using a modified version of the YOLOv8 network. Therefore, it can be inferred that the deep learning model employed in this pipeline is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). More specifically, the authors use the C2f module for feature extraction within the YOLOv8 network. However, they identify limitations in the original implementation due to the split operation performed on features after convolution, which makes it challenging to capture comprehensive and rich feature information through half of the channel's features. To address this issue, the authors propose modifications involving dilated convolution and depthwise separable convolution to reduce computations while maintaining the ability to extract meaningful features.
