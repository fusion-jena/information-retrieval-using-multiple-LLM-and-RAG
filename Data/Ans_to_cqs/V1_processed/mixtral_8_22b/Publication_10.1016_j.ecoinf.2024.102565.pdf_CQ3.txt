The given context does not provide specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, generally speaking, there are several common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. These include:

1. Bounding Box Annotation: This technique involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects within an image to identify their location. It is commonly used for object detection tasks.

2. Semantic Segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image according to its class. For example, all pixels belonging to a car would be labeled as 'car'. This technique is often used for scene understanding tasks.

3. Instance Segmentation: Similar to semantic segmentation, but instead of grouping all instances of a class together, it separates individual instances. For example, if there were two cars in an image, they would both be labeled separately.

4. Polygon Annotation: This technique involves drawing polygonal shapes around objects within an image. It can be more precise than bounding box annotation, especially when dealing with irregularly shaped objects.

5. Landmark Annotation: This technique involves placing dots or points on key features of an object within an image. It is often used for facial recognition tasks.

6. Line Annotation: This technique involves drawing lines along certain features within an image. It is often used for lane detection tasks in autonomous driving applications.
