Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available in the given context to determine the exact code repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in this study. The authors did not mention any links to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other version control systems where they might have stored their code. Therefore, without additional information, it is impossible to accurately identify the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in this study.
