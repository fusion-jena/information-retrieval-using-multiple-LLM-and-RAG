The research conducted by Halgamuge et al. (2020) focuses on employing deep learning techniques to determine optimal optimizer selection methods for forecasting wildfire occurrences in Australia. Although the paper does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for gathering raw data within their deep learning framework, it is implied that they have created an automated algorithm for data collection purposes. However, without further information or direct reference to the exact sources of data acquisition, such as surveys, sensors, or publicly available datasets, we cannot definitively state which methods were employed for obtaining raw data in their deep learning pipeline.

On the other hand, Dowdy (2020) presents a seasonal prediction system for wildfire event forecasts in Australia. In this case, multiple datasets are examined to measure spatiotemporal variations and seasonality. While no explicit details regarding the source of these datasets are given, one can infer that the author may have relied on various types of data sources, potentially including satellite imagery, weather stations, or meteorological records. Nevertheless, without concrete evidence from the text, it remains uncertain what precise methods were utilized for acquiring raw data in the deep learning process.
