The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include Random crop, Mosaic, and various color distortions. The color distortions applied are brightness, contrast, saturation, hue, Gaussian blur, Random scaling, Random rotation, and Random horizontal flipping. These techniques help create new samples from the existing ones, thereby artificially increasing the size of the dataset. This helps improve the ability of the model to generalize and increases its accuracy on the test dataset. It also reduces the risk of overfitting and makes the model more reliable on a wider range of input data.
