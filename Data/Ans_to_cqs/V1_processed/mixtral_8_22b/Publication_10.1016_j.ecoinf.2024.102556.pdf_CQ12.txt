The text describes the use of a modified version of the Deep SORT algorithm, which incorporates a novel residual network structured with Res2Net modules and group convolution. This suggests that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is primarily based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Specifically, the architecture includes several components such as Conv+BatchNorm+SiLU integration module (CBS), Efficient Layer Aggregation Networks (ELAN), and Hybrid Convolutional (MPConv). These are all elements typically found in CNN architectures. Furthermore, the mention of convolutional kernels, feature extraction, and downsampling also points towards the use of CNNs. Therefore, we can conclude that the deep learning model employed in the described pipeline is predominantly based on Convolutional Neural Networks.
