The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that a large database of annotated photographic quadrats was used for training the custom methodology based on deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. This suggests that image data collection might have been done through underwater photography or videography, possibly involving the use of cameras or other imaging devices during dives. Additionally, one of the cited sources mentions the use of neural networks for processing underwater videos, indicating that video footage may also serve as a source of raw data. It should be noted that the exact methods employed for gathering these images are not specified in the given information.
