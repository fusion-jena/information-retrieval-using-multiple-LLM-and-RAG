The pipeline uses a type of deep learning model called a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, it employs a modified version of the ResNet50 architecture, which is known for its strong performance in various tasks, including those within the bioacoustic domain. This model was chosen due to its ability to effectively extract features from input data, making it well-suited for tasks like object recognition in images and, in this case, identifying specific sounds in audio recordings.
