The given context does not provide information about the specific data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. However, some common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, and shifting. These techniques help increase the amount of training data available for building models, which can improve their performance and generalization capabilities. It is important to note that the choice of data augmentation technique depends on the nature of the problem being solved and the characteristics of the dataset.
