Unfortunately, based on the given information, I cannot provide a specific answer regarding the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. There is no mention of the use of a deep learning model in the provided text, nor any details about how such a model might have been deployed if it existed.

However, generally speaking, after training a deep learning model, common practices include saving the model architecture and weights (model serialization), selecting a platform suitable for running the model (platform selection), and finally deploying the serialized model onto the chosen platform. This could involve integrating the model into a web application, mobile app, or edge device, depending on the intended use case.
