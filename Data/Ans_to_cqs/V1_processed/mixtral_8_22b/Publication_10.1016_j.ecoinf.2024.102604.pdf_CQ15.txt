The text does not provide specific information on the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, common optimization techniques used in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). These techniques help adjust the parameters of the model during training to minimize the loss function and improve the accuracy of predictions. Other popular optimization techniques include Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp) and AdaGrad. Each technique has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice depends on factors like the complexity of the problem, computational resources available, and desired convergence speed.

The text primarily focuses on the use of machine learning methods such as Random Forests (RF), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), and Maximum Entropy (Maxent) in species distribution modeling (SDM). It also discusses the performance of different bias correction methods under varying presence sample sizes and bias types. Unfortunately, it does not explicitly mention any optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
