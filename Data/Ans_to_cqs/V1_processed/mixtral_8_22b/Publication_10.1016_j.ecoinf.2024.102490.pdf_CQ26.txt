The given context does not provide direct information about addressing data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, based on common practices in machine learning and deep learning, several techniques can be employed to handle data bias. These include stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified sampling involves dividing the dataset into strata or subgroups before selecting samples from each group. This ensures that the sample represents the population accurately. Oversampling increases the number of instances in the minority class by replicating them, while undersampling reduces the majority class size. Both methods aim to balance the classes in imbalanced datasets.

Diverse data collection focuses on gathering data from various sources and perspectives to reduce bias caused by limited representation. It helps capture different aspects of the problem space and improves model performance.

These techniques can help mitigate data bias during preprocessing and improve the overall performance of deep learning models.
