The given context does not provide specific details on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, such as using methods like grid search or random search. However, based on common practices in machine learning, these optimization techniques could have been used to find the best set of hyperparameters for the model. Grid search involves trying all possible combinations of hyperparameter values from specified ranges, while random search randomly selects combinations within those ranges. Other methods include Bayesian Optimization, which uses probabilistic models to guide the search process. Without explicit information about the optimization method used, we can only infer that one of these methods might have been employed.
