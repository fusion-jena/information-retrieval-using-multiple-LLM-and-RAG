The context does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, common practices in machine learning include splitting the dataset randomly or stratified based on class labels. Typically, the data is divided into 60-80% for training, 10-20% for testing, and another 10-20% for validation. Cross-validation techniques such as k-fold cross-validation can also be used to ensure robustness and generalization of the model. It should be noted that the specific criteria for splitting the data may depend on factors like the size of the dataset, class imbalance, and the nature of the problem being addressed.
