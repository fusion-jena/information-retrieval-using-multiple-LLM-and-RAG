The data is split into two subsets for training and validation purposes. Instead of using a per-image splitting approach, which could result in imbalanced sets due to varying insect numbers in different images, a unique strategy is adopted. Each image is vertically divided into halves, with one half assigned to the training subset and the other to the validation set. This method ensures a balanced distribution of insect numbers across both subsets. No pre-processing operations like segmenting the trap region from the background are performed on the images before processing.
