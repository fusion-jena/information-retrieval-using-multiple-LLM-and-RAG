The original pictures and data from Finnmark and Yamal can be obtained from the authors upon request. The Finnmark data is available from the Climate-Ecological Observatory for Arctic Tundra (COAT) database (doi:10.48425/6jytn3ga). The code and detailed instructions for the workflow are available on GitHub (<https://github.com/gerlis22/CameraTrap.git>). However, it does not explicitly mention a specific data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, the data might not be publicly accessible through these platforms but can still be requested directly from the authors or accessed via the COAT database.
