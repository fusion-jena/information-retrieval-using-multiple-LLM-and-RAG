Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide the exact code repository link of the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context. However, it can be inferred that the authors might have used popular deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow, considering they explicitly mention using its backend for training their Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

To find the specific code repository, one could search for relevant papers published by the same authors or look for open-source projects related to the described methodology. Additionally, searching through platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket using keywords from the paper may lead to discovering the desired code repository.

However, without more details about the authors, publication date, or other identifying factors, providing a direct link to the code repository is currently impossible.
