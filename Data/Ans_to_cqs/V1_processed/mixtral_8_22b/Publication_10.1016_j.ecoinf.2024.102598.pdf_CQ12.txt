Based on the given context, it appears that the study does not explicitly mention the use of any specific deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. Instead, the research focuses on applying various Machine Learning Models (MLMs) to analyze forest fire dynamics. These include models based on Decision Tree, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Na√Øve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest (RF).

To enhance prediction accuracy, the authors utilize Ensemble Modeling, which combines the outputs of several individual models to produce a single output. In this case, the AUC-weighted ensemble method is applied to integrate the predictions from all models.

While the text mentions recent advancements in machine learning models and their ability to handle complex datasets, there is no explicit reference to the application of deep learning models in this particular study. Therefore, without further clarification, it cannot be determined what type of deep learning model, if any, is used in the pipeline.
