The text does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. However, it does indicate that the model employed a deep neural network (DNN) architecture with layers containing 11 to 3 neurons, utilizing the ReLU activation function for hidden layers and the sigmoid activation function for the output layer. Additionally, the model incorporated a long short-term memory (LSTM) block into the DNN architecture. The implementation of these classification methods was done in Python using the TensorFlow and Scikit-learn libraries. Despite the lack of explicit information about the hyperparameters, one can infer that common hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and optimizers (such as Adam, SGD, or RMSprop) would have been considered during the development and optimization of the model.
