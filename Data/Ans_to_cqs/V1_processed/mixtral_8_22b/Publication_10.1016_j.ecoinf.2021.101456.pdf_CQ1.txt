The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) for processing and analyzing data. It also mentions the use of a dataset recorded at a different location, which suggests that the data could have been collected using various methods such as sensors or surveys. Additionally, the context refers to a study that uses polarization lidar measurements of honey bees in flight for locating land mines, indicating that sensor data may have been used in that particular case. Overall, while the exact method of data collection is not specified in the provided context, it implies that various methods such as sensors, surveys, or public datasets could potentially be used depending on the application.
