Unfortunately, the given context does not provide explicit information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. However, it mentions that the validation set is used during training to fine-tune hyperparameters. This implies that various hyperparameters were adjusted throughout the training process to achieve optimal performance. Common hyperparameters in deep learning models include learning rate, batch size, epochs, momentum, weight decay, and others depending on the specific model and task. Without further details, I cannot provide a precise list of hyperparameters used in this particular case.
