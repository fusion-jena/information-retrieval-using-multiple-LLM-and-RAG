The text does not provide explicit details about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it mentions the use of ensemble modeling to enhance predictive accuracy, increase stability, improve generalization, provide robustness against overfitting, and increase model interpretability. It also discusses the employment of a bootstrapping approach using the spThin package in R to minimize the removal of records and significantly mitigate sampling bias. Additionally, spatially-constrained and combined methods were utilized for generating background points, which showed greater efficacy in modeling outcomes. These approaches could potentially contribute to reducing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
