The given context does not provide explicit details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the study uses a "Hyperparameter-tuned batch-updated stochastic gradient descent" method for plant species identification. This suggests that the authors have likely tuned various hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and possibly others like momentum or weight decay. Unfortunately, without more specific information, we cannot definitively state what those values might be.
