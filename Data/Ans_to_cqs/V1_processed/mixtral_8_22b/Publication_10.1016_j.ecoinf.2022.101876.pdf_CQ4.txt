The text does not provide explicit information about the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the researchers used a state-of-the-art computer vision model called MegaDetector, which leverages machine learning to automate data processing tasks like detecting and classifying wildlife in images. While the exact data augmentation techniques used are not mentioned, typical methods include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, and adjusting brightness or contrast. It can be assumed that the researchers may have employed one or more of these techniques during the development and training of their model.
