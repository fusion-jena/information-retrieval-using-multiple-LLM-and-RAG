The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model like DeeplabV3+. However, generally speaking, some common preprocessing steps include data normalization, scaling, cleaning, and augmentation. Data normalization involves rescaling the input features so they fall within a specific range, often between 0 and 1. Scaling can also help ensure that all features contribute equally to the final output. Cleaning refers to removing any irrelevant or redundant data points, while augmentation involves creating new samples through transformations like rotation, flipping, or cropping. These techniques aim to improve the model's generalizability and prevent overfitting. In the case of DeeplabV3+, the authors mention using an already trained implementation with the COCO dataset, but do not elaborate on any specific preprocessing steps applied to the dataset prior to training.
