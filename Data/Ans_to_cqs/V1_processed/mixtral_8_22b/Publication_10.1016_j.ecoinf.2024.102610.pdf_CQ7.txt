The text does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it mentions that the separation of training and test data should be done beforehand but warns against introducing bias, especially when dealing with data containing many zeros. The authors suggest using spatial cross-validation techniques to bolster model robustness. Spatial cross-validation involves randomly selecting blocks of data for training while reserving others for testing, repeating this process multiple times based on the number of specified folds. This method helps refine the model's estimation of prediction errors and enhances overall performance.
