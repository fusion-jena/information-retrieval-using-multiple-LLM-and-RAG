Based on the given context, it appears that a deep learning model was utilized; however, its specific purpose or application (such as classification, segmentation, or detection) has not been explicitly mentioned. The article focuses on environmental flows, riparian ecosystems, wetlands, and biodiversity maintenance, suggesting that the model might be related to these topics. In Section 6, there is mention of discussing the advantages and limitations of the model and future work, which implies that the model plays a significant role in the research. However, without further information about the model itself, it is difficult to determine its exact purpose or application within this context.
