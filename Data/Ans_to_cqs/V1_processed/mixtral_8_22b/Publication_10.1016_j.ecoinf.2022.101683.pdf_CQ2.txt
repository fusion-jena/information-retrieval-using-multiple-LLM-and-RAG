The information provided does not contain any specific details about the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer based on this context alone. However, common data formats used in deep learning pipelines include images (JPEG, PNG), audio files (WAV, MP3), videos (MP4, AVI), and structured data such as CSV or Excel files.
