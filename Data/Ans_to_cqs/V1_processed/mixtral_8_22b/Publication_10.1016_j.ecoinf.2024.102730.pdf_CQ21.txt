After training the MLP models, the authors conducted several postprocessing steps. Firstly, they calculated metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Average Error (MAE), and Coefficient of Determination (R^2) to evaluate the performance of the models. They specifically focused on minimizing the MSE during the grid search process to identify the optimal set of hyperparameters. Secondly, they computed SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values using the model-agnostic Kernel SHAP method. This step was taken to understand which features were most important in predicting the start and height of the greening season. SHAP values help explain the output of a machine learning model by calculating the contribution of each feature to the prediction. Lastly, although not explicitly mentioned in the given text, creating visualizations like saliency maps could also have been part of the postprocessing steps. However, since the study focuses on regression tasks rather than image recognition or classification, confusion matrices would not apply here.
