The information provided does not specify the type of data format used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the data format used is image, audio, video, CSV, or any other format.

Based on the given context, we can see that the author discusses various aspects of ecological modeling, including selecting classifiers, using modeling packages, and applying multiple methods to detect overlapping outcomes. However, there is no mention of the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, without additional context, it is impossible to determine what data formats were used in this particular case.
