The given context does not provide direct information about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge, several techniques can be employed to mitigate data bias.

Stratified Splitting: In stratified sampling, the dataset is divided into subsets or strata, ensuring that each subset maintains the same distribution of classes as the original dataset. This technique helps maintain class balance across different stages of the deep learning pipeline.

Oversampling: Oversampling involves duplicating samples from the minority class to achieve a balanced dataset. Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is one popular oversampling technique where synthetic examples are created along the line segments joining any/all k-nearest neighbors of the minority class.

Undersampling: Undersampling reduces the number of majority class samples to match the size of the minority class. Random Under-Sampling (RUS), NearMiss, and Tomek Links are some common undersampling techniques.

Diverse Data Collection: Collecting diverse data ensures that the dataset represents various scenarios, reducing potential biases introduced due to limited representation. This includes collecting data from multiple sources, demographics, geographical locations, etc.

It should be noted that the choice of technique depends on factors such as the nature of the problem, available resources, and the specific type of bias present in the dataset.
