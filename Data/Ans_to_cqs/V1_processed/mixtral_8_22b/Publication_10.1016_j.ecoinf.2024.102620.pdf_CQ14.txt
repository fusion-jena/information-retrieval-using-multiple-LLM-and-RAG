Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to provide a specific answer regarding how the hyperparameters of the PLUS or CASA models are optimized using methods such as grid search or random search. These optimization techniques are commonly used in machine learning models to find the best combination of hyperparameters that result in optimal performance. However, without explicit mention of these methods being applied to either the PLUS or CASA models, it cannot be confirmed if they were used for hyperparameter tuning.
