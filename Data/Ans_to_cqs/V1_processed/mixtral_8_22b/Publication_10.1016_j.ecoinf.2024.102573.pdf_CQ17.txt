The given context does not provide information about specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, there are mentions of techniques that could be considered forms of regularization or help improve model robustness.

One technique mentioned is the use of large neural networks, which can handle minor variations in input caused by different compression schemes. This suggests that larger networks may have inherent regularization properties due to their capacity to generalize well even when faced with varying input conditions.

Additionally, the text discusses the application of Per-Channel Energy Normalization (PCEN), which whitens the data by Gaussianizing the magnitudes and decorrelating the frequency bands. This process helps alleviate stationary background noise and improves the model's ability to recognize species from outdoor recordings. Although not explicitly stated, applying PCEN can be seen as a form of feature normalization, which contributes to improving model performance and preventing overfitting.

Lastly, the context mentions the use of input normalization applied to the backend's input, which is the frontend's output. Input normalization ensures that features have consistent scales across different examples, making the learning process more efficient and reducing the risk of overfitting.

In conclusion, while the given context does not directly address the query regarding specific regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization, it highlights the use of large neural networks, Per-Channel Energy Normalization (PCEN), and input normalization as techniques that contribute to improved model performance and reduced overfitting.
