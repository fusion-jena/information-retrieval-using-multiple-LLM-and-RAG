The metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this case is the Area Under the Receiving Operator Characteristics Curve (AUC). This index was used to specify the accuracy of the model. A higher AUC value indicates that the model is more accurate. Cross-validation was also employed by using 70% of the dataset as training data to build the models and the other 30% as testing data to calculate the models’ accuracy.
