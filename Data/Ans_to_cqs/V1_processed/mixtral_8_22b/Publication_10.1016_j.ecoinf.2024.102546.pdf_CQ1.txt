The study utilizes a combination of methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Initially, a systematic search is conducted in major databases such as Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and arXiv using relevant keywords like "weed dataset", "weed database", "agriculture", "machine vision" and "computer vision". To automate the process, the Python library "scholarly" is used to retrieve publication records. This results in the collection of 451 records from the literature search. Additionally, various publicly available weed datasets are also considered, which include different types of imagery such as RGB, HSI, MSI, Multimodal, and RGB-D. These datasets have varying numbers of images and species, with some containing more than 10,000 images. However, it should be noted that most of these datasets are limited to controlled indoor settings, which may limit their applicability in real-world scenarios.
