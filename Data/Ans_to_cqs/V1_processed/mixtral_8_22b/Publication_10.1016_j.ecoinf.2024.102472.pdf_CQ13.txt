In the given context, there is no explicit mention of the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. However, based on the information available, we can infer that some hyperparameters have been adjusted and tuned during the model development process.

For instance, in the case of Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN), the optimal learning rate (0.01), momentum (0.18), and training iterations (500) were determined after conducting several tests. These parameters are crucial in adjusting the connection weights during the training phase to reach a target minimum error.

Additionally, the text mentions Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), which is known for its speed and accurate prediction process. XGBoost allows for model tuning through various hyperparameters such as ntree, tree node size, and gradient boosting iteration. Although the exact values of these hyperparameters are not mentioned, their importance in minimizing bias error within and between spectral predictors is highlighted.

Lastly, the context states that all hyperparameters were tuned using a grid search method. Grid search is a common technique used in machine learning to find the best combination of hyperparameters for a particular algorithm. It involves specifying a set of possible values for each parameter and evaluating the performance of the model for every combination of those values.

Therefore, while the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are not explicitly stated, we can conclude that they include learning rate, momentum, training iterations, ntree, tree node size, and gradient boosting iteration. These hyperparameters were likely fine-tuned using a grid search method to achieve optimal performance.
