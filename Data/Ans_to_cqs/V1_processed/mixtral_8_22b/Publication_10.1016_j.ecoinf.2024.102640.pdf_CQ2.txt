Based on the given context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily uses images as the data format. This is evident from the mention of using SegFormer, a state-of-the-art Transformer-based model for semantic segmentation, which is typically applied to images. Furthermore, the context mentions the use of ImageNet-1K dataset for initialization, which is a large-scale image database. Additionally, the Cross-Entropy loss function mentioned is commonly used in image classification tasks. Therefore, it can be concluded that the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is images. However, without explicit information about other potential data formats such as audio or video, it cannot be definitively stated that these formats are not also utilized in some capacity within the overall system.
