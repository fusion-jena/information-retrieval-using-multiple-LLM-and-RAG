The deep learning architecture described in this study uses the ADAM optimization technique. This method is a stochastic gradient descent algorithm that is based on adaptive estimation of first-order and second-order moments. It was developed by Kingma and Ba in 2017 and is known for its computational efficiency and low memory requirements. In this particular case, it is being used to optimize the parameters of the recurrent neural network model during training. Other popular optimization methods include standard stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and other variants like RMSprop and Adagrad. However, these are not mentioned in the given context.
