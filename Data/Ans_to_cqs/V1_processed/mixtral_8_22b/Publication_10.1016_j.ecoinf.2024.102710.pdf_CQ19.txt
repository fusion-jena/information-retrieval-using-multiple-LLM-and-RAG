The deep learning models mentioned in the given context use TensorFlow as the underlying framework. This is evident from the usage of 'tensorflow.keras.applications.vgg16.VGG16' and 'tensorflow.keras.applications.resnet\_v2.ResNet152V2', which are part of the TensorFlow library. Additionally, the TFHub links provided ('https://tfhub.dev/google/vggish/1' and 'https://tfhub.dev/google/yamnet/1') further confirm the use of TensorFlow. However, it should be noted that while these models use TensorFlow, other parts of the project might utilize different libraries or frameworks.
