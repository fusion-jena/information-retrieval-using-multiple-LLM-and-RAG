The given context does not provide any direct information about the evaluation metrics used for assessing the performance of a deep learning model. However, based on common practices in machine learning, some possible metrics could include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, etc. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of total instances. Precision indicates the ratio of true positive predictions to all predicted positives. Recall shows the fraction of correctly identified positives among actual positives. The F1 score combines both precision and recall into a single metric. Lastly, the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve plots True Positive Rate against False Positive Rate, providing a graphical representation of the model's performance.
