The paper uses two types of evaluation metrics to assess the performance of their deep learning models: top-1 accuracy and top-5 accuracy. Top-1 accuracy measures whether the correct label is predicted as the highest probability among all possible labels. On the other hand, top-5 accuracy considers the prediction successful if the correct label appears within the top five probabilities. In the experiments conducted, the authors report both top-1 and top-5 accuracies for different scenarios. They observe that the results are significantly better in scenario 4 compared to scenario 3, indicating that the Species Selection Bias Problem (SSPB) introduces a significant bias in the accuracy of leaf-based automated species identification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Specifically, they find that top-5 accuracy is nearly 100% with the biased dataset, but drops to 51% with the unbiased dataset. Similarly, top-1 accuracy shows a difference of about 50% between the biased and unbiased datasets.
