The given context does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the type of optimizer employed during training. However, it can be inferred from the context that the authors experimented with different approaches to improve their baseline model, which was a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) consisting of two convolutional layers, max pooling, a flattening operation, and two fully connected layers. They aimed to incorporate additional contextual information without significantly increasing the complexity of the model or the number of parameters. In one of these experiments, they utilized a multi-branch CNN to maintain model simplicity while integrating more data. Unfortunately, no explicit mention of the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model is present in the provided context.
