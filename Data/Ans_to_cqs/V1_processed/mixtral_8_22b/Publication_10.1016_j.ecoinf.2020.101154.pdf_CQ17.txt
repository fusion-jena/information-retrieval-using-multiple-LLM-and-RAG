Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization being used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, some techniques mentioned in the text can help mitigate overfitting. For instance, the use of a low learning rate and shallow trees (also known as tree stumps) in Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT) can contribute to preventing overfitting by reducing the complexity of the model. Additionally, the early stopping technique is employed to halt the model training process once the validation error starts increasing, thus avoiding unnecessary iterations that could lead to overfitting.
