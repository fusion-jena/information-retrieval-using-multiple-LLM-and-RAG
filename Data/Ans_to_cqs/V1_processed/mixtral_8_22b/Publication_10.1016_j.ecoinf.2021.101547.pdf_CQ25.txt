The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is object detection, specifically for identifying polar bears in aerial survey imagery. This is evident from the use of the residual network ResNet-50, which has been pre-trained on millions of images from the ImageNet database to recognize various objects, including animals. Additionally, the mention of setting relative learning weights for both the 'bear class' and 'background class' further supports the notion that the model is being trained for object detection.
