The text does not provide explicit information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions that the minimum MaxEnt value was used as a threshold for classifying a cell as a suitable species' habitat during model training. It also states that the decision thresholds were not biased due to the fact that temperature (T) and precipitation (P) changes, along with other parameters within complex prediction functions in the MaxEnt models, frequently produced very different cell values across the years. Additionally, the text notes that model thresholding was necessary before combining the different species models for species richness estimation, as they were mutually independent and had very different probability distributions. These details suggest that the model performance may have been monitored by evaluating the consistency and variability of predicted cell values across time and between different species models.
