The deep learning pipeline described in the given context uses bird audio data as its input format. This audio data is then processed and transformed into various forms such as the WT spectrum, STFT spectrum, HHT spectrum, and MFCC features. These transformed data formats serve as inputs for further processing and classification steps within the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, the primary data format utilized in this particular deep learning pipeline is audio data.
