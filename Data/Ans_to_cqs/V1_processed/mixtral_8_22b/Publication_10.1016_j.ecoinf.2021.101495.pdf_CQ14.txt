The table titled "Hyperparameters used for the training of each neural network" provides information about the search spaces for various hyperparameters such as epochs, batch size, learning rate, activation function, and train/test split ratio. It also lists the best assignments for these hyperparameters. However, the method used to find these optimal values is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. Therefore, based solely on this information, we cannot definitively determine whether techniques like grid search, random search, or manual tuning were employed to optimize the hyperparameters.
