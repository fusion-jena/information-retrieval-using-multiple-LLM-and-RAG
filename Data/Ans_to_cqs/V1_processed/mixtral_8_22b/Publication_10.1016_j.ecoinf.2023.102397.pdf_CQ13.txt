Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The only related piece of information is from Benkendorf and Hawkins (2020), who analyzed the effects of sample size and network depth on a deep learning approach to species distribution modeling. They found that increasing the number of hidden layers improved the performance of the model. However, this does not directly address the specific hyperparameters mentioned in the query. Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
