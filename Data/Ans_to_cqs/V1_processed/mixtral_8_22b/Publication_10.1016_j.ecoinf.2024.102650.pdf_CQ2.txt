The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that tweets were used as part of the dataset, indicating that textual data was involved. Additionally, the use of machine learning techniques like the Enhanced Representation through Knowledge Integration (ERNIE) model suggests that structured or semi-structured data might have been utilized. Unfortunately, without more detailed information, we cannot definitively state whether other data formats such as images, audio, video, or CSV files were employed in the deep learning pipeline.
