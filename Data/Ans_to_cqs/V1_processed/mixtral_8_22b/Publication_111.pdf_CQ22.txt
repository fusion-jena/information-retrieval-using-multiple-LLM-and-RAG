The paper uses four different evaluation metrics to compare the performance of the deep learning model against the machine learning and statistical models. These metrics include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and R2 score. However, it does not mention using traditional classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall. This suggests that the problem addressed in the paper might be a regression task rather than a classification task. Therefore, the mentioned metrics are more suitable for evaluating the performance of the models in terms of their ability to accurately predict continuous variables like Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Significant Wave Height (SWH).
