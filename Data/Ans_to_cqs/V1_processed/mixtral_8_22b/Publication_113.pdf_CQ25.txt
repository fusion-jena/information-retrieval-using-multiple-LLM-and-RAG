The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is likely being used for object detection, as mentioned in section 3.4 where the authors discuss validating their method against the NACTI dataset using MegaDetector, an object detection model. Additionally, in section 1, the authors mention that object detection models can help handle multiple species in images and eliminate background pixels from subsequent classification tasks. Therefore, it can be assumed that the deep learning model is intended for object detection purposes.
