Based on the given context, there is no direct information about the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, some commonly used techniques include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. These methods can help ensure that the training dataset is representative of the population and reduce any potential biases.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets based on certain characteristics or labels, ensuring that each subset has roughly the same proportion of these characteristics. This helps maintain the balance between different classes when creating training and testing datasets.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to handle class imbalance in datasets. Oversampling increases the number of instances from the minority class, while undersampling reduces the number of instances from the majority class. Both methods aim to create a more balanced dataset, which can improve model performance.

Diverse data collection focuses on gathering data from various sources and populations to minimize sampling bias and ensure that the dataset accurately represents the target population. This technique can be particularly useful when dealing with underrepresented groups or rare events.

Without further context, it is not possible to determine which, if any, of these techniques were employed in the study referenced in the provided context.
