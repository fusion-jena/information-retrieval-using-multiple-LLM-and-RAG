To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed. One common approach is fixing the random seed value, which ensures reproducibility of experiments. By setting a fixed seed, the sequence of pseudo-random numbers generated will always be the same, allowing for consistent results across different runs of the same experiment. Another strategy is to use deterministic algorithms or operations where possible, reducing the reliance on random processes. Additionally, techniques such as cross-validation and ensemble methods can help improve robustness and reduce variability due to randomness. Cross-validation involves splitting the dataset into multiple subsets and training/testing models on each subset, while ensemble methods combine multiple models to produce more stable predictions. These strategies together can help manage randomness in the deep learning pipeline and improve overall performance.

Based on the given context, there is no direct information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, from general knowledge, we can provide some strategies used to address this issue.
