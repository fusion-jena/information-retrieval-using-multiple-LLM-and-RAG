The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, based on common practices and the available information about the training parameters, we can infer some possible strategies.

One common method to monitor a deep learning model's performance during training is by using validation datasets. The model's performance on this dataset provides insights into how well it generalizes to unseen data. In this case, the authors might have used a separate set of images from the Vasiliko site for validation purposes.

Additionally, the table lists several hyperparameters related to the learning rate schedule, which could also help monitor the model's progress during training. For instance, the base learning rate, learning rate decay factor, learning rate decay step, and learning power are all relevant factors affecting the optimization process. By observing these values over time, one can assess whether the learning rate is too high or low, causing underfitting or overfitting, respectively.

Furthermore, other parameters such as momentum, weight decay, train batch size, and train crop size may influence the model's convergence speed and overall performance. Monitoring these aspects throughout the training phase allows researchers to adjust them accordingly if needed.

In conclusion, while there isn't explicit mention of the specific strategy employed to monitor the model performance during training, it is likely that the authors utilized techniques like validation sets and tracking various hyperparameters related to the learning rate schedule and optimization process.
