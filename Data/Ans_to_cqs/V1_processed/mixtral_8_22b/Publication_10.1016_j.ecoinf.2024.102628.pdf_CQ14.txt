The hyperparameters of the model are optimized by tuning the'mtry' hyperparameter using the caret package in R. Other hyperparameters are kept at their default values. Additionally, variations in the 'ntree' parameter are explored by experimenting with different settings such as 500, 1000, 5000, and 10,000. Furthermore, features are selected prior to training using the 'findCorrelation' function in the Caret package in R with a cutoff of 0.7.
