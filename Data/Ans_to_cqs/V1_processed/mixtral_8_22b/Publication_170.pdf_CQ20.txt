Two different hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model. For the first experiment, a GPU server with two Intel Xeon E5-2600 v4 processors, 256 GB RAM, and two NVIDIA Tesla K80 with 24 GB GDDR5 Graphics Card is utilized. In contrast, the third experiment uses a desktop PC with one NVIDIA GeForce GT 730 with 2 GB GDDR5 Graphics Card. Both these hardware resources employ GPUs for training the deep learning model.
