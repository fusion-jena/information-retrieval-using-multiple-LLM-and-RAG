The deep learning models mentioned in the given context are Unet, DeepLabV3+, and PSPNet. Here are the hyperparameters used for these models:

Unet:
- Initial Learning Rate: 0.01
- Optimizer: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
- Activation Function: ReLu
- Loss Function: Dice Loss
- Number of Iterations: 150
- Batch Size: 4
- Downsampling Multiplier: 8

DeepLabV3+:
- Initial Learning Rate: 0.0001
- Optimizer: Adam
- Activation Function: ReLu
- Loss Function: Dice Loss
- Number of Iterations: 150
- Batch Size: 2

PSPNet:
Unfortunately, the information about the hyperparameters used for PSPNet is not explicitly stated in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide this information.
