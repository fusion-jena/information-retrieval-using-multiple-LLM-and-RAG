To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves partitioning the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes or labels in both sets. This ensures that the model does not become biased towards any particular class due to unequal representation.

Oversampling is a technique where samples from the minority class are duplicated to balance the dataset. This helps prevent the model from being dominated by the majority class. However, this method may lead to overfitting if not handled carefully.

Undersampling, on the other hand, involves removing samples from the majority class to achieve balanced datasets. While this reduces the risk of overfitting, it also leads to loss of information.

Diverse data collection aims to gather more representative data by including various sources, environments, and conditions. This approach can help reduce bias caused by limited or unrepresentative data.

These techniques should be chosen based on the specific requirements and constraints of the problem at hand. For instance, if there is a significant imbalance between classes, oversampling or undersampling might be appropriate. Conversely, if the available data is not sufficiently diverse, collecting additional data could be beneficial.
