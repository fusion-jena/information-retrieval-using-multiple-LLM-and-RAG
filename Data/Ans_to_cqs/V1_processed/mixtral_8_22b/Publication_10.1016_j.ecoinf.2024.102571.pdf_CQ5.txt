The information provided does not explicitly mention any specific dataset used in a deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it appears to focus on various research papers and articles discussing topics like water pollution control, greenhouse gas emissions, global nitrogen and phosphate levels, and other environmental concerns. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline based on this given context.
