The text does not provide explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it mentions the use of transfer learning, which involves using pretrained models on larger datasets and fine-tuning them on the target dataset. This approach helps leverage the knowledge gained from the larger dataset and improves the performance on the target dataset, even if it is relatively small. Additionally, the text discusses employing active learning strategies, where the model iteratively selects the most informative unlabeled samples for labeling based on certain criteria. These strategies help improve the model's performance and generalizability by focusing on the most valuable samples during the learning process.
