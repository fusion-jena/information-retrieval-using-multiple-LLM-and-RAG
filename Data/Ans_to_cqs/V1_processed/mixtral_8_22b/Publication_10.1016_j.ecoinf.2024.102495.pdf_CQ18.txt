To monitor the model performance during training, the study employs a technique called cross-validation or k-fold validation. This method involves dividing the dataset into 'k' subsets or folds, where one subset is used for testing while the remaining 'k - 1' subsets are used for training. This process is repeated 'k' times, ensuring that every subset serves as the test set once. By doing so, the researchers can evaluate the model's performance across different data splits, providing a more robust assessment of its generalization capabilities. Furthermore, the authors use various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC score to measure the model's performance. These metrics help quantify the effectiveness of the proposed deep learning approach in classifying mosquito species based on their wingbeat frequencies accurately.
