The given context does not provide explicit information regarding specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some indications that suggest possible strategies used to improve the model's performance and robustness.

Firstly, it is mentioned that the distribution of samples is representative of the landscape's real class proportions. This implies that the dataset was created with careful consideration of class representativeness, which can help prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.

Secondly, the context mentions that the samples were split into training and validation sets according to a 60%â€“40% ratio. Although this alone does not guarantee generalizability, it suggests that some form of validation was performed during the development process. Cross-validation or stratified splitting could have been employed to further enhance the model's reliability and reduce bias.

Lastly, the reference to Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) resources might indicate that additional external datasets were utilized to supplement the primary dataset. Incorporating diverse datasets can contribute to improving the model's adaptability and overall performance across different scenarios.

In conclusion, while the given context does not explicitly state the use of techniques such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, there are hints suggesting that these methods may have been applied to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
