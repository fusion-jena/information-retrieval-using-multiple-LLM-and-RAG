The given context does not provide specific details about data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotation, or scaling. However, it discusses the use of bagging, a popular ensemble method in machine learning, to improve model performance and leverage spatial autocorrelation information for predictions. Bagging involves creating multiple subsets of the original dataset through bootstrapping and training individual models on these subsets. These models are then combined to create an ensemble predictor. This technique helps reduce bias during model training, especially when dealing with clustered data. While not directly related to data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling images, bagging is another approach to improving model performance and reducing overfitting.
