The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the given context varies depending on their specific applications. However, most of them are primarily focused on object detection, segmentation, or both. For instance, the work by Liu and Abd-Elrahman (2018) uses a deep convolutional neural network for wetlands classification, which involves classifying different types of wetlands. On the other hand, Martins et al. (2021) use machine learning and SLIC for tree canopy segmentation in urban areas, focusing on identifying and delineating individual tree crowns. Similarly, Chen et al. (2021) employ the PointNet of deep learning for individual tree crown segmentation directly from UAV-borne LiDAR data. Lastly, Do et al. (2022) utilize the birdâ€™s eye view (BEV) Faster region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) algorithm for segmentation purposes, as shown in Figure 9 and Table 6. Therefore, it can be concluded that the primary purpose of these deep learning models is either classification or segmentation, depending on the specific application and dataset being analyzed.
