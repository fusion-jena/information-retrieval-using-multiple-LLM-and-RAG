Unfortunately, based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about which specific deep learning framework was used to build the models mentioned - ResNet-50, InceptionV3, or InceptionResNetV2. However, these architectures can be implemented using popular deep learning libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch. For instance, both TensorFlow and PyTorch provide implementations of ResNet-50, InceptionV3, and InceptionResNetV2 in their respective Model Zoos. Therefore, without further context, we cannot definitively state which framework was used to build these models.
