The provided context does not directly address the handling of randomness in the deep learning pipeline or the use of random seed values. However, it discusses the use of AI and machine learning models to automate tasks such as detecting and classifying wildlife in images collected by camera traps. This involves using computer vision models built through machine learning techniques, but it doesn't explicitly mention strategies for dealing with randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

In general, when working with deep learning pipelines, there are several ways to manage randomness. One common strategy is setting a fixed random seed value before running any code involving random processes. By doing so, researchers ensure reproducibility and consistency across different runs of their experiments. Another method is employing cross-validation techniques like k-fold validation, where the dataset is divided into multiple subsets, and each subset serves as a test set once while the remaining ones form the training set. This helps reduce overfitting and improves the robustness of the model. Lastly, ensemble methods combine multiple models trained independently to produce better predictions, effectively mitigating the impact of randomness during individual model training.
