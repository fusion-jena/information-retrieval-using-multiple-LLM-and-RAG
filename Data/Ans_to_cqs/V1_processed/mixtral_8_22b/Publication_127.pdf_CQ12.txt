In the given context, the pipeline uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) called the VGG model. The VGG model is mentioned in Table 1 as having 22 layers and being part of the pipeline for classifying whether an image contains an animal or not. Additionally, the context mentions other deep learning architectures such as NiN, GoogLeNet, and ResNet, which are also types of CNNs. However, the specific pipeline described here utilizes the VGG model.
