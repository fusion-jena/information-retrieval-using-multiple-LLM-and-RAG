After the model training, there are several postprocessing steps involved in the supervised learning workflow. These steps are outlined in Sections 2.3.1-2.3.5. Specifically, Section 2.3.5 details the accuracy, export, and land cover count processes.

Accuracy assessment is crucial to evaluate the performance of the trained model. This involves calculating metrics such as overall accuracy, producer's accuracy, and user's accuracy. These metrics can be found in Table 3 for each photo job. Additionally, a confusion matrix can be generated to visualize the performance of the model.

Exporting the results is another important step in the postprocessing phase. In this case, the classified woody cover map was exported as a GeoTIFF file. This allows for further analysis and integration with other geospatial data.

Finally, land cover counts were performed on the classified woody cover map. This involved counting the number of pixels belonging to each land cover class within the study area. This information can provide valuable insights into the distribution and abundance of different land cover types.
