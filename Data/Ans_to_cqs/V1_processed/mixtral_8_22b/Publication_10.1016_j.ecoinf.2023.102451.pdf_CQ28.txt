Unfortunately, there isn't enough information provided to determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. The details mentioned include operating system, processor, RAM, programming language, development environment, input dataset, input dimensions, batch size, loss, activation function, learning rate, epochs, and optimizer. However, none of them specify the deployment platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer based on the given context.
