I apologize for any confusion, but based on the provided context, there doesn't seem to be information about data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Instead, the context discusses data filtering and processing using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform for environmental data analysis. It mentions retrieving data catalogues from the GEE online repository, applying filters like date range and geographical clipping, and preprocessing the identified image series. Additionally, it highlights challenges related to flexible data scaling due to differences in sensor characteristics and large volumes of data, and how platforms like GEE provide solutions with their storage and computational capabilities. However, without further context, I cannot provide details on data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
