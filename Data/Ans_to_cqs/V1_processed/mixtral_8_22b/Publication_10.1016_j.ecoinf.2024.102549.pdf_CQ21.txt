After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the project. In this case, some possible postprocessing steps include calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, creating saliency maps to visualize the important features learned by the model, and generating a confusion matrix to evaluate the performance of the model.

According to Fig. 4, the accuracy comparison of different pixels was conducted, and the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of the final selected 21 pixels were calculated. Additionally, a confusion matrix of the 21 pixels was generated to further assess the performance of the model. These postprocessing steps provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the model and help improve its overall performance.
