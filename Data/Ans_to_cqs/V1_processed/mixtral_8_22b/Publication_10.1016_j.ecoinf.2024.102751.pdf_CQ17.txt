Regularization methods are techniques used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise along with underlying patterns, resulting in poor generalization performance on unseen data. Two common regularization methods are Dropout and L2 Regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, effectively creating a different network architecture for each iteration. This helps reduce interdependent learning among neurons and encourages them to learn individually useful features. During testing, all neurons are included but their outputs are scaled down proportionally to the dropout rate used during training.

L2 Regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. This discourages large weights, promoting simpler models that generalize better. The strength of the penalty is controlled by a hyperparameter called the regularization parameter.

Other regularization methods include L1 Regularization, Early Stopping, and Data Augmentation. L1 Regularization promotes sparsity in the learned weights, while Early Stopping halts training once validation error starts increasing. Data Augmentation generates additional training examples by applying transformations like rotation, scaling, or flipping to existing samples, helping improve model robustness and reducing overfitting.
