Unfortunately, based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of any specific deep learning framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch being used to build the MLPnn-MC model. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the exact framework utilized in this case. However, these popular deep learning libraries could potentially be employed to implement such a model.
