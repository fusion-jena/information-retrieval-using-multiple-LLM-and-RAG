The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in this context is classification. Specifically, it aims to accurately categorize Cervidae, a family of deer, using a hybrid network called CA-Hybrid. This network combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Vision Transformers (ViT), and Class Activation Maps (CAM) to improve its overall performance.

The CA-Hybrid network leverages the strengths of both CNN and ViT architectures. CNNs are known for their strong local information extraction abilities, while ViT excels at capturing global dependencies. By integrating these two models, the CA-Hybrid network can effectively extract richer semantic features, leading to improved classification results.

Moreover, the introduction of CAM within the CNN module allows the network to focus more on critical features, enhancing its generalization ability. This is particularly useful when dealing with different classes of objects belonging to the same species, like various types of deer, where subtle differences might be crucial for accurate identification.

In summary, the primary goal of this deep learning model is to classify Cervidae using a hybrid approach that combines the advantages of CNN, ViT, and CAM. This design choice enables the network to achieve higher classification accuracy, especially for larger images, and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed monitoring pipeline.
