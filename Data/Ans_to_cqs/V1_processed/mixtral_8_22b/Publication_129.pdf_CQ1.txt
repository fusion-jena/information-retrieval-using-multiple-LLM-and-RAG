The papers cited do not provide explicit information about the method used for collecting raw data in their respective deep learning pipelines. However, some clues can be inferred based on the nature of the research. For instance, paper [18] focuses on analyzing water pollution for agricultural irrigation resources using a deep learning CNN architecture. It is likely that they collected raw data using various sensors or sampling techniques to measure water quality parameters. On the other hand, paper [19] introduces a large-scale benchmark dataset for insect pest recognition, suggesting that they might have gathered images from publicly available sources or created their own dataset using image acquisition devices like cameras. Similarly, paper [20] discusses automatic localization and count of agricultural crop pests based on an improved deep learning pipeline, implying that they could have used sensors or imagery data to collect relevant information. Lastly, paper [21] presents a benchmarking of learning strategies for pest detection and identification on tomato plants using internal databases, indicating that they may have relied on existing datasets or captured images themselves using specialized equipment. Overall, while the exact methods for gathering raw data are not explicitly stated, one can infer that the researchers likely used a combination of sensors, surveys, and public datasets depending on the specific requirements of their projects.
