Based on the provided context, there is no information about the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. However, common metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and Area Under Curve (AUC). Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions made. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made. Recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positives. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single measure of performance. The AUC represents the degree or measure of separability between classes. These metrics are often used in conjunction with one another to provide a comprehensive evaluation of a deep learning model's performance.
