The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the provided context is primarily focused on classification tasks. Specifically, the text mentions the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for generalized identification solutions in ecological studies. These networks are particularly useful when dealing with multiple features for classification purposes. In this case, the goal is to classify bird species and distinguish between various behaviors, such as feeding chicks or engaging in nest maintenance activities.

Moreover, the discussion highlights the importance of having a diverse training dataset to account for variations in recording conditions like light intensity, shadows, and image quality. This ensures that the deep learning model can accurately classify objects under different circumstances. Additionally, the authors suggest collecting large labeled datasets over time to address limitations related to temporal changes in appearance, such as moulting in birds.

Overall, the primary objective of the deep learning model described in the provided context is to enable researchers to efficiently and accurately identify individual animals through image analysis, thereby improving the efficiency of ecological studies.
