The given context does not explicitly mention where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it mentions a reference to a paper by Stowell (2021) titled "Computational Bioacoustics with Deep Learning: A Review and Roadmap." It might be possible that the author has mentioned the data repository in this review article. Unfortunately, without access to the full text of this article, we cannot confirm if the data repository is indeed mentioned there. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, we do not know where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
