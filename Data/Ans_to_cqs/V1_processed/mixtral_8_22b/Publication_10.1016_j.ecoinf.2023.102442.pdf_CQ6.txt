The context does not provide explicit information about specific preprocessing steps used before training a deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that some form of data preparation or preprocessing might have been performed due to the nature of the research. For instance, in the study by Elmes et al. (2020), they use a Sentinel-2 based multispectral convolutional neural network for detecting artisanal small-scale mining in Ghana. This implies that the input data must have undergone some sort of processing to extract relevant features such as spectral bands. Similarly, Girardin et al. (2016) analyze seasonal trends of Amazonian forest phenology using remote sensing data, which also suggests that their data may have gone through preprocessing steps like atmospheric correction or radiometric calibration. Furthermore, Gorelick et al. (2017) discuss the use of Google Earth Engine for planetary-scale geospatial analysis, indicating that raw satellite imagery would need to be processed into usable formats suitable for deep learning models.

In general, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and augmentation. Normalization involves rescaling the input features so that they fall within a certain range, typically between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. Scaling adjusts the magnitude of feature values without changing their distribution, often done when different features have vastly different scales. Cleaning removes noise or irrelevant information from the dataset, while augmentation generates new samples by applying transformations to existing ones, helping improve model robustness and prevent overfitting.
