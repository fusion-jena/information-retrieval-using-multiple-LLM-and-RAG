The text does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline apart from the COCO dataset. However, it mentions that they used the Mask-RCNN algorithm, which is typically pretrained on the COCO dataset. They also mentioned using transfer learning from the COCO dataset. Additionally, they used the ResNet-101 network for heavier augmentation, but no specific dataset is mentioned for this purpose.
