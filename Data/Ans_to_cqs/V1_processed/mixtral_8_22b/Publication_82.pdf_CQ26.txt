Based on the given context, it is not explicitly mentioned what specific techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, there are several common techniques used in machine learning and deep learning pipelines to mitigate data bias, including stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified sampling involves dividing the dataset into different strata or groups based on certain characteristics, then randomly selecting samples from each group to ensure that the sample represents the overall population accurately. This technique can help prevent overrepresentation or underrepresentation of certain classes or features in the dataset.

Oversampling and undersampling involve adjusting the class balance in the dataset by either duplicating examples from the minority class (oversampling) or reducing the number of examples from the majority class (undersampling). These techniques can help improve the performance of the model on imbalanced datasets.

Finally, collecting diverse data can also help reduce data bias by ensuring that the dataset includes a wide variety of examples representing different scenarios, populations, and perspectives. In this study, the authors mention using various types of datasets, including color, grayscale, and segmented datasets, which could potentially help address data bias related to lighting conditions and other factors.

However, without more explicit information about the specific techniques used in this study, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer to the query.
