The article from Medium titled "Improving Cloud Detection with Machine Learning" discusses a deep learning model used for cloud detection in satellite imagery. However, it does not provide explicit information about the specific type of deep learning model used (classification, segmentation, or detection).

On the other hand, the Ecological Informatics article focuses on using Earth Observation data, specifically from Sentinel-2 satellites, to map and monitor wetlands in East Africa. While this research uses machine learning techniques, there is no clear indication of the exact purpose of the deep learning model employed.

Lastly, the Chambaud et al. paper published in Heliyon describes national wetland mapping using remote sensing derived environmental variables, archive field data, and artificial intelligence. This study also lacks explicit details regarding the specific purpose of the deep learning model utilized.

Based on these sources, we cannot definitively determine the purpose of the deep learning models mentioned (classification, segmentation, or detection). Further information would be required to accurately address this query.
