The papers mentioned do not directly discuss the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, generally speaking, common preprocessing steps include normalization or standardization of input features to ensure they have a consistent scale, handling missing values through imputation methods, encoding categorical variables if necessary, and potentially transforming skewed distributions to improve model performance. These steps can help improve the efficiency and accuracy of the deep learning model.
