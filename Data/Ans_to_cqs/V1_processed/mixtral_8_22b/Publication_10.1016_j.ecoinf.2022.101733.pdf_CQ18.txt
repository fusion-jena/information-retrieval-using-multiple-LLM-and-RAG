The text does not provide explicit information on the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions that after collecting the samples, they were divided into training and validation sets with a 60%-40% ratio, respectively. This suggests that the authors might have used cross-validation techniques to evaluate the model's performance during training. Additionally, the text states that a few points were collected through field surveying for visual assessment of classification performance, indicating that qualitative evaluation methods could have been employed as well. Nevertheless, without more detailed information, it cannot be definitively stated what exact monitoring strategy was utilized.
