The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of a validation set. This validation set is used to evaluate the modeling and tune its hyperparameters. The performance of the model on this validation set is monitored by maximizing the R-value using the grid search method. During the first stage of optimization, the neural network structure and the number of neurons in the hidden layers are adjusted. A total of 60 sets of combinations are considered for this purpose. In the second stage, the percentage of the dropout layers, the learning rate, and the batch size are adjusted to obtain the optimal model.
