To monitor the model performance during training, the authors employed a validation set consisting of 243 images for the 640 x 640 pixels input resolution and 255 images for the 1280 x 1280 pixels input resolution. They also utilized a 10:10 split ratio for both the validation and testing sets, respectively. Furthermore, they independently trained five different versions of the YOLOv5 model family, namely YOLOv5n, YOLOv5s, YOLOv5m, YOLOv5l, and YOLOv5x models, to detect alates on sorghum leaves. During the training phase, the authors conducted initial computational experiments with various combinations of epochs (300, 400, and 500) and batch sizes (8, 16, and 32) to determine the optimal hyperparameters for their training. Ultimately, they found that the optimal hyperparameters were 400 epochs with a batch size of 8.
