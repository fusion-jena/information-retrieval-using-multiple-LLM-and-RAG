The provided context does not directly address the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it is important to note that handling randomness is crucial in ensuring reproducibility and consistency in machine learning models, including those used for wetland mapping and other applications mentioned in the given references.

Some common strategies to manage randomness include setting fixed seeds for reproducible results, employing cross-validation techniques to reduce overfitting, and utilizing ensemble methods like Random Forest or gradient boosting algorithms (such as LightGBM) to improve overall performance and robustness. These strategies can help mitigate the impact of randomness on model outcomes and contribute to more reliable and accurate predictions.
