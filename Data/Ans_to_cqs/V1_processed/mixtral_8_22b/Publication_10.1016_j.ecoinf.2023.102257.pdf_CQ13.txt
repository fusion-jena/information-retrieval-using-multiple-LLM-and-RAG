The given context does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text only mentions that a machine learning (ML) bounding box model was used for accelerating the data labelling process and that its performance was evaluated based on its effects on tagging efficiency. It also discusses the results of the experiment, which showed that ML bounding boxes offered significant improvement in tagging efficiency compared to unassisted tagging, but that gains were contingent on the ML algorithm's performance. However, no details regarding the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are mentioned in the provided context.
