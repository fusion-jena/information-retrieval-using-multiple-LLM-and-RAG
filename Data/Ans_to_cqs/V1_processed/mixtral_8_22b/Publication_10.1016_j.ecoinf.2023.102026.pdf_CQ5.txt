The text does not provide information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it mentions that the study uses a dataset consisting of camera trap data on several species. This dataset is used for both the Generalized Linear Model (GLM) and Random Forest (RF) approaches. In the case of the RF approach, the authors use two different training data selection frameworks: non-bootstrapped RF and bootstrapped RF. For the non-bootstrapped RF, they use the same training dataset used for the non-bootstrapped GLM, which consists of randomly selected 80% of camera trap locations. For the bootstrapped RF, they subsample the entire camera trap dataset by randomly selecting 20% of the presence and absence locations. They then train RF with the subsampled dataset and produce the species distribution probability surface. This process is repeated 100 times, producing 100 different probability surfaces, which are then averaged to obtain the final species distribution probability surfaces.
