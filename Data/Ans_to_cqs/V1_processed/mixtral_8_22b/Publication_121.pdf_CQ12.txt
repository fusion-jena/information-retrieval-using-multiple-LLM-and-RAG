In the given context, it is mentioned that the authors have used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) as their deep learning model. Specifically, they have utilized pre-trained models such as MobileNetV2, MobileNetV3-Large, and MobileNetV3-Small, which are variants of CNN architectures designed for efficient execution on mobile devices. These models have been fine-tuned and adapted for the specific task of plant and tree species identification.
