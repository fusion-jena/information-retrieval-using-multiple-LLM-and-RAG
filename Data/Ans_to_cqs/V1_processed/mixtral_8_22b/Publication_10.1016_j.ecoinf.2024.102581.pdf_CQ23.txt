Based on the given information, it appears that the authors used two datasets for their study - Mendeley and CVIP100. However, there is no explicit mention of any specific measure taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. Nevertheless, using multiple diverse datasets could help improve the robustness and generalization ability of a model. Additionally, techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting might have been employed during training to further enhance the model's performance across different subsets of data. However, without more detailed information about the methodology used, it is not possible to definitively state what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
