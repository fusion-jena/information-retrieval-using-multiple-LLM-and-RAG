Based on the given information, the specific format of the input data used in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned. However, we can infer from the context that the data might be in a structured format like CSV since the work involves data analysis using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn. These libraries are commonly used for handling tabular data. Additionally, the use of Keras, a popular deep learning library, suggests that the data could potentially be transformed into numerical arrays to train neural networks. Nevertheless, without explicit confirmation, it remains uncertain whether the data includes formats like images, audio, or video.
