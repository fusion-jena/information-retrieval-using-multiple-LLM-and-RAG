Based on the given information, it does not explicitly state which type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding whether they used a convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), or transformer model. However, the authors mention using artificial neural networks, support vector machines (SVM), and random forests for landslide susceptibility prediction. These methods do not fall under the category of deep learning models but rather traditional machine learning techniques. To find out if any deep learning models were employed, further details about their approach would be required.
