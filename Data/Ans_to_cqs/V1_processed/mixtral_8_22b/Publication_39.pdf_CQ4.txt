The deep learning pipeline employs various data augmentation techniques to enhance the performance of its models. These techniques include horizontal flip, adding or subtracting intensity, Gaussian blur, additive Gaussian noise, and Fog simulation. The mentioned augmentation techniques are all applied simultaneously except for Fog, which is combined solely with the random horizontal flip due to its strong impact. The Fog augmentation is carried out with a probability of 10%, while the other combined augmentation techniques are executed with a probability of 90%.

In addition to these techniques, three specific augmentation methods are utilized for action recognition: temporal jittering, spatial crops, and horizontal flips. Temporal jittering involves selecting the starting point of the 16 frames in the input video randomly, ensuring that there are still 16 frames available after this point within the video. Spatial crops involve cropping the image spatially, while horizontal flips entail horizontally flipping the image.

These data augmentation techniques contribute significantly to improving the robustness and accuracy of the deep learning models by increasing the diversity of the training data without acquiring new examples.
