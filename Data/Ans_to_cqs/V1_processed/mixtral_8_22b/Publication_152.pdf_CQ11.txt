Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no information about a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in this work. The context only mentions that U-Net was chosen as the neural network architecture and implemented using Python 3.7 Keras framework. It also discusses various configurations tested during training, such as brightness changes, small zooms, and different seasons. However, it does not provide any details regarding where the dataset or code can be accessed. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested data repository link.
