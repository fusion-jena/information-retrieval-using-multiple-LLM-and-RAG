The study applies data augmentation techniques using the train_datagen instance of ImageDataGenerator. This generator implements various transformations on the training images, including rotation up to 20 degrees, width and height shifting up to 20% of the total image size, shearing with a maximum of 20 degrees, zooming with a maximum factor of 20%, and horizontal flipping. Additionally, the fill\_mode parameter is set to 'nearest' to handle any potential gaps or missing pixels resulting from the transformations.
