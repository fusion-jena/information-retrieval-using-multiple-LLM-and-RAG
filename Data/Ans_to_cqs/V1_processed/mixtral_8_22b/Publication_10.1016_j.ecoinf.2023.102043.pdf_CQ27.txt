Unfortunately, there isn't enough information provided to determine what specific process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, typically after training a deep learning model, the next steps would involve saving or serializing the model, selecting a platform for deployment, and then integrating the saved model into the chosen platform. This could include setting up any necessary infrastructure, such as servers or cloud services, and configuring the system to use the serialized model for making predictions. Without further details about the specific case, I can only provide this general overview of the typical process.
