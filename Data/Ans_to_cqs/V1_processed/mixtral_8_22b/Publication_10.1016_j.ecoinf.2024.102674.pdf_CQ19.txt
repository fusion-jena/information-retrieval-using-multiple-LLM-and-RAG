The text does not provide explicit information about which specific deep learning framework is used to build the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the Random Forests (RFs) were built using the RANDOMFOREST R package, and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs) were built using the GBM R package. These packages are part of the R programming language environment, but they do not belong to any popular deep learning framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, based on this information, I cannot determine which deep learning framework was used to build the deep learning model mentioned in the paper.
