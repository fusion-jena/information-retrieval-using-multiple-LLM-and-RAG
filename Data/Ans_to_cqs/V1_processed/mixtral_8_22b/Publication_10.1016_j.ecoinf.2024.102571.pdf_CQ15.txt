The text does not provide explicit information about the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of a three-layer feedforward back-propagation neural network with a 30-20-10 architecture and activation functions such as tansig and purelin. These details suggest that some form of gradient descent optimization technique is likely being employed, but the exact method (such as Stochastic Gradient Descent or Adam) remains unspecified within this context.
