The text does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, such as using methods like grid search or random search. However, it does mention that the study experimented with different parameters, including 'conv_base.trainable' and 'Dropout Rate', for models like VGG19, ResNet50, and their combinations. These experiments resulted in varying outcomes, as shown in Tables 8 and 9. It can be inferred that the researchers might have tried different values for these parameters to find the optimal configuration for each model. Nevertheless, without specific details regarding the optimization method, it cannot be confirmed whether they employed techniques like grid search or random search.
