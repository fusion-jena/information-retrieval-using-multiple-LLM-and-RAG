The text does not provide explicit information about how the dataset was divided into training, testing, or validation sets. However, it mentions that the deep feature loss bird noise reduction network model was trained for 50 epochs on an RTX 2080 Ti GPU using the Adam optimizer. This suggests that there must have been a separate training set used for this purpose. Additionally, the authors compare their proposed method with other bioacoustic noise reduction algorithms using the same test set, which implies that they had a distinct test set for evaluating performance. Unfortunately, no specific details regarding the size or proportion of these datasets are given in the provided context.
