To ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model, B.R. Pushpa et al. took several measures. Firstly, they maintained consistent ratios across different groups while training, testing, and validating the samples. This was done to prevent potential biases during classification. Secondly, they included diverse samples across various groups to establish the reliability and generalizability of the model. Thirdly, they utilized separate validation and test sets for evaluation purposes. These sets helped fine-tune the model's hyperparameters, contributing to its scalability and applicability to unseen datasets. Lastly, it can be inferred from the use of a Random Forest (RF) classifier in both levels of the hierarchical classification model that cross-validation might have been employed. However, this information isn't explicitly stated in the provided context. In summary, maintaining consistent ratios, using diverse samples, employing separate validation and test sets, and possibly implementing cross-validation techniques ensured the generalizability of the deep learning model developed by B.R. Pushpa et al.
