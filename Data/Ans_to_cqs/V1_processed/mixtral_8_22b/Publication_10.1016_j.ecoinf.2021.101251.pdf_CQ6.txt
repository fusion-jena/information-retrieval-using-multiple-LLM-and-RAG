Based on the given context, it does not provide explicit information about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, I can infer from the context that some common preprocessing steps might include processing, cleaning, and curating the data. These steps could involve tasks like normalizing or scaling numerical features, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and removing outliers. It is important to note that the exact preprocessing steps will depend on the nature of the data and the specific requirements of the deep learning model being trained.
