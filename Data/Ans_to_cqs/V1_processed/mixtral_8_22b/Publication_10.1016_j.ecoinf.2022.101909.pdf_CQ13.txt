Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the type of optimizer employed. It mainly focuses on describing the application of the transfer learning and fine-tuning techniques with the ResNet50 model, along with its input size and modifications made to the top network. For more detailed information regarding the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, additional sources would need to be consulted.
