The provided context does not explicitly mention which specific type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the context that deep neural networks are being used for bioacoustic classification tasks, particularly for large datasets involving marine mammals. The mentioned papers by Frainer et al., Frasier et al., Li et al., Roman Ruiz et al., and Zhong et al. likely discuss or employ various types of deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), or transformers. To determine the exact type of deep learning model used in these studies, one would need to refer directly to those sources.
