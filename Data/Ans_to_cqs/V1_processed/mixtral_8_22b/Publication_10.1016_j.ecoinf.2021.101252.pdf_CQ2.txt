The text does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that deep learning models can be applied to various types of temporal data, which could include formats like time series data, images, sounds, etc. It also discusses the application of deep learning models in ecological studies, specifically for the classification of image and sound data. Therefore, based on the information given, it can be inferred that the deep learning pipeline discussed here may involve different data formats depending on the type of analysis being performed.
