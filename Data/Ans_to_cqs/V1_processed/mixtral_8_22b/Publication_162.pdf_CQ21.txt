After the model training process, there are several postprocessing steps that can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the project. Here are some common postprocessing steps mentioned in the given context:

1. False alarm filtering: The first step involves sorting out recordings that do not contain animal images due to false alarms from the motion detector. This helps reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed further.
2. Masking irrelevant image areas: Another step involves masking out image areas where no animals can appear. This reduces the data volume even further and makes processing faster and more efficient.
3. Breakdown of images: After filtering out irrelevant data, the remaining images are broken down into their individual components and analyzed. This could involve breaking down the image into dark areas that are approximately the size of the objects being classified.
4. Iterative training: Once the initial training phase is complete, the system may use a feedback mechanism to improve performance over time. This involves forwarding certain images to humans for manual annotation and then using those images to train the classifier iteratively.
5. Evaluation: Finally, evaluation is carried out with a retained test set of images that have been manually annotated. This helps assess the accuracy and effectiveness of the trained model.

It should be noted that the exact postprocessing steps required will depend on the specific goals and constraints of the project. However, the above steps provide a general overview of some common postprocessing techniques used in machine learning projects involving image classification.
