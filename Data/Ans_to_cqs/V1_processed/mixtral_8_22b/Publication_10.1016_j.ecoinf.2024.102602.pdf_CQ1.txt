The text discusses various methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for ecological studies. One method mentioned is using citizen science or social media platforms to acquire data. This can be done easily through APIs or scraping methods, allowing for quick and automated collection of big digital data. However, it is noted that not all social media and citizen science platforms permit data scraping due to their respective terms and conditions. Another method discussed is utilizing artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning and deep learning algorithms like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to analyze online digital images. These techniques have been applied to tasks such as recognizing plant diseases, classifying land cover, and identifying animals in camera trap images with minimal human supervision.
