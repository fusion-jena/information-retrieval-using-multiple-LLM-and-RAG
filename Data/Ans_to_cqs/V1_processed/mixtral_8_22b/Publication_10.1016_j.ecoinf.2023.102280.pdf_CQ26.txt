The text does not explicitly mention any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses some general challenges related to collecting and preparing training data for deep learning-based denoising methods in bioacoustics applications.

One challenge mentioned is the difficulty in obtaining clean recordings, especially for wild animal populations. In some cases, capturing clean data might only be feasible by recording captive animals, which may not represent the broader population accurately. To overcome this issue, researchers could employ diverse data collection strategies, aiming to gather samples from different environments, seasons, and individual animals.

Another challenge discussed is the generation of training data for fine-tuning deep learning models. Typically, clean data is collected, and noise profiles are superimposed to create both input data and a 'denoised' ground truth. This process might introduce biases if the selected noise profiles do not adequately represent the real-world conditions encountered in the target environment. Researchers should carefully select and balance their noise profiles to minimize potential biases.

Although the text does not directly refer to stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling, these techniques could potentially help mitigate data imbalances and improve model performance. For instance, stratified splitting ensures that each class is proportionally represented across all data splits, while oversampling and undersampling adjust the distribution of classes within the dataset.

In summary, while the text does not specifically list techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, it highlights several challenges related to data collection and preparation in bioacoustics applications. Strategies like diverse data collection, careful selection of noise profiles, and possibly using techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling could help tackle these issues and reduce potential biases in the training data.
