Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the model was trained using 30 epochs per training task, based on validation runs. Additionally, it discusses how the model uses a stochastic gradient algorithm during the learning process.
