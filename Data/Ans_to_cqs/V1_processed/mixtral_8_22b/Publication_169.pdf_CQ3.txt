The given context does not provide specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it discusses various aspects related to deep learning, including the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for image recognition tasks. It mentions the integration of CNN and LSTM layers to effectively aggregate feature maps for precise classification and accurate recognition. Additionally, it lists some common CNN architectures like AlexNet, PredNet, GoogLeNet, Overfeat, and VGG, which have been widely used for image data recognition tasks. Unfortunately, without explicit details regarding the data annotation methods employed within these pipelines, it is impossible to determine the exact techniques utilized.
