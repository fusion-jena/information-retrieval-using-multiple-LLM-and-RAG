Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to determine what specific data augmentation techniques were applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context only mentions that the audio files are segmented into 15-second windows and each window is passed to a feature extraction function which uses Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) to extract features for the classifier. It does not provide any details about whether or how data augmentation was performed on the input data before passing it to the feature extraction function. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to the query based on the given context alone.
