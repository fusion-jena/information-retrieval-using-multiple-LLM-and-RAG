The given context does not provide information on the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. However, since BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is mentioned, it can be assumed that the Hugging Face library, which provides pretrained BERT models, might have been used. This library supports popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. Therefore, either TensorFlow or PyTorch could potentially have been used to build the deep learning model.
