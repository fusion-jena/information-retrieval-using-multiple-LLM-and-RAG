Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be applied to improve its performance. These may include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing or correcting erroneous data points, handling missing values, and eliminating outliers. It ensures that only relevant information is fed into the model.

2. Normalization: This process scales numeric variables to a common range to prevent attributes with larger magnitudes from dominating those with smaller ones. Common techniques include Min-Max Scaling, Decimal Scaling, and Z-Score Normalization.

3. Feature Selection: This step aims to reduce dimensionality by selecting a subset of relevant features for use in model construction. Techniques like correlation matrix analysis, backward feature elimination, and forward feature construction can be employed.

4. Encoding Categorical Variables: Deep learning models require input data to be numerical. Therefore, categorical variables need to be converted into numerical form. One popular technique is one-hot encoding.

5. Data Augmentation: To increase the amount of available training data, various transformations can be applied to existing samples. For images, this could involve rotations, translations, zooming, etc.

6. Splitting Dataset: Before training, it's essential to split the dataset into three subsets: training set, validation set, and test set. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set helps tune hyperparameters, and the test set evaluates the final model's performance.
