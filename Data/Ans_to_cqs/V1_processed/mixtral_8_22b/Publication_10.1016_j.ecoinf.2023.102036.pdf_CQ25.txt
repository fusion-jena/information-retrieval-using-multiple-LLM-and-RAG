The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, considering the context, it can be inferred that the deep learning model might be used for image classification tasks. This assumption is based on the mention of 'a small number of classes to be identified', which suggests that the model could be classifying images into different categories or classes. Additionally, the text mentions 'K labelled images in each category', further supporting the idea of using the deep learning model for image classification purposes. Nevertheless, without explicit information about the specific task the model is designed for, this remains an educated guess.
