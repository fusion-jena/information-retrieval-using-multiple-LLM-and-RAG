Based on the given information, there are several indications that suggest measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning models developed in this study. However, specific details about the use of diverse datasets, cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other explicit validation strategies are not directly mentioned. Nevertheless, some relevant points include:

1. The researchers contributed the largest fully labeled snow leopard dataset for deep learning research, which implies that their dataset was likely diverse enough to capture different aspects of the problem domain.

2. They anticipated that their novel deep learning methods would encourage other academics to contribute more datasets to Whiskerbook.org, suggesting that continuous improvement and expansion of the dataset were considered important factors for maintaining the robustness and applicability of the deep learning pipeline.

3. To evaluate the effectiveness of various techniques, the researchers computed the top-k accuracy on a test set, with k=1, 5, and 10 representing the position of the correct match within a list of proposed matches. This approach suggests that multiple evaluation metrics were employed to measure the performance of the models across different scenarios, contributing to the overall reliability and validity of the findings.

While the text does not explicitly mention the use of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other specific validation strategies, the abovementioned points indicate that the researchers took steps to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning models.
