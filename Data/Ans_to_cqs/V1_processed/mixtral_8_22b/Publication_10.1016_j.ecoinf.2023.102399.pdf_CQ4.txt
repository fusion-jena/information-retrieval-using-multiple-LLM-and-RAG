The paper does not provide explicit details about the data augmentation techniques used in their deep learning pipeline. However, common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, translation, and color space transformations. These techniques help improve model performance by increasing the amount of training data and reducing overfitting. It would be best to refer to the original paper or contact the authors for precise information regarding the data augmentation methods employed in their study.
