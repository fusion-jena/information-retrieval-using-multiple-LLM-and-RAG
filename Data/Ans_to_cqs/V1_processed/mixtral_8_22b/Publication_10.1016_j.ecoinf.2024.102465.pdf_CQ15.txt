Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any specific optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it does state that a pre-trained ERNIE model was employed, which suggests that some form of transfer learning may have been implemented. Additionally, the use of the HRNet model implies that this could potentially involve optimizing hyperparameters related to network architecture and training parameters. Nonetheless, without further information regarding the exact implementation details, it cannot be definitively stated what specific optimization techniques were applied in the deep learning pipeline.
