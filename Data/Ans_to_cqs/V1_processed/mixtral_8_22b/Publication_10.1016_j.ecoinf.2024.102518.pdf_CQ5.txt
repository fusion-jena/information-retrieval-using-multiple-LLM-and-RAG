The given context does not provide any specific details about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it provides various numerical values related to different categories like 'highly suitable habitat,''suitable habitat,' and'marginally suitable habitat.' It also mentions the use of the Continuous Boyce Index (CBI) and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC) for evaluating the performance of the model. However, without explicit mention of the dataset names, we cannot confirm which datasets were used in this particular case.
