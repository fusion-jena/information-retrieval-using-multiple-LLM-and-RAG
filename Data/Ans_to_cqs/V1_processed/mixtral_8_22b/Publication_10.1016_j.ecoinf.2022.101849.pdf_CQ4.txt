The given context does not provide information on the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotation, or scaling. Instead, it discusses various methods of handling weakly labeled data in machine learning tasks, specifically focusing on a case study involving predictive modeling of global vegetation cover. The paper introduces a new computational setting called'structural incompleteness,' which deals with target labels that do not meet certain constraints. It also compares three methods of reducing target values to simulate artificial incompleteness: uniform reduction, random reduction, and non-random (biased) reduction. These methods aim to evaluate the performance of baseline approaches and a partial imputation algorithm when dealing with incomplete data.
