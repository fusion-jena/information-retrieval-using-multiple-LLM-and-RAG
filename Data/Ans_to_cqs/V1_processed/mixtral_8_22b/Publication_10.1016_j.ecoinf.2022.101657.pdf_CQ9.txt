The information provided does not explicitly mention the specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it mentions that the GBIF database contains over 2300 videos of animals, including a subset of 330 videos that were manually annotated for the purpose of tuning parameters and evaluating the system. Therefore, while it cannot be confirmed without additional information, there is a possibility that the deep learning pipeline might be accessible through the GBIF database.
