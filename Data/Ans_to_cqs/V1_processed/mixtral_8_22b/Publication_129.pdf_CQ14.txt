Unfortunately, there is no explicit mention of how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized in the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query. However, common methods for hyperparameter optimization include techniques like Grid Search, Random Search, Bayesian Optimization, etc. Without further details about the specific model used in this case, we cannot determine which method was utilized here.
