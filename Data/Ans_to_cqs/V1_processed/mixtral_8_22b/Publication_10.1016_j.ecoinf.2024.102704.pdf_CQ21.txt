The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific post-processing steps involved after the model training. However, based on common practices in machine learning, we can infer some possible post-processing steps.

After training the model with the targeted fish species dataset, which was divided into training and validation sets in an 8:2 ratio, it is likely that the model performance would be evaluated using various metrics. In this case, the text mentions two such metrics - Frames Per Second (FPS), which denotes the execution speed of the tracking algorithm, and memory usage, which evaluates the convenience of the model deployment. These metrics help assess the efficiency and practicality of the model.

Additionally, the optimization of detection accuracy and inference speed by the C1 module suggests that these aspects were also considered during or after the training phase. Detection accuracy could involve calculating metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score, while inference speed might require measuring the time taken for the model to generate predictions.

While the context does not explicitly mention confusion matrices or saliency maps, they are commonly used techniques in machine learning for understanding model behavior and improving interpretability. A confusion matrix helps visualize the performance of the classifier, showing true positives, false negatives, false positives, and true negatives. On the other hand, saliency maps highlight important features contributing to the model's decision-making process, providing insights into its inner workings.

In conclusion, although the exact post-processing steps are not specified in the given context, one can assume that evaluation metrics like FPS and memory usage, along with potential techniques like confusion matrices and saliency maps, may have been employed to analyze and improve the trained model.
