The text does not provide explicit information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models mentioned. However, it mentions that computation time was evaluated using an Intel i7-9700 CPU with an NVIDIA RTX2070 GPU. This suggests that the authors may have used this setup for their experiments, but it doesn't confirm whether they exclusively used these resources or if other hardware components were involved during the training process. Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot definitively state which hardware resources were used for training the deep learning models.
