The given context does not provide information on the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, generally speaking, there are several ways to collect raw data for use in machine learning or deep learning pipelines. These include:

1. Surveys: Data can be collected through surveys, which involve asking individuals questions about their behaviors, attitudes, opinions, etc. This method is often used when researchers want to gather qualitative data.

2. Sensors: Sensors can be used to collect data automatically. For example, wearable devices like fitness trackers can collect data on physical activity levels, heart rate, sleep patterns, etc. Similarly, environmental sensors can collect data on air quality, temperature, humidity, etc.

3. Public Datasets: There are many publicly available datasets that researchers can use for their projects. These datasets may have been collected by government agencies, research institutions, or private companies. Examples include weather data, census data, satellite imagery, etc.

In summary, while the given context does not provide specific details on how raw data was collected for this particular study, common methods for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines include surveys, sensors, and public datasets.
