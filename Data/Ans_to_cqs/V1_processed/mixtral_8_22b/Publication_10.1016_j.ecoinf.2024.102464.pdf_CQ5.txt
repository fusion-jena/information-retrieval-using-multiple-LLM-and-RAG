The query asks about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, based on the given context, there is no information regarding the use of these specific datasets in the research process. Instead, the authors mention utilizing data from the third and fourth natural environment surveys, including various environmental variables, to assess the impact of urban development on species distribution. They also employ seven different machine learning models and extract Area Under the Curve (AUC) values before and after urban development. Therefore, it can be concluded that the mentioned datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet are not relevant to this particular research study.
