The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific dataset used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, there are references to some datasets used in the research. These include a survey on missing data in machine learning (Emmanuel et al., 2021) and various studies on forest fires and their environmental impacts (Földi & Kuti, 2016; Ganteaume et al., 2013). Additionally, there is a reference to a study on learning from imbalanced data (He & Garcia, 2009) and another on simulating forest fire fronts using cellular automata (Hernández Encinas et al., 2007a). It appears that the authors developed their own models and architectures based on these studies rather than relying on pre-existing datasets commonly used in deep learning pipelines.
