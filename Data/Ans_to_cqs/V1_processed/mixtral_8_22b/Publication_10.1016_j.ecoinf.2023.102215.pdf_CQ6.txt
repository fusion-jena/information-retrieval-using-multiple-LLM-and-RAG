The text does not provide explicit details about the specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it mentions that all training and test images are uniformly resized to 288 x 288 pixels. This step could be considered part of the preprocessing stage, ensuring consistent input dimensions for the model during both training and testing phases. Other common preprocessing techniques might have been applied, but they are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
