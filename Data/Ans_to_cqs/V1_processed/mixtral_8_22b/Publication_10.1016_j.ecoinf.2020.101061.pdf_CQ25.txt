The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given text is not explicitly stated; however, based on the context, it appears to be primarily focused on tree detection. More specifically, the goal seems to be creating a universal tree detection algorithm capable of accurately identifying trees across various forest types. This is supported by statements such as "finding general features will require...algorithmic approaches that allow the neural networks to learn the combination of features that characterize trees across forest types" and "We find that the deep learning approach works well for overstory tree detection across forest conditions." Therefore, while the exact type of deep learning model isn't specified, its primary function appears to be object detection, specifically aimed at detecting tree crowns in remote sensing images.
