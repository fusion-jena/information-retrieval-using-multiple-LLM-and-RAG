The training process is determined to be complete based on the early stopping strategy by inspecting validation accuracy. This means that even though the maximum number of epochs for training was set to 100, the training could finish earlier if the validation accuracy reached a satisfactory level. Additionally, the learning rate was adjusted during training by monitoring the validation loss after every epoch.
