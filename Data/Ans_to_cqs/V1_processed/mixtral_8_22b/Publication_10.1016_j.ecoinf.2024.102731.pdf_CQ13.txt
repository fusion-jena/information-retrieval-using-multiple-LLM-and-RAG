The given context does not provide information about any specific deep learning models or their respective hyperparameters such as learning rates or optimizers. The references provided discuss topics like empty urbanism, bound constrained optimization, habitat factors related to wildlife conservation, and a habitat suitability model for European wild rabbits. None of them mention details regarding deep learning models or their hyperparameters. Therefore, based on the provided context, it is impossible to determine what hyperparameters were used in any potential deep learning models.
