The authors do not explicitly mention any specific data annotation techniques used in their deep learning pipeline. However, they discuss using a pre-trained algorithm to classify images based on predefined classes such as the presence of buildings, people, or birds. They also mention evaluating the performance of their red kite model based on an independent test set of 2060 images, out of which 950 were true positive red kite images. From this information, we can infer that some form of object detection or classification annotations might have been employed during the development of their deep learning models. Nevertheless, without explicit details about the annotation process, it remains uncertain what exact techniques were utilized.
