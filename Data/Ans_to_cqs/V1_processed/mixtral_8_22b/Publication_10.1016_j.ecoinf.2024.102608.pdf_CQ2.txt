The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in various applications, including speech recognition, image recognition, and natural language processing. These applications suggest that the data formats used could include images, audio files, text data, or other relevant formats depending on the specific application. Additionally, the study focuses on advancing reservoirs water quality parameters estimation using Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 satellite data, which implies the use of remote sensing data. Therefore, the data formats used in this particular case might include satellite imagery or geospatial data.
