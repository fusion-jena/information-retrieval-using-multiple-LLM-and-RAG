The text does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. It only mentions that the deep learning model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and provides some general information about CNNs. To find out the exact hyperparameters used in this particular deep learning model, additional resources would need to be consulted.
