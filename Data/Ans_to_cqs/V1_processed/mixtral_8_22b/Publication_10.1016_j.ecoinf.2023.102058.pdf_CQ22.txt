To evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, several metrics are used. In this case, the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient (LCCC), and bias are employed. These metrics help assess the model's performance during calibration, validation, and testing steps.

The coefficient of determination (R2) measures how well the predicted values fit the actual values. It ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect fit between the predicted and actual values.

Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is another metric used to measure the difference between the predicted and actual values. Lower RMSE values indicate better predictions.

Lin’s Concordance Correlation Coefficient (LCCC) evaluates the agreement between two variables by measuring their relationship and correspondence. An LCCC value close to 1 suggests strong agreement between the predicted and actual values.

Bias is a measure of systematic error or deviation from the true value. It helps identify any consistent overpredictions or underpredictions made by the model.

These four metrics provide valuable insights into the performance of the deep learning model when applied to hyperspectral data for predicting water quality parameters.
