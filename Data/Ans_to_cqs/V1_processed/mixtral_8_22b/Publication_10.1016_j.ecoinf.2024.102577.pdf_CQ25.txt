The provided context does not explicitly state the purpose of the deep learning model used in this study. However, we can infer from the keywords listed ("Sustainable fishing", "Bycatch", "Machine-learning", "Tropical tuna", "Fisheries oceanography", "Species distribution models") that the deep learning model might be used for predicting species distributions or habitat suitability for tropical tuna species. This could aid in understanding their migration patterns and inform sustainable fishing practices. The reference to Watson (2018) suggests that fuel efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions are also important considerations in this study.
