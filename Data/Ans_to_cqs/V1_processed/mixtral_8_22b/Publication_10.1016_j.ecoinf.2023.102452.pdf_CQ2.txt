The papers cited do not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in their respective deep learning pipelines. However, based on the nature of the research topics, it can be inferred that various types of data formats were likely utilized. For instance, in the paper by Dehghani et al. (2023), which focuses on streamflow forecasting, time series data is expected to have been employed, possibly in a format such as CSV or similar structured data. Similarly, in the study by Feng et al. (2017) concerning wind forecasting, meteorological data would have been required, potentially including both numerical and categorical variables stored in formats like CSV or JSON. Furthermore, considering the work by Uncuoglu et al. (2022) comparing different machine learning methods for solving civil engineering problems, diverse datasets could have been involved, ranging from tabular data (CSV, Excel) to spatial data (GeoTIFF, Shapefile). Lastly, given the focus on hydrological predictions in some studies, satellite imagery or remote sensing data might also have been incorporated into the deep learning pipelines, typically available in formats such as GeoTIFF or NetCDF. Nonetheless, without explicit information regarding the exact data formats used in each case, these assumptions remain speculative.
