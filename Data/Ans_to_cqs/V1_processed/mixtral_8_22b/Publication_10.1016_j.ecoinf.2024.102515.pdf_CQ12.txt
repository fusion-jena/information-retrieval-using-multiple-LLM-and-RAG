Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. The context primarily discusses the challenges faced while extracting biodiversity observations from Twitter data due to the nature of tweets, such as low word count, poor grammar, and lack of location information. It also mentions the use of the 'Full-archive search endpoint' to access Twitter data and the use of the twarc2 library to handle the returned data in JSON format. However, without further context or details regarding the specific deep learning models employed in the pipeline, it is impossible to determine the exact type of deep learning model used.
