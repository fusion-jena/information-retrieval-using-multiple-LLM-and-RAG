In the given context, it appears that the raw data for the deep learning pipeline is collected using various types of sensors and stations. Specifically, soil moisture probes, radiation stations, and eddy covariance stations are mentioned as sources of data collection. These sensors and stations likely collect data on various environmental factors such as soil moisture, pressure, precipitation, air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, global radiation, reflected radiation, atmospheric radiation, emitted radiation, sensible heat flux, latent heat flux, carbon dioxide flux, etc. It is not explicitly stated whether any survey or public datasets were also used for data collection. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the primary method of data collection for this particular study involves the use of specialized sensors and stations.
