The strategy employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the random seed value, is to average the performance over multiple random seeds. This approach helps mitigate the impact of random initialization and stochastic processes inherent in training deep learning models. In this case, the performance is averaged over 10 different random seeds.
