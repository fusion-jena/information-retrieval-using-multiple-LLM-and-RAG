Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved. These may include data cleaning, where missing values are handled, outliers are removed, and inconsistent data is corrected. Normalization and scaling are also common preprocessing steps, especially when dealing with features of varying scales. In this case, the MinMaxScaler technique was used, which is particularly important for algorithms like Support Vector Regressors (SVR) and neural networks that are sensitive to the scale of the data. Another preprocessing step mentioned is the transformation of categorical fields into numerical values using the LabelEncoder. This is necessary because agricultural datasets often contain categorical data, such as soil types or crop varieties, which need to be converted into numerical labels before they can be inputted into machine learning algorithms.
