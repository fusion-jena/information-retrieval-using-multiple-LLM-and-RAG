Unfortunately, the given context does not provide explicit information about the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, we can infer that some form of optimization technique was employed due to the mention of fine-tuning a convolutional neural network (CNN) and achieving high classification rates. Fine-tuning typically involves adjusting model parameters through backpropagation and gradient descent algorithms like SGD or Adam. Additionally, the use of regularized cross entropy as a loss function suggests that optimization techniques were utilized during the training process. Nevertheless, without further details regarding the exact optimization method used, we cannot definitively state which one was implemented in the deep learning pipeline.
