To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures have been implemented. Firstly, Local Response Normalization (LRN) was employed after the pooling operation. The LRN enhances larger response values while reducing smaller ones, thereby improving the model's generalization capabilities. Secondly, a dropout layer was incorporated in the tenth layer of the network. Dropout is a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting during training by randomly dropping out units along with their connections. Lastly, the use of diverse datasets and cross-validation techniques could further enhance the model's ability to generalize well on unseen data. However, specific details regarding these aspects are not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
