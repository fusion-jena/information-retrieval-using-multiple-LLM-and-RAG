Unfortunately, there isn't any specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context. However, some common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and landmark annotation. These techniques help label datasets for tasks like object detection, image segmentation, pose estimation, etc.
