The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the given context is to identify the degree of damage caused by Emerald Ash Borer (EAB) to forest trees in different months (June, August, and September) within the study area. This model uses a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) algorithm to achieve this objective. The performance of the model is evaluated through metrics such as overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient, which indicate how accurately the model can distinguish between damaged and undamaged forest areas. In summary, the primary goal of this deep learning model is to provide accurate information about the extent of EAB infestations in forests, enabling better management strategies and conservation efforts.
