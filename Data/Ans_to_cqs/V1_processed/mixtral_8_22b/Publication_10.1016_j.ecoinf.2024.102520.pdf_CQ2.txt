Based on the given context, it can be inferred that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is satellite imagery. Specifically, the study utilizes Landsat 8 OLI and TIRS bands of 30-meter resolution and remote sensing image data from Google Earth Engine (GEE). These datasets are processed through geometric, radiometric, and image mosaicking techniques before being fed into the deep learning model. Additionally, topographic variables such as slope, aspect, drainage, and parent material are derived from DEM using SAGA GIS. Therefore, it appears that the main data formats utilized in this study are raster-based geospatial data, including both multispectral satellite imagery and digital elevation models.
