Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of how the data was split for deep learning model training into sets such as train, test, and validation. However, it can be inferred that some form of cross-validation or holdout method might have been employed due to the presence of hyperparameter tuning and selection of the best model based on performance metrics. In general, common practices involve dividing the dataset into three parts: training, testing, and validation sets. The training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set helps tune the parameters and prevent overfitting. Lastly, the test set evaluates the final model's performance.
