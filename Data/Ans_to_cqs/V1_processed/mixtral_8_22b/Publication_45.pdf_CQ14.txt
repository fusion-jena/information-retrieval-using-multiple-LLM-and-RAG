Based on the given information, it appears that the hyperparameters of the model were optimized through an iterative evaluation process. This means that different combinations of hyperparameters were tested repeatedly until the best combination was found. However, the specific methods used for this optimization, such as grid search or random search, are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. Therefore, while we can infer that some form of iterative optimization was employed, the exact method remains unspecified.
