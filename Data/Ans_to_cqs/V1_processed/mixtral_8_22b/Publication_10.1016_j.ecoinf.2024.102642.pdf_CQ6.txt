The text does not provide explicit information about specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning before training the deep learning model. However, there are some related aspects mentioned.

Firstly, the text discusses addressing the challenge of annotation discrepancies between novices and experts. This suggests that the raw dataset may have gone through some form of initial processing or filtering to create these annotations.

Secondly, the text mentions maintaining consistent hyperparameters across all training instances for each task. Hyperparameters are parameters whose values are set prior to the commencement of the learning process. Although this doesn't directly refer to preprocessing steps like normalization or scaling, it indicates that certain preparatory decisions were made to standardize the training conditions.

Lastly, the text refers to the use of an early stopping method to prevent overfitting during model training. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the detail and noise in the training data to the extent that it negatively impacts its performance on new data. Thus, employing techniques to avoid overfitting can be considered part of the broader preparation process before training a deep learning model.
