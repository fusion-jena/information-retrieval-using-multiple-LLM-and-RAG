The paper does not explicitly mention any specific criteria for determining when training is complete. However, it discusses various parameters that were adjusted during model training, including the number of training epochs, batch size, volume size, and regularization strength. These parameters could potentially influence the decision regarding when to stop training. For instance, one might decide to stop training after reaching a certain number of epochs or once the performance on a validation dataset stops improving. Nevertheless, without explicit information about stopping criteria, it cannot be definitively stated how the authors determined when training was complete.
