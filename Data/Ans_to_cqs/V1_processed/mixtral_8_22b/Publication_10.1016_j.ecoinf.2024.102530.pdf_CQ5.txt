The datasets used in this study include the Land Use / Land Cover Map (LULC), MNT-Lidar, Weather data, Database of parcels and declared agricultural production (BDPPAD), Geobase of the Quebec hydrographic network (GRHQ), and Geobase Addresses Quebec. The LULC dataset has a temporal resolution of annual and a spatial resolution of 10m, while the MNT-Lidar dataset has a spatial resolution of 1m. The Weather data has a temporal resolution of daily and a spatial resolution of 2.5km. All three datasets are in raster format. The remaining datasets are vector formats. The sources for each dataset are listed in Table 1. However, it should be noted that none of these datasets are typically used in deep learning pipelines such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, they are used for environmental studies and modeling.
