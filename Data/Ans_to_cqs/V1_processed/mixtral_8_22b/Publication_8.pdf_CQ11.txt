The given context does not provide any direct reference to the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in this research article. However, it mentions that the authors are associated with various institutions including the Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre (SBiK-F), the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at Philipps-University Marburg, and the Senckenberg Research Institute and Natural History Museum. It also lists several contributors to the paper, including Marco Schmidt, who works at Palmengartenâ€™s scientific service and curates living collections and collection databases. Given this information, one could potentially search for relevant repositories linked to these individuals or institutions to find the desired data repository link. Unfortunately, without more specific details about the dataset or code used in the deep learning pipeline, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based solely on the given context.
