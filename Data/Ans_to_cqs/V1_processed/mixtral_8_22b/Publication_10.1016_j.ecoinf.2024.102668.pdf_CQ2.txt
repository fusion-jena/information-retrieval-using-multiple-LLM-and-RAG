The given context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the information provided that the study involves audio recordings. The text mentions two types of devices, SongMeter and AudioMoth, both of which are known to be audio recording devices. Furthermore, the context refers to sampling schemes, frequency sampling rates (FS), gain settings, and references to articles related to audio signal processing and detection of songbirds using audio recordings. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the data format used in this deep learning pipeline is audio.
