In the described study, four different datasets were created from a raw training dataset containing 20 fish species. These datasets aimed to evaluate the influence of dataset construction on classification results. The first dataset, T1, consisted of raw fish thumbnails and their corresponding mirror images. Specifically, the number of thumbnails per fish individual was doubled by flipping each thumbnail along the vertical axis. This process ensured equal proportions of left-oriented and right-oriented individuals in the database, hypothesized to enhance the overall identification rate since fish can be observed in various orientations. However, the specific names of the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, were not mentioned in the provided context.
