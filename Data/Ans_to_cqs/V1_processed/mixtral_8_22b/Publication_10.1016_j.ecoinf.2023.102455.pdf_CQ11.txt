Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to determine the exact data repository link of the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context. It would be necessary to have more specific details about the research or authors involved to locate this information. However, it can be suggested that one could search for the relevant publications on platforms such as Google Scholar, ResearchGate, or other academic databases, and then look for any links to datasets within those papers or their supplementary materials. Alternatively, contacting the corresponding author(s) directly might also yield the desired information.
