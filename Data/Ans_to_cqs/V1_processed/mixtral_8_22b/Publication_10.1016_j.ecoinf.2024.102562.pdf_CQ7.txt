Based on the given context, the data was split into training and validation sets for deep learning model training. However, the specific criteria used to split the data are not explicitly mentioned. Nevertheless, we can infer that the data was divided based on the location of the samples, i.e., Greenland, Sweden, and Kenya. This division allowed the researchers to evaluate the model's ability to capture and quantify differences in bacterial abundance and morphology across different environments. Additionally, the text mentions that a smaller dataset containing only Kenyan images was used to fine-tune the model for low-quality images. Therefore, it appears that the data splitting strategy considered both geographical factors and image quality.
