Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention that the training period lasts for four weeks in Experiment 1 and nine months in Experiment 3. It also mentions that the training sets consist of data collected over these timeframes. Therefore, it seems that the duration of the training period might serve as a criterion for determining when training is complete. Additionally, the context discusses various metrics like RMSE, MAE, MRE, and accuracy, but it doesn't explicitly state whether they were used to decide when training should stop.
