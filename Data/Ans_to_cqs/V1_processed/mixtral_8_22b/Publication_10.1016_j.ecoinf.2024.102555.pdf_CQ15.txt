The paper titled "Verification of novel integrations of swarm intelligence algorithms into deep learning neural network for flood susceptibility mapping" discusses the integration of swarm intelligence algorithms into deep learning models. However, it does not explicitly mention any specific optimization technique such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). Therefore, based solely on this information, we cannot determine which optimization techniques were used in their deep learning pipeline. The other papers mentioned do not focus on deep learning pipelines either, so they also do not provide relevant information regarding optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines.
