To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, various measures were taken. Firstly, diverse datasets were employed for training and testing purposes. For instance, the URPC datasets containing four object categories - holothurian, echinus, scallop, and starfish - were used for experimentation. Additionally, five more datasets, namely Aquarium, Trash-ICRA19, VisDrone, NWPU VHR-10, and HRSID, were also included for evaluating the model's generalization capabilities.

Secondly, the experimental data was divided into training and test sets following an 8:2 ratio. Specifically, the training process of YWnet utilized a dataset consisting of 956 images, while a separate test set of 244 images was used to assess the model's ability to perform well on unseen data. This division of data into training and test sets allowed for a comprehensive evaluation of the algorithm's performance.

Lastly, data augmentation techniques such as rotation, scaling, flipping, brightness adjustment, contrast adjustment, saturation adjustment, hue adjustment, Gaussian blurring, and median blurring were applied to enhance the diversity of the training dataset. By introducing variations in the training data, these augmentations enabled the model to learn robust features and improve its performance in real-world scenarios.
