The provided context does not directly address the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, generally speaking, these are common preprocessing steps often used when preparing data for deep learning models. Normalization typically involves rescaling numeric variables to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. Scaling can involve techniques like min-max scaling where values are shifted and rescaled so that they fall within a specified range, usually between 0 and 1. Cleaning data may include handling missing values, removing outliers, or correcting inconsistent data entries. These steps help ensure that the input data is suitable for the deep learning algorithm and can contribute to better performance and more accurate predictions.
