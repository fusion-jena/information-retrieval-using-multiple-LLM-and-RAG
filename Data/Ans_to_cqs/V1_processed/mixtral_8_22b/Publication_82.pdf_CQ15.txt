Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention any specific optimization techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam that are commonly used in deep learning pipelines. However, some hyperparameters related to optimization are mentioned, including momentum, weight decay, gamma, batch size, and number of epochs. These hyperparameters are often used in conjunction with optimization algorithms like SGD or Adam.

Momentum is a technique used to accelerate gradient descent by adding a fraction of the update vector of the past time step to the current one. This helps to dampen oscillations and speed up convergence. In this context, the momentum value is set to 0.9.

Weight decay, also known as L2 regularization, is another common technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. Here, the weight decay value is set to 0.0005.

Gamma is a parameter used in learning rate schedules, where the learning rate is reduced after certain intervals during training. It is typically used to improve generalization and avoid local minima. In this context, the gamma value is set to 0.1.

Batch size refers to the number of samples processed before updating the internal model parameters. A larger batch size may lead to more stable updates but requires more memory, while a smaller batch size may result in noisier updates but allows for faster iterations. Here, the batch sizes are set to 24 for GoogLeNet and 100 for AlexNet.

Finally, the number of epochs determines how many times the entire dataset is passed through the network during training. More epochs generally mean better performance but also increase the risk of overfitting. In this context, the number of epochs is not explicitly stated, but it is implied that different numbers of epochs were used for each configuration (e.g., 30/3 epochs).

In conclusion, although the exact optimization algorithm is not specified, several hyperparameters related to optimization are mentioned, suggesting that some form of optimization technique was employed in the deep learning pipeline.
