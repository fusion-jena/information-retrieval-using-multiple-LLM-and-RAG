In the given context, it appears that a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is being used in the pipeline. This is evident from several references made throughout the text. Firstly, the paper titled "A deep convolutional neural network for background subtraction" by Babaee et al. (2017) suggests that a CNN is employed for image processing tasks related to motion detection and object recognition. Secondly, the mention of "inception layers," which are commonly associated with CNN architectures like GoogLeNet, further supports the use of a CNN. Lastly, the reference to extracting feature vectors from images also aligns with typical CNN pipelines where features are extracted from input data before passing them through fully connected layers for final predictions. Therefore, based on these observations, we can conclude that a deep convolutional neural network is utilized in the described pipeline.
