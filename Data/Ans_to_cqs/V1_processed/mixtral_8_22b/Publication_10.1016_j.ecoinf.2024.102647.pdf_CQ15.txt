Unfortunately, there is no information available regarding the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline within the given context. Therefore, it cannot be determined which optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) were applied.
