Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that the trained model is hosted using TensorFlow 2.2 and served through a public-facing website developed by the authors. However, it does not specify any links or repositories containing the source code of the pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
