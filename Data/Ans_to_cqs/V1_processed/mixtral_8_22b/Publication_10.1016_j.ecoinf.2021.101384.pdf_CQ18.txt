The text does not explicitly mention any specific strategies implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, based on the given context, we can infer that the authors might have used techniques such as cross-validation, early stopping, or monitoring metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., depending on their chosen machine learning algorithms. Additionally, since the authors discuss using large input datasets and dealing with issues related to data quality and completeness, they may have employed techniques like data augmentation, regularization, or dropout to prevent overfitting and improve model performance. Nevertheless, without explicit details about the model architecture, training procedure, and evaluation criteria, it remains speculative.
