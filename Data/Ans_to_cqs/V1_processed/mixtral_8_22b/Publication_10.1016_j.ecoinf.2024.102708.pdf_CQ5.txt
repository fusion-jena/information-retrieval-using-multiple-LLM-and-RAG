The deep learning pipeline utilized two primary datasets for pretraining the models. The TPH-YOLOv5 model was pre-trained using the VisDrone dataset, while the YOLOv5m, YOLOv5s, and FR-CNN models were pre-trained on the COCO dataset. These datasets were leveraged to take advantage of transfer learning capabilities.
