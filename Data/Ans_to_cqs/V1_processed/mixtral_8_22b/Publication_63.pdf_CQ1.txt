The authors utilize a combination of professional and citizen science data sources for collecting raw data in their deep learning pipeline. Specifically, they use the iNaturalist plant photograph database, which provides a worldwide coverage of plant images. Additionally, they mention the use of bioclimatic data, although it is not explicitly stated where this data comes from. It appears that the authors do not rely solely on traditional survey or sensor data collection methods, instead opting for publicly available datasets and crowdsourcing initiatives like iNaturalist.
