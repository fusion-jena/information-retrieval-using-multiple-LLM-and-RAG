The given context does not provide explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer based on the given context. However, generally speaking, postprocessing steps can vary depending on the type of deep learning task and the desired outcome. For example, in object detection tasks, non-maximum suppression might be used to eliminate redundant bounding boxes. In classification tasks, calculating accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves, etc., could be part of the postprocessing steps. Visualizations like saliency maps or heatmaps may also be generated to understand which parts of the input contributed most to the prediction. Ultimately, the choice of postprocessing steps depends on the requirements and goals of the project.
