Based on the given context, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images. Specifically, the study uses input patch sizes of 256 x 256 pixels, indicating that the data format is indeed images. Furthermore, the use of TensorFlow, a popular deep learning library known for processing images, also supports this conclusion. However, there is no mention of any other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV files being used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, we can conclude that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images.
