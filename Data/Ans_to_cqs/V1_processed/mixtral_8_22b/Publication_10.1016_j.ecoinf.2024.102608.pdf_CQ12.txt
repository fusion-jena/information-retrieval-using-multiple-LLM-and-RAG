Based on the given information, it appears that the study uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) as part of its machine learning pipeline. However, it should be noted that while ANNs are often associated with deep learning, they do not explicitly specify which type of deep learning model is being used, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or Transformers. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, we cannot definitively determine the specific type of deep learning model used in this case.
