In this study, several data augmentation techniques were applied using the Keras image_data_generator function. These techniques include rotation within a range of 0-40 degrees, width and height shifts with a range of 20%, shearing transformation with a range of 0-0.2 radians, zooming with a range of 0-0.2 scalar values, horizontal flipping, and filling missing pixels with the nearest neighbor value. These techniques help improve the robustness and generalization capabilities of the model by artificially increasing the size of the dataset and introducing variations into it.
