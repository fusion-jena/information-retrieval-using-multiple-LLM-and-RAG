Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, some relevant information regarding avoiding overfitting and underfitting situations, preventing over-training and biased training, and adopting a restrictive and gradually increasing training cycle and accuracy calculation approach based on mean square error (MSE) can be found. This suggests that the authors have taken measures to ensure the quality and fairness of their models, but they do not explicitly discuss the use of common techniques like stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.
