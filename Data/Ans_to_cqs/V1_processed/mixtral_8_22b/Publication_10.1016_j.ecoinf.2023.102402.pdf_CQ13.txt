Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available in the given context to determine the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. The text discusses the use of Maxent models for establishing species distributions but does not provide details on any deep learning techniques or their associated hyperparameters such as learning rates or optimizers. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based solely on this context.
