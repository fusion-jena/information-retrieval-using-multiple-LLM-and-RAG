The text does not explicitly mention which specific evaluation metrics were used to assess the performance of the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that the optimal classification accuracy was obtained when the test set size was smallest relative to the training set. Additionally, the final classification model achieved 100% accuracy in predicting the correct identities of 44 captive Amur tigers. Therefore, based on this information, we can infer that one of the evaluation metrics used to measure the performance of the deep learning model was accuracy. Other common evaluation metrics for deep learning models include precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the curve (AUC), but these are not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
