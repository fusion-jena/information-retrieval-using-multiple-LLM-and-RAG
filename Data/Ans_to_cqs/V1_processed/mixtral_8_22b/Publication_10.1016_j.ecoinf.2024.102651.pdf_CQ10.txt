Based on the provided context, we can discuss some aspects of the deep learning models used for object classification. The text mentions two types of neural networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Vision Transformers (ViT), along with a hybrid model called CA-Hybrid network.

CNNs are known for their strong ability to extract local information from images due to their convolution operations. One popular architecture using CNNs is ResNet, which employs a residual structure connecting different network layers through shortcuts. This design helps preserve input features and address problems like gradient vanishing or explosion in deep networks. As a result, it improves feature learning and overall classification performance.

On the other hand, ViTs use self-attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies between image patches. They can extract richer semantic features compared to traditional CNNs. However, they may struggle with capturing fine-grained details due to their focus on global relationships.

A hybrid approach combining both CNNs and ViTs was proposed for Cervidae classification, named the CA-Hybrid network. This model integrates Class Activation Maps (CAM) into the residual structure of ResNet. By leveraging the strengths of both architectures, the CA-Hybrid network aims to improve classification accuracy by focusing on relevant regions within the input images while still considering global context.
