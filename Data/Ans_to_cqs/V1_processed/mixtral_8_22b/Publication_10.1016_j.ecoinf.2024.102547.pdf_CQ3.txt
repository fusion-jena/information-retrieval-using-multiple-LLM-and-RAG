The provided context does not contain specific details about data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it discusses the analysis of a multifrequency acoustics dataset from West African waters, focusing on exploring the spatial arrangement of marine organism aggregations. Various attributes like thickness, relative density, and depth were examined in relation to their surroundings. The study employs both fisheries acoustics techniques and functional data analysis (FDA). FDA is a statistical approach for stochastic processes primarily valued in a Hilbert space. It has gained significant attention from the scientific community due to its ability to handle diverse and heterogeneous datasets. Some examples of FDA applications include examining particle-size distributions in sedimentary environments, predicting total suspended solids concentration in coastal zones, classifying seabeds in coastal environments, and studying high-frequency physical, biological, and behavioral data from electronic recorders deployed on marine predators. In summary, while the context does not directly address data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines, it provides insights into the application of fisheries acoustics techniques and FDA in analyzing marine ecosystems.
