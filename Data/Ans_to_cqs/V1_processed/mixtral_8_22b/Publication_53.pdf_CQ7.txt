The authors utilized an 80-20% split for training and validation datasets, respectively. They did not explicitly mention a separate test dataset. This means that they divided their labeled data into two parts - 80% for training the model and 20% for validating its performance during the training process. This is a common practice in machine learning to ensure that the model does not overfit to the training data and can generalize well to new, unseen data. However, it would have been beneficial if they had mentioned a separate test dataset to evaluate the final performance of the model after the training and fine-tuning processes.
