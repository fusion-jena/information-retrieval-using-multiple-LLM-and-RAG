To ensure the generalizability of their deep learning models, R. Noda et al. employed several strategies. Firstly, they utilized diverse datasets by selecting features using two different Cross-Validation (CV) processes - 'random-CV' and'spatial-CV'. These feature sets were derived from a previous study conducted by Mechenich et al. (2024). Secondly, they performed testing with both raw and scaled versions of features, resulting in four feature sets per model type. Lastly, they applied various machine learning techniques such as logistic regression and Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) with different settings and prior distributions. However, it should be noted that the paper does not explicitly mention specific methods like stratified splitting or k-fold cross-validation.
