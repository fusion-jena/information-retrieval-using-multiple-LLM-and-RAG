The article does not provide specific information about the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) are an important approach for handling and analyzing big data, including geolocation-based services. This suggests that the authors may have collected raw data using location-based sensors or other sources such as satellite imagery or remote sensing data. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of unsupervised learning algorithms like GRELMA for clustering, indicating that the authors likely had access to large amounts of unlabeled data. Without more specific details from the article, it is difficult to definitively state what methods were used for collecting raw data.
