Unfortunately, based on the given context, there isn't enough information to provide a detailed answer about how the trained deep learning model was deployed. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and functionality of the Underwater Object Detection Network (UODN), specifically discussing its backbone network, which includes the Concatenate Module (CM). It also mentions the use of the YOLOv8 network for feature extraction but highlights the limitations of using the C2f module due to the split operation that results in losing half of the feature information. To address this issue, the authors propose their own CM, which combines both halves of the feature information without any loss.

However, regarding the deployment of the trained deep learning model, no specific details are mentioned in the provided context. Typically, once a deep learning model has been trained, it can be saved or serialized for later use. This involves saving the model's weights and architecture so that it can be loaded and used for predictions. Additionally, when deploying a deep learning model, one might consider factors like platform selection (e.g., cloud-based vs edge computing), hardware requirements, latency, scalability, etc. But again, without further context, I cannot provide specific details about how the trained deep learning model was deployed.
