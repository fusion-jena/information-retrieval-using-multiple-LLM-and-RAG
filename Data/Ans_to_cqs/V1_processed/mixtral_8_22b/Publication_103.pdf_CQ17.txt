The papers referenced in the given context do not explicitly mention specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, they discuss techniques related to preventing overfitting in deep learning models. For instance, Vanhoucke and Rabinovich (2015) present a paper about going deeper with convolutions, which could potentially help avoid overfitting by increasing the complexity of the model. Similarly, Ioffe and Szegedy (2015) introduce batch normalization, a technique that can improve training speed and reduce generalization error. Additionally, He et al. (2015) delve into rectified activation functions, which may also contribute to better convergence and reduced overfitting. Although none of these directly address regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization, they provide insights into strategies for improving deep learning pipelines and mitigating overfitting.
