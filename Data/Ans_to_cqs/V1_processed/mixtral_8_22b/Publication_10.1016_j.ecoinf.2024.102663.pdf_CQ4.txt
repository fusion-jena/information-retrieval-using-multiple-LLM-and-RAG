The given context does not explicitly mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, scaling, etc. However, it discusses the potential benefits of incorporating deep learning techniques into pre-processing under challenging conditions, such as low light, extreme occlusion, or overlapping of fish. It also mentions the possibility of enhancing the detection and classification of fish species within the dataset by utilizing Bidirectional LSTM with GloVe embeddings. Furthermore, the text suggests modifying the architecture of deep learning models like YOLO to better suit specific requirements, including handling different environmental factors affecting fish biomass. Nevertheless, based solely on the provided context, I cannot determine the exact data augmentation techniques employed in the deep learning pipeline.
