Based on the given context, there isn't any direct information regarding the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, some insights can still be derived from the text.

The process discussed in the context involves redescription mining, which combines partitioning techniques like clustering with modeling techniques like regression. Redescription mining focuses on identifying multiple local models within subsets of data and generating sets of limiting conditions along with corresponding splits of the data.

This approach differs from traditional analysis methods that aim to find global models without providing explicit and interpretable limiting conditions. Therefore, one could infer that the splitting of data might depend on these generated limiting conditions and the resulting local patterns found through redescription mining.

Additionally, the context mentions certain constraints applied during the runs, such as requiring at least 1% of localities satisfying both queries and at least 30% of localities satisfying neither of the queries. These constraints may also play a role in determining how the data gets divided into different subsets for training purposes.

However, since no clear mention of specific criteria for splitting data into train, test, and validation sets was made, it cannot be definitively stated what those exact criteria are based solely on the provided context.
