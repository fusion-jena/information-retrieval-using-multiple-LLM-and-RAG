The given context does not provide information about specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), or others. However, it mentions the use of machine learning techniques for classification tasks related to forest fires. These techniques could potentially involve various optimization methods depending on the chosen model architecture and training strategy. For instance, neural networks often employ gradient descent algorithms like SGD or Adam during backpropagation to minimize loss and update weights iteratively. Nonetheless, without explicit mention in the provided text, we cannot definitively state which optimization techniques are utilized in this case.
