Unfortunately, there is no information provided about how the hyperparameters of the BirdNET model were optimized. The given context only mentions that the model was trained using extensive data pre-processing, augmentation, and mixup, but it does not specify any details regarding the optimization process or techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this query based on the available information.
