In this study, various input datasets were used for classification purposes. These datasets included combinations of spectral bands such as green, red, red edge, and near-infrared (NIR). Additionally, several spectral indices like normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), visible NDVI (vNDVI), normalized difference red edge index (NDRE), digital surface model (DSM), and nine variations of the texture index called Run Percentage were employed. The texture index was calculated using three kernel and three offset options in all combinations.

These datasets were utilized in different combinations, as shown in Figure 2 and Table 2. Some examples include 'a', which represents spectral bands,'si' representing spectral indices, 't' for texture indices, and 'bsi' combining both bands and spectral indices. Furthermore, the recursive feature elimination (RFE) method was applied to determine the most important variables based on the largest overall accuracy. This process involved removing the weakest variable stepwise until only one variable remained. Two types of RFE were implemented: one for the seven-class model ('rfe') and another for the thirteen-class model ('tsi').

However, it should be noted that these datasets do not correspond to well-known deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, they consist of specific combinations of spectral bands, indices, and textures tailored for this particular research project.
