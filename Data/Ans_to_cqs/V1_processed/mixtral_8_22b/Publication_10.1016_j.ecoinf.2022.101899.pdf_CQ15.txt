In the research conducted by Halgamuge et al. (2020), they focused on utilizing deep learning to estimate the best optimizer selection methods for wildfire event predictions in Australia. Although the paper does not explicitly mention which specific optimization techniques were used in their deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that they analyzed six different optimizer models. These optimizers could include popular choices like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSprop), or others. Unfortunately, without access to the full text of the article, I cannot provide a definitive list of the exact optimization techniques employed in their deep learning pipeline.
