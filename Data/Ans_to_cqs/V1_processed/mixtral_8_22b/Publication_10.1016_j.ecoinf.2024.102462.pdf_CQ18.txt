The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves evaluating the deep learning (DL) network on an independent dataset not seen during training, known as the testing dataset. This allows for the assessment of the network's ability to generalize its learned patterns to unseen data. Additionally, confusion matrices are used to present the results of the training sets, providing insights into the model's performance across different classes. Data augmentation is also employed to increase the amount of training data available, which helps improve the model's robustness and generalization capabilities. However, care must be taken to avoid data leakage, where properties of the testing data inadvertently influence the training process, compromising the estimation of the network's generalization power.
