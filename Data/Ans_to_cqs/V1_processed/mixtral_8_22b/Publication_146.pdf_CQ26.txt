The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it does indicate that due to the lack of existing quality data, a new dataset was created specifically for the project. This could be seen as a form of addressing data bias by ensuring that the dataset used for training and testing is relevant and tailored to the specific task at hand. Additionally, the use of the Adam optimizer, which has been shown to perform well on smaller datasets, may also help mitigate potential biases introduced by limited data availability.
