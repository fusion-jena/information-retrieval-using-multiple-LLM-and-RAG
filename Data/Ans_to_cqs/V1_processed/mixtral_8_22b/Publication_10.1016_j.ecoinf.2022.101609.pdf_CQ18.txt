The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves creating a validation set and utilizing it to select the best performing model. The dataset is split into training, test, and validation sets. Training data is used for training the model, while validation data is employed to choose the most effective model after confirmation using the test data. In cases where there is a class imbalance, randomizing the dataset prior to splitting is recommended. However, since this particular problem resembles a time-series issue, stratification may not be necessary.
