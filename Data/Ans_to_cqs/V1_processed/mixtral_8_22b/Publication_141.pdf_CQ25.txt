The purpose of the deep learning model is for classification. The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier implemented in Python programming language using Keras and TensorFlow libraries. The model transforms input images into a 2048 feature vector that is subject to classification using a fully connected layer. The normalized exponential function (softmax) then determines the probability for each class. The model aims to classify chironomid taxa from images of their head capsules. The dataset was divided into 80% for training and 20% for validation, maintaining a balanced distribution across categories. The study compares its approach to other works that have applied deep learning neural networks to various animal taxa, highlighting the importance of selecting an appropriate network architecture and protocol for image acquisition. In this case, the authors chose a ResNet-50 network architecture combined with transfer learning, data augmentation, and dropout techniques.
