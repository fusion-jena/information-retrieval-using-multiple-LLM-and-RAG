The numerical evaluation of the deep learning model uses several metrics to assess its performance. These include overall accuracy (OA), kappa coefficient (KC), producer’s accuracy (PA), user’s accuracy (UA), commission error (CE), and omission error (OE). These metrics are reported in a confusion matrix format. They are defined based on the values of true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN). Specifically, the overall accuracy (OA) is calculated using Eq. (26), while the kappa coefficient (KC) is determined by Eq. (27). However, it should be noted that the specific equations were not included in the given context.
