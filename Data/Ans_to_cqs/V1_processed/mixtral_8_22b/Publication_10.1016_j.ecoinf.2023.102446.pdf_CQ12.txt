The given context does not provide any information about using a specific deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers in their methodology. Instead, it focuses on describing the use of Temporal Information Partitioning Network (TIPNet) for generating process networks based on mutual information (MI) decomposition and individual estimates of U, S, and R. Therefore, I cannot determine what type of deep learning model is used in this pipeline.
