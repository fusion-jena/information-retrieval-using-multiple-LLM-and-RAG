The text does not provide explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the study approaches the problem of detecting and counting NBSB through images and videos acquired with drones. Additionally, it states that they tested the model with a public image dataset of NBSB in soybean fields and added a novel one with more images. Therefore, it can be inferred that the researchers collected raw data using drones and utilized both publicly available datasets and their own custom dataset for training and testing purposes.
