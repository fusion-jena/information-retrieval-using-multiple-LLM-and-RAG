The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it does discuss the implementation details of the models and experimental results.

In terms of addressing potential data bias, the authors mentioned using a base learning rate of 10^-4 and applying weight decay to control the strength of the unit Gaussian prior. They also chose specific hyperparameters for the Adam optimizer. These choices might help mitigate certain types of bias but do not directly correspond to common preprocessing techniques like stratified splitting or resampling methods.

Additionally, the authors discussed the observation of low bias across a large portion of the range for their predictions, except for some under-estimation biases for height-related variables on high trees and over-estimation biases for low reference values concerning density estimates. While these observations indicate the presence of some bias in the dataset, they do not provide explicit information about how this bias was addressed during preprocessing.
