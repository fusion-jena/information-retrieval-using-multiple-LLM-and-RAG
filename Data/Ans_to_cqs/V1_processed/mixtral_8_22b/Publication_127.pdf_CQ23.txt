To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, a diverse dataset was used which consisted of both nonempty and empty images. Specifically, 25% (757,000) nonempty images and randomly selected 757,000 empty images were included in the dataset. This helped to prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data. Secondly, the dataset was split into training and test sets. Although it is not explicitly mentioned how the splitting was done, it is common practice to use techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting to ensure that the distribution of classes is similar between the training and test sets. These methods help to reduce bias and increase the reliability of the results. Overall, these measures aimed to create a robust and reliable deep learning model capable of accurately detecting images containing animals.
