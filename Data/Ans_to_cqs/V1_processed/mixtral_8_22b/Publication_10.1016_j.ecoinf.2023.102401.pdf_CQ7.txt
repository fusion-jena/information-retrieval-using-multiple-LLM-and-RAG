The context does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it mentions that the datasets were divided into training and testing sets. Typically, in machine learning and deep learning models, the data is often split into three subsets: training, validation, and testing.

The training set is used to fit the model, i.e., adjust the weights and biases of the network. The validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Lastly, the testing set is used to evaluate the final performance of the model after all tuning has been completed.

In this case, the context only explicitly mentions the division of data into training and testing sets. For example, the trash-ICRA19 dataset was divided into 915 images for training and 229 for testing. Similarly, the VisDrone dataset had 1288 images for training and 332 for testing. Other datasets mentioned also have their respective training and testing splits.

However, there is no mention of any validation set or how the splitting was done (randomly, stratified, etc.). Therefore, without additional context, it cannot be determined what specific criteria were used to split the data for deep learning model training.
