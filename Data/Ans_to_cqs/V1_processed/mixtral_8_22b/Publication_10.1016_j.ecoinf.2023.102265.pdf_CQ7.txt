The text does not explicitly state the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, or validation sets. However, it mentions that the authors used 5-fold cross-validation when training their Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. This implies that the dataset was divided into five equal parts or folds, where four folds were used for training and one fold was used for validation during each iteration. After all iterations, every sample would have been part of both the training set and the validation set exactly once. Additionally, the authors mention comparing the training times and validation accuracies of different ResNet architectures, which suggests that they also used separate validation datasets during this process.
