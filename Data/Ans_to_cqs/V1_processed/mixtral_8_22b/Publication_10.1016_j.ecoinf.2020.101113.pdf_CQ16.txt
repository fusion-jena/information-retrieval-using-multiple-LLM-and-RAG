Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, common practices in machine learning include monitoring metrics such as validation loss, accuracy, or other relevant measures during the training process. When these metrics reach a plateau or stop improving, it may indicate that further training will not yield significant improvements, suggesting that training could be considered complete. In some cases, early stopping mechanisms might be employed to halt training if no improvement is seen after a certain number of epochs. Nonetheless, without more specific details regarding the training procedure, it's impossible to provide a definitive answer based solely on the provided context.
