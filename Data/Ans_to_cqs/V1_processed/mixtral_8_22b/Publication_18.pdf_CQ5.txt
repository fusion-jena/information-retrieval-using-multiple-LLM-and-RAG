The text does not explicitly mention specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does discuss the use of a custom dataset containing 700 aerial images of whales for training a CNN model. This dataset was created specifically for the task of detecting whales in aerial images. Additionally, the text mentions that the construction of a dataset for training is often costly but can be improved through techniques like data augmentation and transfer learning.
