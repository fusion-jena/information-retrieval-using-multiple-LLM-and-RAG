The given context does not provide explicit details about specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) used in the deep learning pipeline. However, there are some implicit indications of optimization strategies employed within the described architecture.

For instance, the use of Batch Normalization (BatchNorm) suggests that this technique is being utilized to improve the speed, performance, and stability of the neural network during training. It helps reduce internal covariate shift, allowing each layer of the network to learn by itself a little more independently of other layers.

Additionally, the mention of SiLU activation function (also known as Swish) implies that this nonlinear function is chosen over others like ReLU due to its superior performance in certain tasks. The choice of activation functions can be considered part of optimizing the overall model performance.

Moreover, the introduction of Res2Net modules and group convolution indicates architectural modifications aimed at improving feature extraction capabilities, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the deep learning model. These modifications could also be seen as forms of optimization, albeit on a structural rather than mathematical level.

However, without direct reference to traditional optimization algorithms like SGD, Adam, RMSprop etc., it cannot be definitively stated what exact optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline based solely on the provided context.
