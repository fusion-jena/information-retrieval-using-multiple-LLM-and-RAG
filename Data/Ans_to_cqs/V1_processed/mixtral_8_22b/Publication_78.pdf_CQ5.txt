The paper does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in their deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the authors have used three different datasets based on the performance tables presented in Tables 2 and 4. These datasets are referred to as the first dataset and the third dataset (Bleached, Healthy, and Dead (BHD) Dataset), respectively. Unfortunately, there is no information available about the second dataset. It should also be noted that the paper does not provide any details regarding the size or nature of these datasets. Therefore, it cannot be confirmed if any standard datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet were used in the study.
