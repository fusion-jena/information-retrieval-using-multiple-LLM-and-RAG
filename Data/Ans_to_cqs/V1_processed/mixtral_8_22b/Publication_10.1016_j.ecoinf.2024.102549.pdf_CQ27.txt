Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available from the given context to provide a detailed explanation about how the trained deep learning model was deployed. However, it can be inferred that after training the model using the specified parameters and settings, the most effective model weights were selected for each cycle. This suggests that some form of model evaluation and validation might have been performed during the training phase. Nevertheless, details regarding the deployment process such as model serialization, platform selection, or any other specific steps taken to put the model into production are not mentioned in the provided text.
