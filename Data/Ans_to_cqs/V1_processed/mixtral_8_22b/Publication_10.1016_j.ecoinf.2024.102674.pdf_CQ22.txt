The paper uses three main metrics to evaluate the performance of the machine learning models: Percent Bias (pbias), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). These metrics are used to compare the observed and predicted temperature values. The percent bias measures the average tendency of the predicted values to be larger or smaller than the observed ones. Positive pbias values indicate underestimation, while negative values suggest overestimation. MAE and RMSE are common validation metrics that measure the average magnitude of errors in a set of predictions without considering their direction. They provide insights into the overall error distribution and help identify outliers. The formulas for calculating these metrics are given in the text.
