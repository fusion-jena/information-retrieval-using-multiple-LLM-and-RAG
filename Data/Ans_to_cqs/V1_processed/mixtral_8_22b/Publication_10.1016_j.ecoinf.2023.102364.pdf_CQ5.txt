The article does not mention any use of image datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it uses a dataset containing 2014-2015 Short-billed Gull presence/absence data along with 68 open-access predictor layers, including socio-economic US Census data. These datasets were used to train an ensemble of machine learning models in Salford Predictive Modeler (SPM) v8.3. The goal was to create predictions of gull-abundance hotspots and coldspots at a 100-m resolution for inference.
