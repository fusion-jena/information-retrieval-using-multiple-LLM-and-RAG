The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involved using TensorBoard, which is a set of visualization tools included in the open-source library for machine learning TensorFlow. Each optimization run consisted of 3000 train iterations with a batch size of 25 individuals to pick a pair of similar and a pair of dissimilar photos (i.e., a batch size of 100 images), and validating every 300 iterations. The selected parameters corresponded to the run shown in Supplementary Fig. S3.
