The given context does not provide explicit information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it mentions the use of data augmentation techniques to improve the robustness of the model.

Data augmentation is a strategy that enables practitioners to significantly increase the diversity of training datasets available for a machine learning task using label-preserving transformations. In this case, the authors apply random transformations to the input images, including rotations, flips, and changes in brightness, saturation, and hue. These techniques help reduce overfitting and improve the generalization capabilities of the model by exposing it to various versions of the same image.

While these techniques do not directly target data biases, they can contribute indirectly to mitigating them by increasing the variability within the dataset. Nonetheless, addressing data biases more explicitly might require additional strategies like those mentioned in the query, which are not discussed in the provided context.
