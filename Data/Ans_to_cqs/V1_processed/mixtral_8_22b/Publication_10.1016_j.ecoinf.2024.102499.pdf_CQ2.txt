The deep learning pipeline primarily uses video format data. Specifically, baited remote underwater video stations (BRUVS) are employed to capture footage of marine life, including various shark species and other aquatic organisms. These videos are then transformed into still images at a rate of 1 frame per second. Subsequently, these images are utilized for training and testing the deep learning model. Additionally, the authors mention that they could not directly use individual images from their dataset due to similarities among them, leading to potential overfitting issues. Therefore, they opted for a 80% training/20% testing random split on videos instead of images to ensure independence between the training and testing sets.
