The context does not provide specific details about the criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, common practices include monitoring metrics like validation loss or accuracy during training and stopping when these values reach a plateau or desired threshold. Other methods may involve setting a maximum number of epochs or using early stopping techniques. Without explicit information, it cannot be definitively stated what criteria were used in this case.
