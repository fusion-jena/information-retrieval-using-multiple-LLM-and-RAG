The text mentions several types of deep learning models, including ResNet, ViT, Swin, and ConvNeXt. All of these models fall under the category of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), except for the Vision Transformer (ViT). However, since the ViT did not improve upon the results of ResNet, it was not chosen for further use in the pipeline. Therefore, the pipeline primarily uses CNN models, specifically ResNet, Swin, and ConvNeXt.
