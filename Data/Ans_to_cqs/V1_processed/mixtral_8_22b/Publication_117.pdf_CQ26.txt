The text does not provide explicit information on specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some general insights can be derived from the context.

In generating a training dataset, the authors randomly selected 500 survey images. This suggests that they might have used stratified sampling or similar techniques to ensure diverse representation in their training data.

After passing the images through a version of the YOLO Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN), the authors filtered the results by discarding any object detections that did not correspond to an identification from the Zooniverse data. This step could potentially mitigate overfitting and improve model performance.

Moreover, the authors acknowledge that while the trained algorithm achieved high accuracy levels, it relied on crowd-sourced data to create the training sets. They suggest viewing both methods—deep learning and citizen science—as complementary approaches, with citizen science data forming the foundation for automated algorithms.

This implies that the authors recognize the importance of diverse data collection and its impact on reducing data bias. Although the text does not explicitly mention oversampling, undersampling, or other specific techniques, the overall approach seems to focus on ensuring diversity and representativeness in the training data.
