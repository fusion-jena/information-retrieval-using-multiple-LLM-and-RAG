The given context primarily discusses the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for analyzing aerial images of whales. The specific application involves using these models to detect whales in new images based on patterns learned during training. From this information, we can infer that one of the primary data formats used in this deep learning pipeline is image data.

In general, deep learning pipelines can utilize various data formats depending on the problem being addressed. These formats include but are not limited to images, audio files, videos, and structured data like CSV or Excel files. However, the context provided does not explicitly mention any other data format besides images. Therefore, it is safe to conclude that the deep learning pipeline discussed here predominantly uses image data.
