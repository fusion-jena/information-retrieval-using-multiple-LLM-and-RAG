The given context does not provide information about specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the authors evaluated their models using a two-class binary output and a fully connected network with layers {100,2}. They also discuss applying transductive propagation and other semi-supervised learning techniques, but do not specify any particular dataset names. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the datasets used in this study.
