To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. One common approach is stratified splitting, which involves dividing the dataset into subsets based on specific criteria, ensuring each subset has a representative sample of the overall dataset. This technique helps maintain the balance of classes within the dataset, preventing overfitting or underfitting due to imbalanced data.

Oversampling and undersampling are additional methods used to handle class imbalance. Oversampling increases the number of instances in the minority class by duplicating existing samples or generating synthetic examples. Undersampling reduces the majority class size by randomly removing instances or employing more sophisticated techniques like NearMiss or Tomek Links. Both approaches aim to achieve a balanced dataset, improving model performance and generalization.

Diverse data collection is another strategy to mitigate data bias. By collecting data from various sources, demographics, or environments, it becomes possible to capture a broader range of features and patterns, leading to better representation and reduced bias. In the context provided, one suggestion is to gather images from social media platforms targeting outdoor enthusiasts instead of formal gardens, thereby minimizing potential biases related to plant species or locations.

Lastly, filtering images before classification can help eliminate irrelevant or misleading information. Researchers can apply filters based on metadata, image quality, or content, ensuring only relevant and high-quality data enters the deep learning pipeline. This step contributes to improved model performance and reliability.
