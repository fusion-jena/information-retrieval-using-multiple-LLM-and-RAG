The data was split into three distinct datasets: training, validation, and testing. The training dataset was used during the training phase of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), where the network learns to recognize patterns in the input data. The validation dataset was employed to evaluate the performance of the CNN throughout the training process. This allowed for tuning hyperparameters and preventing overfitting, which occurs when the model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data. Lastly, the testing dataset was utilized to assess the final performance of the fully trained CNN using independent data that the model had never encountered before. Manual annotations were generated for all three datasets, ensuring accurate labeling of the input data.
