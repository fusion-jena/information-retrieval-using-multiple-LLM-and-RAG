Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available in the given context to determine the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the type of optimizer. However, it can be inferred that the authors used a pre-trained VGGnet and fine-tuned its weights using the Benthoz15 dataset. They also mention employing a Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) network for classification, consisting of two fully connected hidden layers of neurons followed by an output layer with 2 nodes: corals and non-corals. The number of neurons in the hidden layers was optimized for maximum performance. Nevertheless, details regarding other hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, epochs, or the choice of optimizer remain unknown.
