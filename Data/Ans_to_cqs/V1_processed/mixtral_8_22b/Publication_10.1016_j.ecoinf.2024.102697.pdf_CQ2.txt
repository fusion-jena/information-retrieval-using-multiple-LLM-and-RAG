The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the studies mentioned in the context likely involve various types of data formats depending on the nature of the research. For instance, the study by Zhang et al. (2023) focuses on detecting time-delay water quality indicators of wastewater treatment plant influents, suggesting that the data format could include time series data, possibly in CSV or similar formats. On the other hand, the study by Zheng and Jia (2022) evaluates different methods for soil heat flux estimation at large scales using remote sensing observations, implying that satellite imagery or geospatial data might be involved.

Random Forest models, which are employed in these studies, are versatile and can handle various data formats such as numerical, categorical, textual, and even images when combined with appropriate preprocessing steps. Nonetheless, without explicit information about the exact data formats used in each study, we cannot provide a definitive answer.
