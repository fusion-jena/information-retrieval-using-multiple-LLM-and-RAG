The paper does not explicitly mention any specific evaluation metric such as accuracy, precision, or recall. However, it does provide some insights into how well the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) performed. It mentions that after 10 trials, the CNN's accuracy on the filtered data averaged to 99.22%, and the accuracy on the non-filtered data averaged to 99.25%. This suggests that the authors might have used accuracy as one of their primary evaluation metrics. Additionally, they also present a table showing the number of matches and mismatches between the predictions made by the CNN and the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm. While this doesn't give us explicit details about the evaluation metrics used, it provides some insight into how the models were evaluated.
