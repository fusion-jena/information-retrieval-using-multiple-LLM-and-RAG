Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to determine which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning models mentioned, namely ResNet and GoogLeNet. The context only provides details about the architecture, performance, and characteristics of these models but does not discuss any implementation or deployment aspects related to cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. Therefore, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer to the query based solely on the given context.
