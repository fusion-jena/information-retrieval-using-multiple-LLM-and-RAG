The text does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it mentions the use of the Adam optimizer, which is known to be robust against noisy gradients due to its adaptive learning rates. This could potentially help mitigate some effects of randomness. Additionally, the authors suggest implementing the same hyperparameters as the YOLO model, which might include specific settings related to randomness management. Nonetheless, without more detailed information, it cannot be definitively stated what exact strategies were used to manage randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
