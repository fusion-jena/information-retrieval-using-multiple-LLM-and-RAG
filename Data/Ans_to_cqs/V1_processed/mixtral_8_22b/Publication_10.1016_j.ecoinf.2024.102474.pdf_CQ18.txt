During the training process, the model's performance was monitored by evaluating its score on the validation dataset. This evaluation was carried out after each epoch, which refers to one complete pass through the entire training dataset. The optimization process was halted once the validation score ceased to show improvement over several consecutive epochs. The specific metric used to evaluate the model's performance appears to be the EarthNetScore (ENS). The model with the highest attained validation score was then chosen for further use. It was also observed that using the baseline framework significantly sped up convergence, particularly for the Mean Absolute Difference (MAD) metric.
