The given text does not explicitly mention any specific datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it discusses the use of synthetic data and real LiDAR point cloud data for training deep neural networks (DNNs), specifically for semantic classification tasks related to fuel model retrieval. It also mentions the use of Sentinel-2 multispectral (MS) imagery for semantic classification of forest and non-forest features. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot identify any standard datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. Instead, custom datasets consisting of synthetic data and real LiDAR point cloud data have been utilized.
