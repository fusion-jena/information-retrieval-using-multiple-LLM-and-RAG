Based on the given context, it appears that the study uses a MaxEnt model for its analysis. However, there is no explicit information regarding the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. In general, common criteria for determining when training is complete include reaching a certain number of epochs or iterations, achieving a desired level of accuracy or performance, or observing a plateau in the validation loss. Without more specific details about the MaxEnt model implementation, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based solely on the provided context.
