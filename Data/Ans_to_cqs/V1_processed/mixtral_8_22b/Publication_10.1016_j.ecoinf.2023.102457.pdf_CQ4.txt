Unfortunately, there isn't any explicit mention of specific data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotation, or scaling being applied in the given context. Data augmentation techniques are often employed to increase the amount of training data available by applying random transformations to existing data, thereby creating new samples. These techniques can help improve the robustness and generalization capabilities of machine learning models. However, without more information, it cannot be confirmed whether these particular techniques were utilized in this case.
