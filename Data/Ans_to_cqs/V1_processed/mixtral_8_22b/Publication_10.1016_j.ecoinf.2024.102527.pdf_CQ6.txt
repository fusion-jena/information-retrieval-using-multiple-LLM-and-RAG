The paper does not provide explicit information about specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning before training the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the authors used the ResNext-101 model, which is a type of Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN). Typically, preprocessing steps for DCNNs include resizing input images, converting them into grayscale or RGB format, normalizing pixel values, and applying data augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, zooming, or cropping. These preprocessing steps help improve the model's performance by reducing overfitting and enhancing generalizability.
