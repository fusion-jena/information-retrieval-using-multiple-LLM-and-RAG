The deep learning model uses Backpropagation as the learning algorithm and Adam as the optimizer. It employs a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) architecture with a filter size of 2. Dropout regularization technique is applied with a value of 50% in the first three layers to prevent overfitting and enhance generalization. These initial layers consist of 256 nodes each, while the last layer corresponds to the number of classes present in the dataset. However, the specific learning rate used in the model is not mentioned in the given context.
