The provided context does not directly discuss strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it does mention several strategies related to improving the accuracy and efficiency of cetacean vocalization detection using deep learning models. These include leveraging multi-annotation campaigns involving both expert and novice annotators, addressing annotation discrepancies through training CNNs on annotations from both groups, and employing annotation aggregation methods like majority voting and soft labeling. While these strategies do not specifically target handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, they contribute to enhancing the robustness and reliability of the models by reducing variability and improving overall annotation quality.
