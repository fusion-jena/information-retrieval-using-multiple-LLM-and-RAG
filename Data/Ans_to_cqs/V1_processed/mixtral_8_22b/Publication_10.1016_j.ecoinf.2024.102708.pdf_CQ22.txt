The performance of the deep learning models is evaluated using several metrics such as precision, recall, and F-score. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of total predicted positives, while recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of actual positives. The F-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single measure of the model's overall performance. Additionally, the uncertainties of these metrics are estimated by calculating the Confidence Interval (CI), which provides a range within which the true value lies with a certain level of confidence.
