The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data format(s) used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses the application of deep learning techniques for predicting oil palm crop yields, which suggests that the data could be related to agricultural factors such as climate patterns, soil quality, fertilizer use, and seed varieties. Given this information, possible data formats include structured data like CSV files containing numerical values representing these factors, or even satellite imagery if remote sensing data were incorporated. Nevertheless, without explicit confirmation from the source material, we cannot definitively state the exact data format(s) utilized in the deep learning pipeline.
