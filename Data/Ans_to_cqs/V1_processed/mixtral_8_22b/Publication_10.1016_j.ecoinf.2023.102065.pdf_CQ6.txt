The text does not provide explicit details about specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning models. However, it mentions that the models were trained on mel-spectrograms derived from sound data. This implies that the raw sound data was transformed into a visual representation (mel-spectrogram) before being fed into the deep learning models. Additionally, the text discusses tuning of network hyperparameters and convolutional filters, which suggests some form of parameter optimization or selection may have been performed during the preprocessing stage. Unfortunately, no further details regarding any specific preprocessing techniques like normalization, scaling, or cleaning are mentioned in the given context.
