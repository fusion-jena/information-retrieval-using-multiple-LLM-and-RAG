The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, based on general practices in machine learning, common postprocessing steps include evaluating the performance of the trained model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc. Another step might involve creating visualizations like confusion matrices, ROC curves, or saliency maps to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of the model. Additionally, hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation techniques might also be employed during this stage to further optimize the model's performance.
