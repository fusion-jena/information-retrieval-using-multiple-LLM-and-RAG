The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, considering the information available, we can infer that the deep learning model referred to here is likely being used for time series forecasting or prediction. Specifically, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model is employed to address the prediction problem of time series data, particularly those involving long-term dependencies and multivariate time series data. This model is compared with other models like the Backpropagation (BP) model and the Markov Chain model. Therefore, the primary purpose of this deep learning model appears to be predicting or forecasting time series data related to land use patterns and their associated ecosystem services.
