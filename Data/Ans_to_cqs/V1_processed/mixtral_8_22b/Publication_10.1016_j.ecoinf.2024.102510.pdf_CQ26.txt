To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be utilized. One common approach is stratified splitting, which involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes in both sets. This ensures that the model is exposed to a representative sample of each class during training, reducing the risk of bias towards any particular class.

Oversampling and undersampling are also popular techniques used to handle class imbalance in datasets. Oversampling involves duplicating examples from the minority class to match the number of examples in the majority class. Undersampling, on the other hand, reduces the number of examples in the majority class to match the number of examples in the minority class. Both techniques aim to create a balanced dataset, improving the model's ability to learn from underrepresented classes.

Collecting diverse data is another essential technique to mitigate data bias. As mentioned earlier, utilizing an imbalanced dataset for training a deep learning model may introduce inherent biases and limitations. To overcome this, efforts should be made to gather comprehensive and diverse datasets that accurately reflect the true variability of the target population. For instance, in the case of bird species recognition, collecting data from various geographic locations and habitats would help capture the diversity of bird populations present in the wild.

In addition to these techniques, data augmentation plays a vital role in addressing data bias. It involves expanding the dataset by applying transformations to the existing data, such as flipping, translation, and shear. Data augmentation helps maintain dataset balance, reduce overfitting, and improve the generalization of deep learning models. By employing these techniques, researchers can significantly enhance the performance and reliability of their deep learning models.
