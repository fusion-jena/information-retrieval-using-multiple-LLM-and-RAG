The information provided does not explicitly state the purpose of a specific deep learning model. However, based on the context given, it can be inferred that the deep learning models mentioned might be used for tasks such as land use classification, habitat modeling, or urban planning. The references to various types of land cover, including urban areas, croplands, and different types of vegetation cover, suggest that these models could be used to classify or segment images into different categories of land use. Additionally, the mention of habitat factors related to wildlife conservation suggests that these models may also be used for predictive modeling of suitable habitats for certain species. Overall, without more specific information about the deep learning models being discussed, it is difficult to determine their exact purpose.
