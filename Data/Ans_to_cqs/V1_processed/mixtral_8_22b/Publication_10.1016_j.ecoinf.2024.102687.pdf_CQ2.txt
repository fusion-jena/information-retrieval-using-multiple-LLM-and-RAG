The deep learning pipeline primarily uses images as its input format. Specifically, the input image is preprocessed by decomposing the spectrogram into a multi-channel image. This process involves converting the original spectrogram in decibels (dB) into a 3-channel "sound image" consisting of harmonic, percussive, and delta (HPD) features. These features are derived using the harmonic and percussive separation (HPS) method. The resulting multi-channel image serves as the input to the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for further processing and analysis.
