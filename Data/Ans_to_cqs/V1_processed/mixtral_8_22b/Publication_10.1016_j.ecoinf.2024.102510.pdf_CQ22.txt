The performance of deep learning models is typically evaluated using several key metrics such as validation accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Validation accuracy measures the proportion of correctly classified instances in the validation dataset. Precision quantifies the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances among all instances predicted as positive. Recall, also known as sensitivity or true positive rate, measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all actual positive instances. The F1-score provides a single measure that combines both precision and recall into a single value, representing their harmonic mean. These metrics help assess the effectiveness of the model in accurately classifying instances and identifying relevant patterns within the data.
