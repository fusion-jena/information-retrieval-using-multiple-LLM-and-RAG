While the given context does not explicitly mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), it discusses another optimization method called Tree-Structured Parzen Estimator (TPE). This method is employed to improve the performance of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms by identifying the optimal hyperparameter sets for each ML model. It works by estimating the probability distribution of the hyperparameters using a probabilistic model and iteratively constructing a tree of Gaussian distributions to approximate the objective function. However, this information alone cannot provide a direct comparison between TPE and traditional optimization methods like SGD or Adam. Therefore, further research into the literature discussing these optimization techniques within the context of deep learning pipelines would be necessary to fully address the query.
