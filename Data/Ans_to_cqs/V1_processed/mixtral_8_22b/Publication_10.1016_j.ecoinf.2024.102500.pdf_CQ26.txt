The provided context does not directly mention any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it does discuss some methods used to improve the accuracy and predictive capabilities of machine learning models when dealing with imbalanced small datasets.

One approach mentioned is the use of ensemble models, which combine multiple weak learners to create a stronger prediction model. This can help reduce overfitting, which is a common problem when working with smaller datasets. For example, Adedeji et al. (2022) used ensemble models like Random Forest - Extreme Gradient Boosting (RF-XGB) to predict stream water quality. Similarly, Panahi et al. (2022) used an ensemble bagging technique combined with Support Vector Machines (SVM) to predict stream flow and water quality.

In addition, the context mentions hyperparameter tuning for LightGBM (LGBM) and Gradient Boosting (GB) models. Hyperparameters like subsample, min\_child\_samples, reg\_lambda, n\_estimators, learning\_rate, max\_depth, and random\_state are adjusted to optimize model performance. While this doesn't specifically address data bias, it contributes to improving the overall accuracy and reliability of predictions made by the models.

Overall, while the provided context does not explicitly cover techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing, it highlights several strategies for enhancing the performance of machine learning models when dealing with imbalanced small datasets.
