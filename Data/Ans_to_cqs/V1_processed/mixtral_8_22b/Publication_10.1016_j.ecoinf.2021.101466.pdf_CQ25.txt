The purpose of the deep learning model in this case is object detection. This can be determined by examining the references to YOLOv4, a well-known real-time object detection algorithm, and the use of Intersection over Union (IoU), a common metric for evaluating object detection models. Additionally, the text mentions using EfficientNet, a convolutional neural network architecture designed for object detection tasks. Furthermore, the goal of the study is to identify insects within images, which also suggests object detection as the primary task.
