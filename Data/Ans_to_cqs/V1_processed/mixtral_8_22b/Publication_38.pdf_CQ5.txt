The text does not provide explicit information about specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the authors tested their method on a dataset from iBats Romania and Bulgaria. This dataset appears to contain audio recordings of bat calls, which were then converted into spectrograms for analysis using various machine learning techniques, including CNNFULL and CNNFAST.
