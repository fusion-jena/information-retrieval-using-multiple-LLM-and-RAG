In the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall being used to measure the performance of the deep learning model. However, based on common practices in evaluating deep learning models, these metrics could potentially have been used.

For instance, when comparing the proposed method to IA-YOLO and YOLOv8s baselines, improvements in terms of percentage points are mentioned. While not explicitly stated, these improvements might refer to increases in accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or other similar metrics commonly used in object detection tasks.

Additionally, the text mentions that the proposed method demonstrates superior performance across various environments, enabling faster transitions from field surveys to reporting, especially in challenging conditions. This suggests that the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the deep learning model were considered while evaluating its performance.

However, without more detailed information about the exact evaluation process and criteria, it is impossible to definitively state which specific metrics were used to gauge the performance of the deep learning model.
