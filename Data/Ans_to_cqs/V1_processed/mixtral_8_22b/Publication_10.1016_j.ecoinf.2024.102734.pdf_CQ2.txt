The deep learning pipeline uses single-channel images derived from Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) as input data format. These images are then processed through various models including ResNet-50, Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST), and HuBERT. The ResNet-50 and AST operate on the spectrogram, while HuBERT works directly on the 1-D waveform.
