The text does not provide explicit information about the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions various models such as Cascade RCNN, FCOS, Sparse CNN, Faster CNN, ATSS, and RepPoint. These models could have been trained using popular optimization techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). Unfortunately, without additional details, we cannot confirm which specific optimization technique was employed during the training process.
