The text mentions the use of random under sampling (RUS) to address imbalances in the training set during the validation phase of the machine learning algorithms. This technique falls under the category of undersampling, which is a common method used to handle class imbalance in datasets. Undersampling involves reducing the size of the majority class to match the minority class, thus balancing the distribution of classes in the dataset. In contrast, oversampling increases the size of the minority class to balance the dataset. Both undersampling and oversampling can be effective in addressing data bias caused by class imbalance. Another technique mentioned in the text is stratified sampling, which is used to divide the feature set into four mutually exclusive folds. Stratified sampling ensures that each fold contains a representative sample of the entire dataset, preserving the original class distribution within each fold. This approach helps maintain the diversity of the data across different subsets, preventing any single subset from being dominated by a particular class. Lastly, collecting diverse data is another important technique to address data bias. By ensuring that the dataset includes examples from all relevant categories, it becomes possible to train models that generalize well to new, unseen data. However, this aspect is not explicitly discussed in the given text.
