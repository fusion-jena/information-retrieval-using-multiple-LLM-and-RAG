The text does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that geospatial data are offered as standardized NetCDF files. Therefore, we can infer that the deep learning pipeline might utilize NetCDF files as one of its data formats. Additionally, since the workflow involves statistical analysis and classification of large input datasets, it could also potentially involve other data formats such as CSV or similar tabular data formats. Nevertheless, without explicit information about the deep learning pipeline's data formats, this remains speculative.
