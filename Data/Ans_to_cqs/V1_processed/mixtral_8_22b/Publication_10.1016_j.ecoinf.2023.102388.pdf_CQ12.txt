The pipeline uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Specifically, the VGG16 architecture is employed, which consists of five sets of convolutional layers alternating with five max-pooling layers, followed by two fully connected layers and an output layer. The architecture includes fine-tuning of VGG16 by unfreezing the last two blocks (block 4 and block 5) to update their weights in each epoch. Additionally, adjustments are made to the final dense layer in each CNN to accommodate the specific number of classes representing beluga individuals in each dataset.
