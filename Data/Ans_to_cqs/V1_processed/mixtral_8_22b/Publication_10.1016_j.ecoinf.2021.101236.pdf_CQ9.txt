The given context does not explicitly mention where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it provides information about the components used in building the BirdNET algorithm, which includes diversifying the training data, employing changes suggested in (Xie et al., 2018), deriving the classification block from (Schl√ºter, 2018), and treating spectrograms as monochrome input images. It also mentions that the overall training process followed current best practices in deep learning. Unfortunately, without additional context, I cannot determine the exact location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline.
