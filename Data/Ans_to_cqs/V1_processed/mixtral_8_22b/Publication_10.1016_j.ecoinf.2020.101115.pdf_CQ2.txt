The information provided does not directly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the given context, we can infer that the primary data format used in this case is likely to be images. This is because the text mentions that scale and otolith images are used for age and growth estimations, and these images are stored in a collaborative online space. The image file name for any image is also mentioned to be the same as the unique archive sample ID in the IFBA database. Therefore, it can be assumed that the main data format used in the deep learning pipeline would be images.
