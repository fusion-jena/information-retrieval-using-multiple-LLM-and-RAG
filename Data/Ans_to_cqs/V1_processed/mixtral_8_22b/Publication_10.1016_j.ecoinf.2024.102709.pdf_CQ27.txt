The text does not explicitly mention the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, it provides information about the training process and evaluation metrics. To deploy a trained deep learning model like this one, common steps include model serialization, platform selection, and integration with existing systems or applications.

Model serialization involves saving the trained model parameters and architecture in a format that can be loaded later for inference. This could be done using popular libraries such as TensorFlow's `tf.saved_model` or PyTorch's `torch.save`.

Platform selection depends on various factors, including hardware requirements, scalability needs, and ease of integration. Some popular platforms for deploying deep learning models include AWS SageMaker, Google Cloud AI Platform, Azure Machine Learning, and edge devices like NVIDIA Jetson boards.

Integration with existing systems or applications may require additional work, depending on the complexity of the application and the chosen deployment platform. This might involve setting up APIs, creating custom frontends, or integrating with databases and other backend services.
