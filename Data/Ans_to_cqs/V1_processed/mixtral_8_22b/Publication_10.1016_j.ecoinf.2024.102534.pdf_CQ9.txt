The given context does not provide explicit information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it mentions GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) twice, once in relation to a checklist dataset for Orchidaceae and another time in reference to a publication titled "Phytogeography of New Guinean Orchids." Given this information, one might infer that the data used in the study could be found within the GBIF database. Nevertheless, without more specific details regarding the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the query, it is impossible to definitively state where its data repository can be located.
