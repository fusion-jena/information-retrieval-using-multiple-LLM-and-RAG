The purpose of the deep learning model, referred to as BatNet, is to classify and identify different species of tropical bats based on their echolocation calls. This model is incorporated into the software Waveman and utilizes 22 convolutional layers to extract useful acoustic features from spectrogram images of bat calls. Additionally, it employs eight shortcut connections between layers to avoid the issue of information loss as the layer number increases. The goal of this model is to improve the accuracy of identifying and classifying different bat species based on their unique vocalizations.
