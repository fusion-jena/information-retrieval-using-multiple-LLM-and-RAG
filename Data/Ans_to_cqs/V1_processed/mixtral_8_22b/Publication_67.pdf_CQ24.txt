The strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline include setting a fixed random seed value, which ensures reproducibility by initializing the weights and biases of the neural network in the same way every time the code is run. Another strategy is to use deterministic algorithms or set their parameters to ensure consistent outputs. Additionally, some libraries provide options to control the randomness, such as TensorFlow's tf.random.set\_seed() function. It is also important to note that while controlling randomness can help with debugging and comparing different approaches, it may limit the exploration of the solution space during training. Therefore, it is essential to strike a balance between controlling randomness and allowing enough variability for effective learning.

Based on the given context, there isn't any direct information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, one possible approach could be using techniques like setting a fixed random seed value or employing deterministic algorithms, as mentioned above. These methods can help maintain consistency across multiple runs of the model, ensuring reproducible results.
