The text does not provide explicit details about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions some techniques relevant to handling imbalanced datasets or improving model performance. These include identifying key variables based on their percent contribution and permutation importance scores, comparing characteristics of those key variables between potential and non-potential areas, and employing the Continuous Boyce Index (CBI) along with the Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) to evaluate model performance. While these methods do not directly address data bias, they can help improve model accuracy and robustness. To specifically tackle data bias, common techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection could be applied depending on the nature of the dataset and the specific biases present.
