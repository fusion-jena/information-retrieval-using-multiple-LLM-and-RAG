Based on the provided context, it appears that the study does not explicitly mention the use of any specific deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. Instead, the authors focus on employing a penalized loss function with an L1 penalty for simultaneous shrinkage estimation and variable selection. This approach involves setting a constant tuning parameter and computing the L1 penalized estimates using the gradient ascent method. Therefore, based solely on the information available, I cannot determine which type of deep learning model, if any, was utilized in this particular study.
