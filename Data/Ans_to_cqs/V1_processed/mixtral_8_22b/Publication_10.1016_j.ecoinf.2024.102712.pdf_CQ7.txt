Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it can be inferred that some form of data splitting was performed due to the mention of leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV), which is a type of resampling method used for evaluating machine learning algorithms.

In general, when working with datasets for deep learning model training, common practices include randomly splitting the data into three subsets: training set, validation set, and testing set. This division helps prevent overfitting by allowing the model to learn patterns from the training data while also being able to evaluate its performance on unseen data during both the training process (using the validation set) and after the final model has been trained (using the testing set).

While the exact criteria for splitting the data in this case aren't mentioned, typical approaches involve dividing the data into these subsets using percentages such as 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing, or similar ratios depending on the size of the dataset and the requirements of the project.
