Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide a direct link to the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context. However, it can be noted that the study used MCD43A4 V6.1 data obtained from the Google Earth Engine platform. This dataset was used for satellite path h27v06, spanning October 29, 2022, to December 20, 2022. The data underwent pre-processing steps such as mosaicking and clipping. The data access link is provided as <https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/MODIS_061_MCD43A4>. It should also be noted that this link was last accessed on May 1, 2023.

However, without additional details about the specific deep learning pipeline or any associated code repositories, it is not possible to provide a more precise answer regarding the location of the deep learning pipeline itself.
