The information provided does not specify where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that the training set used for the experiments included data from 347 road-transect sampling events of 137 different transects collected between 2006 and 2011 in Romania and Bulgaria. However, it does not provide any information about the availability or location of the data repository. Therefore, I do not have enough information to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
