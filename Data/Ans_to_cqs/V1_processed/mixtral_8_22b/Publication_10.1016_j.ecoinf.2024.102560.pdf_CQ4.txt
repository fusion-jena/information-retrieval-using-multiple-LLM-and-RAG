Based on the provided context, there is no information about the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, and shifting. These techniques help increase the amount of training data available and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data. Without further context or information, it cannot be determined which specific techniques were used in this case.
