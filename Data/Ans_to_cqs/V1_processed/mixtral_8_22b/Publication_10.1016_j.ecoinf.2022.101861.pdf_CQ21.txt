The given context does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, common postprocessing steps include generating saliency maps to visualize which parts of the input data most influenced the model's predictions, calculating metrics such as accuracy or F1 score to evaluate the performance of the model, and creating confusion matrices to understand how well the model is able to distinguish between different classes. These steps can help researchers better understand their models and improve them if necessary.
