The text does not provide explicit details about the strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, based on common practices in deep learning, some possible strategies could include tracking metrics like accuracy or loss over epochs, using validation sets to evaluate generalization performance, or employing techniques like early stopping to prevent overfitting. The authors mention using the ResNet50 architecture with ImageNet weights and the AdamW optimizer, but do not specify any particular monitoring strategy.
