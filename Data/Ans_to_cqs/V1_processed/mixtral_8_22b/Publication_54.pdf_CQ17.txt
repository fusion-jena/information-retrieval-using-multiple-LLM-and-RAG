Regularization methods are techniques used in machine learning models, including deep learning pipelines, to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function during optimization. This encourages simpler models and reduces the risk of memorizing the training data instead of learning meaningful patterns. Two common regularization methods mentioned in the provided context are dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a regularization method where randomly selected neurons are temporarily removed ("dropped out") from the network during each iteration of training. This helps prevent complex co-adaptations between neurons and promotes learning more robust features. Dropout effectively creates an ensemble of smaller networks within the main network, which improves its overall performance and generalization capabilities.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty proportional to the square of the magnitude of all weights in the network to the loss function. By penalizing large weights, L2 regularization discourages individual neurons from having too much influence on the output, thus reducing overfitting. It encourages the network to distribute the learned information across multiple neurons rather than relying heavily on specific ones.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention other regularization methods like L1 regularization or early stopping, they are worth noting as additional techniques to combat overfitting in deep learning pipelines. L1 regularization adds a penalty proportional to the absolute value of the weights, promoting sparse solutions and potentially leading to feature selection. Early stopping involves monitoring the model's performance on a separate validation set during training and halting the process once the validation error starts increasing, indicating that the model might be beginning to overfit.
