Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. Regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization are commonly employed to avoid overfitting, but without further information, I cannot confirm if they were utilized in this particular case.
