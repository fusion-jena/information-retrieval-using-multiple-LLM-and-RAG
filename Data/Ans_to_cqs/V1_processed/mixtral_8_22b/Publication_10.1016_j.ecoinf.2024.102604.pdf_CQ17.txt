Regularization methods are techniques used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise along with underlying patterns, resulting in poor generalization performance on unseen data. Two common regularization methods are Dropout and L2 Regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, effectively creating a thinned network for each iteration. This helps prevent complex co-adaptations between neurons, reducing overfitting. The dropped out neurons do not contribute to the forward pass or backpropagation, but their weights are still updated. During testing, all neurons are included without dropout.

L2 Regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function based on the sum of squares of the weights. By adding this penalty, the optimization process encourages smaller weights, leading to simpler models that are less likely to overfit. The strength of the penalty can be controlled using a hyperparameter called the regularization parameter.

Other regularization methods include L1 Regularization, Early Stopping, and Data Augmentation. L1 Regularization adds a penalty term based on the absolute value of the weights, promoting sparse solutions. Early Stopping monitors validation error during training and stops when it starts increasing, indicating overfitting. Data Augmentation generates additional training examples by applying transformations like rotation, scaling, or flipping to existing samples, helping the model generalize better.
