The text does not explicitly mention which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it mentions that Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a cloud-based platform that facilitates high-performance computing with high applicability in wildfire science. It also states that GEE hosts a vast remote sensing data catalog in the petabyte scale, including datasets from the European Space Agency (ESA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) over 40 years. Therefore, it can be inferred that the deep learning model might have been deployed on the Google Earth Engine platform. However, this information is not explicitly stated in the given context.
