The text does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the authors employed two prominent models from the scikit-learn library - RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV - for hyperparameter optimization of the RF (Random Forest) algorithm. These techniques help explore and fine-tune the hyperparameter space to improve the performance of the RF algorithm. While the exact hyperparameters are not mentioned, they could include parameters such as the number of trees, maximum depth of trees, minimum samples required to split nodes, etc. Unfortunately, without explicit information, one cannot definitively state the specific hyperparameters used in this case.
