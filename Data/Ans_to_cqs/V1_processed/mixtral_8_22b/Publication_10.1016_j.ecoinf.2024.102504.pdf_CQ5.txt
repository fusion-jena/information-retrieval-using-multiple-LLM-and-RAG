The given context does not provide information about specific datasets used in any deep learning pipelines such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it mentions several studies related to air quality prediction using various techniques like deep learning LSTM, multi-layer perceptrons, and satellite imagery analysis. These studies may have utilized relevant datasets containing air pollutant concentrations, meteorological data, land use patterns, etc. For instance, one study focuses on assessing nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels as a contributing factor to coronavirus (COVID-19) fatality, while another discusses fly ash deposits as a potential sink for carbon sequestration. Another research paper explores spatio-temporal learning in predicting ambient particulate matter concentration using multi-layer perceptrons. Therefore, without further details regarding each study's dataset, we cannot definitively state which specific datasets were employed in their respective deep learning pipelines.
