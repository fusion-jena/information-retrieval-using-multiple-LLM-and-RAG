The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated based on several metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. However, in this study, the primary metric used to assess the performance of the models is the rate of correct classification. The mean rate of correct classification for humans was found to be 89.3%, while the best model achieved a rate of 94.9%. Additionally, the standard deviation of the correct classification rates was reported for both humans and the best model. These results indicate that the best model outperformed humans in terms of the rate of correct classification.
