The given context does not provide information about any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotation, or scaling. The text only mentions that no additional preprocessing was applied to the spectrograms, aiming to demonstrate the power of human-machine teaming by minimizing preprocessing steps. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which, if any, data augmentation techniques were used based solely on the provided context.
