The given context does not provide information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the paper titled "Monitoring ecosystem service change in the City of Shenzhen by the use of high-resolution remotely sensed imagery and deep learning" by Huang et al. However, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. These techniques help label the input data with relevant information, which is then used to train machine learning models. In this case, since the paper focuses on using high-resolution remotely sensed imagery, it can be assumed that image annotation techniques were employed. But without further details, we cannot confirm the exact methods used.
