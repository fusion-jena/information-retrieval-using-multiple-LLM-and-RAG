The text does not provide explicit information about specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it mentions that data augmentation is employed to prepare the training dataset for the EfficientNet model. Data augmentation involves creating new training samples by applying various transformations to existing ones, such as rotation, flipping, zooming, cropping, etc. This technique helps improve the robustness and generalizability of the model. Additionally, the text states that the dropout rate for each task was set at 0.5, which is a regularization technique used during training to prevent overfitting. It can be inferred that these techniques serve as preprocessing steps before training the deep learning model.
