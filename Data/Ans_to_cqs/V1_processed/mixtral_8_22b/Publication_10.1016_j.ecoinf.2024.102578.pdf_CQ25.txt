The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred from the information given. The article mentions using the ResNet-50 architecture, which is typically employed for object recognition tasks such as image classification, localization, and detection. Furthermore, the use of MegaDetector, a tool designed for detecting animals and people in photos, suggests that the primary goal of the deep learning model is likely related to object detection. This is further supported by the mention of cropping out detected objects from images and classifying them by object type. Therefore, it appears that the main objective of the deep learning model is to identify and categorize various objects within the images, including rocks, bait, and different animal species.
