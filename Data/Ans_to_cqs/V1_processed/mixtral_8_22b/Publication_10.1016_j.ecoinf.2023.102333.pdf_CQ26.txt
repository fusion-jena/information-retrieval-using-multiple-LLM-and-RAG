The context does not provide specific information about techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, common techniques mentioned in literature include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets or strata based on certain criteria, ensuring each subset maintains a similar distribution of classes or features as the original dataset. This technique helps prevent class imbalance issues during training and evaluation.

Oversampling and undersampling are methods used to balance datasets with unequal class distributions. Oversampling increases the number of instances from the minority class, while undersampling reduces the number of instances from the majority class. These techniques can be applied randomly or through more sophisticated approaches like Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and NearMiss.

Diverse data collection focuses on gathering a wide range of examples representing various scenarios, conditions, and populations. This approach aims to reduce potential biases introduced by limited or skewed data sources, promoting fairness and generalizability in deep learning models.
