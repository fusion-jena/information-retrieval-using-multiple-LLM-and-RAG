The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it discusses various approaches employed by different systems to improve their performance in handling events of varying durations and lengths. These include dividing long audio files into shorter chunks, joining detections spanning these chunks in post-processing, using adaptive segment lengths depending on each target class, implementing ensemble approaches focusing on different input size ranges, and employing multi-scale ResNets or wide ResNets containing many channels. Additionally, some systems use transductive few-shot learning methods like joint modeling of support and query set nodes as a graph or learning a cross-attention based map between support and query sets to improve predictions on individual query examples.
