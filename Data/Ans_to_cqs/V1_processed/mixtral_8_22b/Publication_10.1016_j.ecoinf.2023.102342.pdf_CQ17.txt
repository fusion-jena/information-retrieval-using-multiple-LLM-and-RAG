Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, the context mentions pruning as a data compression technique in machine learning and search algorithms that reduces the size of decision trees by removing sections of the tree that are non-critical and redundant to classify instances. Pruning reduces the complexity of the final classifier and improves the predictive accuracy by reducing overfitting. Therefore, while not explicitly mentioned, pruning could be considered a form of regularization used to prevent overfitting in this context.
