Based on the given context, it appears that no specific deep learning framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch has been mentioned. Instead, several machine learning packages and tools have been utilized for various purposes within this research. These include "sdm," "dismo," "bioclim," and "biomod2" for testing prediction power with machine learning algorithms, and "shiny" packages for extracting model mean performances. Additionally, statistical analyses were conducted using R, specifically RStudio. However, none of these directly indicate the use of any popular deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, based solely on the provided information, it cannot be determined which frameworks were used to build the deep learning model.
