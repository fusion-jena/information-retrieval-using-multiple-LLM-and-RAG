Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available in the given context to determine which specific framework was used to build the deep learning model. The text mentions using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and fine-tuning the weights of a pre-trained VGGnet, but it does not specify whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or another framework was used to implement these components. Therefore, without additional context, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer to this query.
