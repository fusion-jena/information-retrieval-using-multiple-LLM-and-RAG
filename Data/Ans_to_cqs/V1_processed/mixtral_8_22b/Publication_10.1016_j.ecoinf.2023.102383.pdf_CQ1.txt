The paper does not explicitly mention the method used for collecting raw data in their deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, we can infer that the authors use Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) thermal images for their study. This is evident from the statement, "For instance, an object with dimensions of 15 Ã— 15 pixels in a UAV thermal image..." Therefore, one possible method for collecting raw data could be through the use of UAVs equipped with thermal cameras. Additionally, since the paper discusses the application of deep learning techniques for deer survey, it is also likely that the authors may have used publicly available datasets or manually labeled datasets for training and testing their models. However, without explicit mention in the text, these assumptions remain speculative.
