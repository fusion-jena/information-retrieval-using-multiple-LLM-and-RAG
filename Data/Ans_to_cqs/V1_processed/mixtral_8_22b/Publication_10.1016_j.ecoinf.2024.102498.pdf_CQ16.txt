Based on the given context, the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau, are not explicitly stated. However, the text does mention that validation data were employed for tuning the key hyperparameters for each model. This suggests that some form of monitoring or assessment of the model's performance on the validation dataset occurred during the training process. Additionally, the table presenting the hyperparameters set for each model implies that certain parameters related to the structure and complexity of the models were predefined before training began. Therefore, while the exact stopping criterion for training is not specified, it can be inferred that the models were trained with consideration for their performance on the validation dataset and according to preset hyperparameters.
