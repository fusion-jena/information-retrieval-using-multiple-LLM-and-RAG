The information provided does not explicitly state where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it mentions that the dataset consists of 35,573 images for each of the 12 channels, resulting in a total of 426,876 images. These images were center cropped to an equally sized rectangle and augmented in various ways for the training set. It also states that comparable studies used smaller datasets, while this study used a much larger one. Unfortunately, without additional context, I cannot provide the exact location of the data repository.
