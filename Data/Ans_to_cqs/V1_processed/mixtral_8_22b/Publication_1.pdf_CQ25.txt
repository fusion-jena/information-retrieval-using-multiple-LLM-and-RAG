The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that it is used for event detection and classification within the field of biodiversity monitoring. This involves identifying and categorizing events of interest, such as the presence of certain animal species, based on sensor data. By employing deep learning techniques, the system aims to significantly reduce the volume of data that needs to be manually reviewed by human analysts.
