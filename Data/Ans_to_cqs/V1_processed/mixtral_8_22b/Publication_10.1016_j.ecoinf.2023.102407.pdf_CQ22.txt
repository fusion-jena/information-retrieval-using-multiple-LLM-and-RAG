The authors use four standard evaluation metrics to assess the performance of their Species Distribution Models (SDMs): sensitivity, specificity, the True Skill Statistic (TSS), and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC). Sensitivity measures the proportion of actual positives that were correctly identified, while specificity measures the proportion of negatives that were correctly identified. The True Skill Statistic (TSS) combines both sensitivity and specificity into one metric, providing a more comprehensive measure of classification accuracy. Finally, the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) provides a measure of the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes.
