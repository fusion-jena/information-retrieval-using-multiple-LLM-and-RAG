The paper does not provide information about the availability or location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in their research. Therefore, without additional context or access to the full text of the article, it is impossible to determine where the data repository might be located. Some common repositories for scientific data include Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, and GBIF, but there is no mention of these platforms in the given excerpt.

Based on the references cited in the excerpt, one possible source of related data could be the So2Sat LCZ42 dataset mentioned in the second reference. However, the excerpt does not explicitly state whether this dataset was used in the current study or if it contains the specific data needed for the deep learning pipeline. To find out more about the availability and location of the relevant data, readers would need to consult the full text of the article or contact the authors directly.
