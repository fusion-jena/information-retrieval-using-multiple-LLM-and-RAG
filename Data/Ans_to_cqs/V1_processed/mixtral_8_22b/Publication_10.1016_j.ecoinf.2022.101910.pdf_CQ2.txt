The deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context uses audio data format. This is evident from the fact that BirdNET, which employs a deep neural network, is designed to automatically detect and classify bird vocalizations from sound recordings. Additionally, the paper titled "Parsing birdsong with deep audio embeddings" further supports this claim. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning pipeline discussed here primarily utilizes audio data format.
