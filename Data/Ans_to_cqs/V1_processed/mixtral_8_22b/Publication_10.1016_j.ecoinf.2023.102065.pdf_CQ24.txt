The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it does discuss some aspects related to the development and evaluation of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for automated birdsong recognition.

In terms of handling randomness during model training, one common strategy is using fixed random seeds when initializing weights or shuffling datasets. This ensures reproducibility by making sure that the results obtained from multiple runs of the same experiment remain consistent. Although this specific aspect isn't mentioned in the context, it could be assumed that similar practices might have been followed while developing the CNN models.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of held-out test sets, validation sets, and training sets derived from Random Occurrence Intervals (ROIs) for assessing and improving the performance of the CNN models. By employing separate datasets for training, validating, and testing the models, the impact of randomness due to variations in input data can be minimized. Moreover, the process of padding shorter ROIs to ensure uniformity in length also contributes towards reducing potential biases introduced by variable durations of audio clips.

Lastly, the context highlights the importance of avoiding temporal autocorrelation in validation and test data by placing overlapping ROIs in the training set. This approach helps maintain independence between samples used for evaluating the model's performance and those used for training, thereby mitigating the influence of random factors affecting the distribution of occurrences within the dataset.
