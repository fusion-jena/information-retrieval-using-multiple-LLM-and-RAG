Based on the given context, it appears that an automated deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm was used for soil salinity distribution mapping in Lake Urmia, Iran. However, it is not explicitly stated whether this same model was also used in the development of the groundwater (GW) salinity hazard maps mentioned earlier in Table 5. Therefore, while we can confirm that a CNN model has been utilized in some capacity within the described pipeline, further information would be needed to definitively state which specific deep learning model was employed for generating the GW salinity vulnerability maps.
