Unfortunately, none of the given contexts directly address the issue of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing the effects of different random seed values. However, I can provide some general strategies used to manage randomness in deep learning models:

1. Fixed Random Seeds: To ensure reproducibility, one common strategy is to set fixed random seeds before running experiments or training models. This ensures that any random processes within the code will produce consistent results across multiple runs.

2. Multiple Runs: Another way to account for randomness is to perform multiple runs of the same experiment with different random seeds. By averaging the performance metrics from these runs, it is possible to get a more robust estimate of the model's true performance.

3. Cross-Validation: Using cross-validation techniques like k-fold cross-validation can help reduce the impact of randomness by ensuring that the entire dataset is utilized during both training and testing phases.

4. Regularization Techniques: Applying regularization techniques such as dropout, weight decay, or early stopping can also help mitigate the effects of randomness by preventing overfitting and improving the model's ability to generalize.

5. Ensemble Methods: Combining multiple models trained with different random seeds through ensemble methods can further improve the overall performance and stability of the final prediction.
