The provided context does not directly discuss specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, I can provide some general information about these techniques.

Data annotation is the process of labeling raw data into meaningful categories so that machine learning algorithms can understand and learn from it. In the context of deep learning pipelines, common data annotation techniques include:

1. Bounding Box Annotation: This technique involves drawing boxes around objects within an image to help the model recognize and localize those objects. It is commonly used in object detection tasks.

2. Instance Segmentation: This technique goes beyond bounding boxes by precisely outlining each individual object in an image. It provides pixel-level accuracy and is useful when dealing with overlapping objects or complex scenes.

3. Semantic Segmentation: Unlike instance segmentation, semantic segmentation focuses on classifying every pixel in an image according to its meaning. For example, all pixels belonging to cars would be labeled as 'car', regardless of whether they belong to different car instances.

4. Landmark Annotation: Also known as key point annotation, this technique involves marking specific points on an object to capture its shape or pose. It is often used in facial recognition systems or human body tracking applications.
