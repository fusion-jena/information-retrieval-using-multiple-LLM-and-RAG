The given context does not provide information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. However, based on general practices in deep learning research, it can be assumed that GPU acceleration would have been utilized due to its efficiency in handling large datasets and complex computations involved in training deep learning models. Additionally, the use of libraries such as Caffe mentioned in the references also suggests the possibility of GPU usage since Caffe supports GPU computation. Nevertheless, without explicit mention or details regarding the hardware resources used, this remains an assumption.
