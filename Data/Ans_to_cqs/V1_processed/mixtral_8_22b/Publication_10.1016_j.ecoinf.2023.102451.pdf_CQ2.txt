Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the deep learning pipeline uses image data format. This is evident from several mentions of images throughout the text, including phrases such as "local features from the images," "long-distance relationships within images," and "extracting multi-scale features from the images." Furthermore, the context explicitly states that the proposed framework aims to classify environmental microorganisms using a microscopic image dataset called EMDS-6. Therefore, it can be concluded that the primary data format utilized in this deep learning pipeline is image data.
