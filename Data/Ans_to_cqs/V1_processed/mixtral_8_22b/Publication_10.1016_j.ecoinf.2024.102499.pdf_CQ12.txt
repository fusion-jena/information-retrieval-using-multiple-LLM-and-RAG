The deep learning model used in this study is based on the NASnet architecture (Zoph et al., 2017) with a Faster-rcnn backbone (Ren et al., 2015) implemented in Tensorflow2. This suggests that the authors employed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach for their deep learning model. CNNs are widely used in image recognition tasks due to their ability to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images. In this case, the NASnet architecture provides a method for neural architecture search, which helps optimize the design of the network for specific tasks. Additionally, the use of the Faster-rcnn backbone indicates that the model incorporates object detection capabilities, allowing it to identify and classify individual sharks within the video footage.
