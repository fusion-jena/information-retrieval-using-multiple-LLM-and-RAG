The text does not provide explicit information about which specific deep learning framework was used to build the machine learning model. However, it mentions using a Python implementation of the XGBoostClassifier (Chen and Guestrin, 2016), which suggests that the model might have been built using Python programming language. It should be noted that XGBoost is not a deep learning framework but rather a gradient boosting library designed for efficient use of system resources. Therefore, based on the available information, we cannot determine whether a deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch was used to build the model.
