The text does not provide explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, based on common practices in machine learning projects, some possible postprocessing steps could include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., creating confusion matrices, and visualizing the results. These steps help evaluate the performance of the trained model and understand its strengths and weaknesses.
