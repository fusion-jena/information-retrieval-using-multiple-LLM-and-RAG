Unfortunately, there is no mention or reference to any specific code repositories such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket within the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide the exact location where the deep learning pipeline's code repository is available. It would be best to refer back to the original source material or contact the authors directly for this information.
