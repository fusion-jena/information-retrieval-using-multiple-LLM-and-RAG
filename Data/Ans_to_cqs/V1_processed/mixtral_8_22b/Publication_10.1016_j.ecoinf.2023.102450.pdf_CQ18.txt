The text does not provide explicit information about the specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, it can be inferred from the given data that the mean prediction errors are calculated for various videos, which could indicate that this metric might have been used to evaluate the model's performance during training. Additionally, the use of few-shot learning suggests that the authors may have monitored the model's ability to generalize well even when trained on limited data. Nonetheless, without more detailed information regarding the training process, it cannot be definitively stated what exact strategies were employed to monitor the model performance during training.
