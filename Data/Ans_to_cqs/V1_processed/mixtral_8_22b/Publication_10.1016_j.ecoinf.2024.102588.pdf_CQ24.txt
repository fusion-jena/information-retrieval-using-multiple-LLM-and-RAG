In the given context, there isn't any explicit mention or discussion about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, specifically regarding random seed values. However, some general strategies can be mentioned based on common practices in the field.

Randomness in deep learning pipelines often arises due to factors like weight initialization, batch selection during training, dropout regularization, etc. To manage this randomness and ensure reproducible results, one strategy is setting a fixed random seed value. By doing so, the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers will be generated across different runs, leading to consistent results.

Moreover, it's essential to understand that fixing the random seed might not always be desirable, especially when evaluating the model's performance under various conditions. In such cases, running multiple experiments with different random seeds and averaging the results could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the model's behavior.

Lastly, employing deterministic algorithms wherever possible can also help reduce randomness in the deep learning pipeline. For instance, using a deterministic optimizer instead of stochastic gradient descent can eliminate some sources of randomness.
