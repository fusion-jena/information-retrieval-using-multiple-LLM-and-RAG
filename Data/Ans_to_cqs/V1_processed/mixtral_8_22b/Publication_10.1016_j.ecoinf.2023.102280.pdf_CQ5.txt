The context does not provide specific details about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for bioacoustic applications. However, it mentions that the development of large-scale datasets is infeasible due to the sparsity of vocalisations in these applications. It also refers to a paper by Stowell (2021) titled 'Computational Bioacoustics with Deep Learning: A Review and Roadmap', which might contain further information on the topic. Unfortunately, without access to this paper or additional context, it is impossible to provide a definitive list of datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for bioacoustic applications.
