Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific details on the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general practice, common methods for gathering raw data include using sensors or devices to capture real-time data, conducting surveys or experiments to gather human responses, or utilizing publicly available datasets. In some cases, researchers may also use web scraping techniques to extract data from websites or APIs. Without more specific information about the research being conducted, it is difficult to determine exactly how the data was collected in this case.
