The text provides several examples of data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline for audio data. These include changing the frequency, pitch, and volume of audio signals, shifting, rotating, and zooming in the time and/or frequency domains of spectrograms, and adding additional noise. The Mosaic augmentation technique was also mentioned, which involves merging four original spectrograms into one big input image for model training. This results in sound objects from each spectrogram being placed in a new position in the merged image, losing their vertical position and frequency information. To address this issue, the rainbow mapping technique was developed to encode the frequency information of audio signals in a spectrogram. This involved dividing the spectrogram into five bands along the frequency axis and using a unique gradient colormap for each band to distinguish differences in energy and frequency. Other audio-specific augmentation techniques mentioned include noise mixing and random signal amplitude used in the SILIC, as well as sound mixing with other target signals and/or reverberations.
