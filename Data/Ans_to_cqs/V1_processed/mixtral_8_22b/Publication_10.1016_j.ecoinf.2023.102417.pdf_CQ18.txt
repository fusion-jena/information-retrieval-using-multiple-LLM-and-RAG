The text does not provide explicit details about the strategies used to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions that neural networks can be trained using supervised, semi-supervised, or unsupervised methods. Supervised learning typically involves training models with a large amount of training data consisting of input and target image pairs. Semi-supervised learning allows models to benefit from unlabeled data during training, reducing the need for manual data labeling. Unsupervised learning focuses on finding patterns within the dataset without any prior knowledge of labels.

To evaluate the performance of these models, various metrics can be employed depending on the specific task. For instance, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the curve (AUC) are commonly used for classification tasks. For semantic image segmentation, mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and pixel accuracy are often utilized. Additionally, loss functions play a crucial role in monitoring model performance during training. Cross-entropy loss is frequently used for multi-class classification problems, while binary cross-entropy loss is suitable for binary classification tasks.

However, the given context does not explicitly mention the use of these techniques or other strategies to monitor the model performance during training. Therefore, further information would be required to provide a more precise response.
