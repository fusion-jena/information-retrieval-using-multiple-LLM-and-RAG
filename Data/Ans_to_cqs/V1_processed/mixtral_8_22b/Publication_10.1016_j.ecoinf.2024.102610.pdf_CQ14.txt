The text does not provide explicit information about the specific optimization technique used for selecting the hyperparameters of the model. However, it mentions two common variable elimination techniques for random forests: Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Variable Selection Using Random Forests (VSURF). These techniques help in reducing the number of input features or variables, but do not directly address the optimization of hyperparameters like learning rate, regularization strength, etc. Therefore, without additional context, it cannot be determined whether grid search, random search, or another optimization technique was used for hyperparameter tuning.
