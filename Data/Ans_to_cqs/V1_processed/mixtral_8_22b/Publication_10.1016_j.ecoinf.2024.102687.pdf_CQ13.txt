The deep learning model was fine-tuned using the Adam optimizer initialized with a default learning rate of 0.0001 and a weight decay of 0. The experiments were conducted in PyTorch on 8 x NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. Fine-tuning was performed on the entire model for 100 epochs, with one epoch corresponding to 500 episodic tasks.
