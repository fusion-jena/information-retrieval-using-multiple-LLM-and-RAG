The deep learning model mentioned in this context is built using MATLAB. Specifically, the Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum optimizer is employed for training the model, with some modifications made to the initial learning rate and the maximum number of epochs. On the other hand, the 'classical' machine-learning algorithms such as AB, GB, HB, and LD are executed in Python using the scikit-learn toolbox. However, no specific deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch is explicitly mentioned in this context.
