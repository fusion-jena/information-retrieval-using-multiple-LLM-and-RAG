The article does not provide explicit information about where the code repository for the deep learning pipeline is located. However, it mentions that the model was trained using the Jean Zay supercomputer (IDRIS). This suggests that the authors might have used internal resources for developing and running the code. Therefore, without further information, it cannot be determined if the code repository is publicly accessible on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
