The given text does not provide information about a specific deep learning model being used in the pipeline. Instead, it discusses various aspects such as observer bias correction, lasso-type penalties, mixture modeling using EM algorithms, semi-supervised learning, and fitting individual point process models (PPMs). None of these techniques directly correspond to any particular deep learning architecture like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or Transformers. Therefore, without additional context, I cannot determine what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline.
