The given context does not provide information about specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, based on general knowledge, these are some common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines:

1. Image Classification: Labeling images into categories or classes.
2. Object Detection: Identifying objects within an image and drawing bounding boxes around them.
3. Semantic Segmentation: Assigning each pixel in an image to a class label.
4. Instance Segmentation: Similar to semantic segmentation but different instances of the same object get separate labels.
5. Key Point Detection: Locating key points or landmarks on an object.
6. Text Annotation: Tagging text data with relevant metadata like sentiment, intent, etc.

These techniques help train machine learning algorithms to recognize patterns and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task.
