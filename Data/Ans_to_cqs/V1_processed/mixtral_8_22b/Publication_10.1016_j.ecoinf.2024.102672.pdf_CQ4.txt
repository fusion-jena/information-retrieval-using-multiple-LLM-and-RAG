The text does not provide specific details about the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline beyond mentioning the inclusion of lagged features for time series analysis. Lagging involves shifting the time series back by a specified number of periods, allowing the model to consider past values when making predictions. However, traditional image data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, scaling, etc., are not mentioned in the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed list of these techniques as they are not explicitly stated.
