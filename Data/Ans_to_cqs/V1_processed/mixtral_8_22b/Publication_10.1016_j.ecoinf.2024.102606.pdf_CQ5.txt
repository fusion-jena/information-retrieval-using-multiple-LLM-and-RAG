The study uses two main datasets: one for training and another for benchmarking. For training, a dataset of 2195 annotations was built, which includes 9 species of interest and a category labeled as 'Other'. However, the name of this dataset is not explicitly mentioned in the given information. For benchmarking, the study uses ImageNet, a well-known dataset in the field of deep learning and computer vision. Two versions of Faster R-CNN were created for the benchmark, both using Resnet50 as a backbone and pre-trained on ImageNet. These versions are named Faster R-CNN (640) and Faster R-CNN (1280), based on their respective input dimensions.
