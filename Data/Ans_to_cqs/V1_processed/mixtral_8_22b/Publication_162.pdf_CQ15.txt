The given text does not provide explicit information about the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. However, it can be inferred that some form of optimization technique was employed during training due to the mention of weight initialization and optimization for color images. Typically, deep learning models use optimization algorithms like SGD, Adam, or others to minimize the loss function and update model parameters iteratively. Without further context, it cannot be determined which specific optimization technique was utilized in this case.
