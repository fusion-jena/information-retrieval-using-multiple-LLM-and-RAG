The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it mentions that the study aimed to construct a final ensemble conflict risk model by weight averaging the ten different algorithms as implemented in the biomod2 package. This process involved selecting model runs with a True Skill Statistic (TSS) greater than 0.5 for generating the ensemble model. Additionally, the authors mention that they averaged predictions across three replicated runs for each model. These steps suggest that some form of validation was performed to assess the performance of the models and select those with better accuracy. Nevertheless, without further details regarding the data preprocessing, training, and testing procedures, it is difficult to definitively state what specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
