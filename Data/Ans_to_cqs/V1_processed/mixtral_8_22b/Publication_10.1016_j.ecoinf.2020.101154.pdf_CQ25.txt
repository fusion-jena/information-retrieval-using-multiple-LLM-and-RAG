Based on the given information, it appears that the purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated. However, we can infer from the context that the model is likely being used for predictive or regression tasks. This is suggested by the use of terms such as "prediction accuracy" and "MSE" (Mean Squared Error), which is a common metric for evaluating the performance of regression models. Additionally, the mention of "explanatory variables" indicates that the model is being used to understand the relationship between different factors and some outcome variable. Therefore, while the exact purpose of the model is not clear without additional context, it seems reasonable to conclude that it is being used for predictive modeling or regression analysis.
