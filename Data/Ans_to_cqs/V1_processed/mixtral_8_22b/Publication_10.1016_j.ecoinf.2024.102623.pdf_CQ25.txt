The purpose of the deep learning model described in the given context is for multi-label classification. This is indicated by the use of a sigmoid function in the final layer of the MLP architecture, which enables multi-label classification. Multi-label classification allows for multiple labels or classes to be assigned to a single input, making it suitable for tasks such as predicting the presence of multiple species in a given location.
