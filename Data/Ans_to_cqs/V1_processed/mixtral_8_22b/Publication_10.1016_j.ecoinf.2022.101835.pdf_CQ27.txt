The text does not provide information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide details regarding the method of model serialization or platform selection.

Based on the given context, it appears that the authors focused on developing and optimizing their machine learning models (RF, ANN, and LightGBM) using various libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, and Optuna. They also mentioned evaluating the performance of these algorithms by comparing the loss functions (mean squared error) of the optimized models. However, there are no specific details about how they deployed the trained models after optimization.
