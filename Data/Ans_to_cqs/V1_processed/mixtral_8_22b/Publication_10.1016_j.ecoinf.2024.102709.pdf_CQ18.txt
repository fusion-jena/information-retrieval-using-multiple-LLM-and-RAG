The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of k-fold cross-validation, specifically with k set to 5. This method splits the data into five different training-test sets, allowing the model to be trained on each split separately. The goal is to find the best data split, which is determined by investigating the mean Average Precision (mAP50) values of each model. The higher the mAP50 value, the better the model performs in terms of predicting correct labels. Additionally, the training losses, including the YOLO loss function, are monitored throughout the process. The YOLO loss function consists of three components: box loss, objectness loss, and class loss. Box loss is a regression loss measuring the error in predicted bounding box coordinates and dimensions compared to the ground truth. Objectness loss evaluates whether or not there is an object present within the bounding box, while class loss assesses the accuracy of the detected objects' classes. By monitoring these metrics, researchers can ensure optimal model performance during training.
