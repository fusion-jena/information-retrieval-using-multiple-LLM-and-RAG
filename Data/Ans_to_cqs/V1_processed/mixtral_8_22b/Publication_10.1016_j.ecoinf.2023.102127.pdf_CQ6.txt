The provided context does not directly address the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does discuss some general considerations when working with limited data and biased datasets, which could indirectly relate to preprocessing steps.

In general, preprocessing steps for deep learning models may include:
1. Data Cleaning: Removing irrelevant, redundant, or incorrect data. This might involve handling missing values, removing outliers, or correcting inconsistent entries.
2. Normalization/Standardization: Scaling numeric features to have zero mean and unit variance or between a certain range (like 0-1), ensuring that each feature contributes proportionately to the final output.
3. Feature Engineering: Creating new features from existing ones to better capture patterns in the data. This might involve encoding categorical variables, extracting features from text or images, or creating interaction terms.
4. Splitting Datasets: Dividing the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. This helps evaluate the model's performance on unseen data and prevent overfitting.
5. Handling Class Imbalance: Addressing imbalanced classes by techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or using class weights during training.
