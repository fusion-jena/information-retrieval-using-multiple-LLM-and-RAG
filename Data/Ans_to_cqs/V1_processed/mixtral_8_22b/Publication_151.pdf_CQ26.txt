The given text does not provide information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Instead, it focuses on evaluating DEPP, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, on simulated datasets and discussing its performance, training time, and memory usage. It also mentions the use of five residual blocks for the backbone tree with 200 taxons and one residual block for the remaining dataset to balance performance and training time. Additionally, the text discusses the impact of reducing the embedding size on accuracy and the benefits of using a gap reconstruction model and a weighted approach to improve accuracy.
