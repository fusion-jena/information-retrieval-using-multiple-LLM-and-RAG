The text does not provide explicit details about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the challenges faced due to the scarcity of labeled data and the need for generating training data to target certain species. This suggests that techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection might be relevant to mitigate these issues.

Stratified splitting ensures that each subset of data maintains the same distribution of classes as the overall dataset, which helps maintain class balance when creating training and testing sets. Oversampling and undersampling involve increasing or decreasing the number of instances in a class to achieve balanced representation. These methods can help prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.

Additionally, collecting diverse data can also aid in addressing data bias. By gathering data from various sources, environments, and conditions, the model becomes more robust and generalizable, reducing its susceptibility to biases introduced by limited or homogeneous data.
