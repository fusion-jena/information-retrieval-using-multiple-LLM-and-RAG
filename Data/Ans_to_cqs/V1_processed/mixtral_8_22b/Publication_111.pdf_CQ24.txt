The given context does not directly discuss strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some general practices can be applied to manage randomness in deep learning models. These include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, employing cross-validation or bootstrapping methods to reduce variance due to random sampling, and utilizing ensemble methods to combine multiple models trained with different initializations. Additionally, advanced techniques like Bayesian optimization or hyperparameter tuning can help optimize model parameters and improve robustness against randomness.
