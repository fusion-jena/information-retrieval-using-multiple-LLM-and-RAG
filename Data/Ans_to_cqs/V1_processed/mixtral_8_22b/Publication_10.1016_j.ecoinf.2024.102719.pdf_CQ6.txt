The given context does not provide specific information about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to perform various preprocessing techniques on datasets before feeding them into a model. These may include:

1. Normalization: This involves transforming the dataset so that its features have zero mean and unit variance. It helps in stabilizing the learning process and improving convergence rates during optimization. Common methods used for normalization include min-max scaling, z-score normalization, and decimal scaling.

2. Scaling: Scaling refers to adjusting the range of independent variables or features in a dataset to improve the performance of the model. Techniques like standardization and normalization help bring all features to the same level of magnitude, which can significantly impact the results when using distance-based measures or gradient descent-based optimizers.

3. Cleaning: Dataset cleaning involves handling missing values, removing outliers, and dealing with inconsistent entries. Missing values can be replaced with statistical measures like mean, median, mode, or imputation techniques. Outliers can be detected using visualizations or statistical tests and removed if necessary. Consistent entries ensure that the dataset maintains integrity and reliability.

While these preprocessing steps are commonly applied, they depend heavily on the nature of the dataset and the requirements of the specific deep learning task. Therefore, it is essential to understand the characteristics of the dataset and choose appropriate preprocessing techniques accordingly.
