The text does not provide explicit details about specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions using remote sensing images and semantic labels of land cover classes, which were then divided into smaller image blocks of 32 x 32 pixels for input during the training process. It can be inferred that these remote sensing images and corresponding semantic labels serve as the dataset for the deep learning pipeline.
