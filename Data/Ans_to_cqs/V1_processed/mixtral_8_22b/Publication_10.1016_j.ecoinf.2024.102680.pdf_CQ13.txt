The hyperparameters used in the deep learning models vary depending on the specific algorithm employed. For instance, the original YOLOv8 network uses the C2f module for feature extraction, but it has limitations in obtaining comprehensive and rich feature information due to its use of a split operation on features after convolution. Different object detection algorithms, such as ResNet50, Two-stage detector, Single-stage detector, Transformer detector, and others, were trained using default parameters preset in the MMDetection framework until they fully converged. These hyperparameters include the optimizer and learning rate. Detailed hyperparameter settings for different object detection algorithms are presented in Table 2. Some examples of optimizers mentioned are Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adaptive Moment Estimation Weight Decay (AdamW).
