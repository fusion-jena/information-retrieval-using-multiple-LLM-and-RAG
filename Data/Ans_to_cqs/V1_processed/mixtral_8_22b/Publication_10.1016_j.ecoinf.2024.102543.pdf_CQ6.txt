During the preprocessing phase of preparing a dataset for training a deep learning model, several techniques are employed to ensure consistency and richness in the data. Auto-orientation ensures that all images have a consistent orientation. Resizing is applied to standardize image sizes; in this case, all images were resized to 640 x 640 pixels. Tiling and filtering may also be used to further process the images. An important aspect of preprocessing involves annotating the data, which provides valuable information about the content of the images. In this scenario, a 90% annotation threshold was maintained. Data augmentation plays a significant role in enhancing the diversity of the dataset. For instance, by applying random saturation adjustments to each training example, the output per example was doubled, thereby increasing the variety within the training dataset.
