Unfortunately, based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. However, the context mentions the use of the GBIF database, which stands for Global Biodiversity Information Facility. This could potentially be the source of the data used in the pipeline. You can access the GBIF website at <https://www.gbif.org/>. Additionally, the context also mentions that a subset of 330 videos was manually annotated and provided for training and validation purposes. But again, there is no direct link provided for this dataset within the given context.
