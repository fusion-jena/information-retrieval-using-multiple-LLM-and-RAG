The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, based on the information available, it appears that the model may be used for predicting infectious diseases for biopreparedness and response. This is suggested by the title of the cited paper "Predicting infectious disease for biopreparedness and response: a systematic review of machine learning and deep learning approaches" (Keshavamurthy et al., 2022). Additionally, the use of two common variable elimination techniques for random forests - Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Variable Selection Using Random Forests (VSURF) - indicates that the model likely involves some form of feature selection or dimensionality reduction. Without further context, however, it is difficult to determine the specific type of deep learning model being used (e.g., convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network, etc.) or its exact purpose within the broader framework of infectious disease prediction.
