Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about specific preprocessing steps such as data cleaning, normalization, or scaling prior to training the deep learning models mentioned. However, some relevant details can be inferred regarding the handling of input data and its preparation for training.

In the case of the MLP model, the input data consists of learned features extracted from a diffusion model, resulting in a vector of size 512. This suggests that feature extraction might have been performed as part of the preprocessing step. Furthermore, Batch Normalization is applied during the training process, which helps standardize the inputs for each mini-batch, potentially reducing internal covariate shift and improving convergence rates.

For the decoder model, no explicit preprocessing steps are mentioned. However, the input data is processed through multiple layers of varying sizes, indicating that the raw data may have undergone dimensionality reduction or transformation into a suitable format for the model architecture.

Overall, while the context does not provide comprehensive details on traditional preprocessing steps like data cleaning, normalization, or scaling, it does suggest that feature extraction and dimensionality reduction could be considered as part of the preprocessing pipeline for these particular deep learning models.
