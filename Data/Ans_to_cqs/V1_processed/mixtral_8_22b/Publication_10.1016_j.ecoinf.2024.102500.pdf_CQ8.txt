The given context does not provide any specific details about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that the study uses Python libraries such as scikit-learn and Keras for building the models. Therefore, it cannot be determined from this context alone where the code repository is located. However, it can be suggested that researchers often share their code repositories on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. To find out if there is a publicly accessible code repository for this particular study, one could look for relevant links in the published paper or contact the authors directly.
