The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for creating fire risk maps. However, it does discuss the use of various modeling techniques such as artificial neural networks, deep learning, and logistic regression. These methods often require labeled datasets for training models. In general, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. Bounding boxes are typically used for object detection tasks, where the goal is to identify the presence and location of objects within an image. Semantic segmentation involves labeling each pixel in an image with its corresponding class or category, which can help distinguish between different land cover types or vegetation densities. Instance segmentation combines both object detection and semantic segmentation, allowing for individual instances of objects to be identified and classified separately. While the context does not provide explicit information on the specific data annotation techniques used, these general techniques may have been applied during the creation of the fire risk maps.
