Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide a direct link to the data repository for the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given text. It would require additional details about the specific study, authors, or publication to locate the relevant dataset. However, based on common practices, datasets are often shared through repositories like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. To find this particular dataset, one could search these platforms using keywords from the paper or contact the authors directly for more information.
