None of the provided sources directly address the issue of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some general strategies can be employed to manage this type of randomness. One common approach is to set a fixed random seed value before running any code involving random processes, which ensures reproducibility of results across different runs or machines. Another strategy involves using techniques like cross-validation or bootstrapping to estimate the performance of a model while accounting for variations due to randomness. Additionally, ensemble methods, where multiple models are trained independently and their predictions combined, can help reduce the impact of randomness on overall performance.
