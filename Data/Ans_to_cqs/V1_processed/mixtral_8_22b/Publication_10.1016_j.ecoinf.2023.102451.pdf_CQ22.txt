The performance of the deep learning model EMViT-Net is evaluated using several metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy. These metrics are commonly used to assess the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms. Precision is defined as the ratio of true positives to all positive predictions made by the model. Recall, also known as sensitivity, is calculated as the number of correct positive predictions divided by the total number of actual positives. The F1-score is a measure of both precision and recall, providing a single score that balances both factors. Accuracy is determined by dividing the sum of true positives and true negatives by the total number of instances. In this case, the EMViT-Net model achieved a test accuracy of 67.62%.
