Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does state that the experiments were conducted on a small-sized dataset without data augmentation. Furthermore, the context discusses the application of deep learning methods in image recognition, specifically referring to the CNN architecture known as AlexNet, which was proposed by Alex Krizhevsky and won the 2012 ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge. This suggests that the authors might be working with similar types of datasets, but no concrete information about the exact datasets used is available within the provided context.
