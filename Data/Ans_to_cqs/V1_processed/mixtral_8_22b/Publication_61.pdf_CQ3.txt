The paper does not explicitly mention any specific data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it discusses the importance of building their own dataset due to the lack of existing information. They focus on creating a dataset from the Tehuacán-Cuicatlán Valley in Mexico, which includes various environmental conditions like different daylight conditions and seasons. Additionally, they use a segmentation and crop method based on Fourier transformations and a K-means algorithm to generate regions of interest in the images before training a CNN for classification tasks.
