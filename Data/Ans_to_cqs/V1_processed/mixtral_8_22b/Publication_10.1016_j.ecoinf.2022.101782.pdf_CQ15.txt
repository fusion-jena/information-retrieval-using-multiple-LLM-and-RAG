The deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context utilizes the ADAM optimizer with a learning rate of 10. Additionally, image augmentation techniques such as horizontal flipping, counterclockwise shearing, and random zooming are employed to improve the performance of the model. These techniques help prevent overfitting and enhance the generalization capabilities of the model. Furthermore, the input tensors are normalized to ImageNet mean values, and the pixels are rescaled within the range of [0, 1] to ensure consistent input data.
