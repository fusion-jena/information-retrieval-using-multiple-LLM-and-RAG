Based on the given context, it is not explicitly mentioned which specific framework was used to build the deep learning models such as the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. However, it does mention that Bayesian Optimization was implemented using the GPyOpt library, which is a Python library for Bayesian Optimization. This suggests that Python might have been used as the programming language for building these models. Nevertheless, without further context or explicit mention of the framework used, we cannot definitively determine whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other deep learning framework was utilized.
