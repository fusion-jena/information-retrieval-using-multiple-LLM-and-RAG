In addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets or strata based on certain criteria, ensuring that each subset maintains the same distribution of classes as the original dataset. This technique helps prevent class imbalance issues when partitioning the dataset into training and testing sets.

Oversampling is another method used to handle class imbalances in datasets. It works by duplicating examples from the minority class until it reaches a balance with the majority class. Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is one popular approach for generating synthetic samples instead of simply replicating existing ones.

Undersampling, conversely, reduces the number of instances in the majority class to match the size of the minority class. Random under-sampling is a simple way to achieve this, but it may lead to loss of valuable information. More sophisticated methods like NearMiss and Condensed Nearest Neighbor (CNN) rule help maintain important characteristics while reducing the majority class size.

Diverse data collection aims to gather a wide range of representative samples to ensure that the model generalizes well across various scenarios. In the case of limited availability of ence data for training, researchers might seek out additional acoustic reference data from other domains and fine-tune their models with specific region-of-interest (ROI) data.

Data augmentation is also commonly applied to increase the amount of training data artificially. By applying transformations such as rotation, scaling, flipping, or cropping, new variations of existing samples are generated. For sound classification tasks, data augmentation could involve splitting merged wave files and adding them together sample-wise, creating new combinations of sounds.

These techniques collectively contribute to mitigating data biases and improving the performance of deep learning models. However, selecting the appropriate strategy depends on factors such as the nature of the dataset, the problem being addressed, and the computational resources available.
