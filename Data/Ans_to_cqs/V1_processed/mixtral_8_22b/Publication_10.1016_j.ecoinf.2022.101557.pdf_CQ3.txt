The text does not explicitly mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does discuss the labor-intensive nature of data collection and annotation for training models. It also mentions the possibility of using already annotated data for building AI models. Furthermore, the text suggests generating additional synthetic samples from annotated datasets using generative adversarial models like those proposed by Fang et al. (2019) and Li (2019). This approach aims to create realistic augmentations of the original dataset, potentially increasing its size and diversity. Nevertheless, it is important to note that even generative methods require some initial annotated data and could introduce artifacts in the generated data.
