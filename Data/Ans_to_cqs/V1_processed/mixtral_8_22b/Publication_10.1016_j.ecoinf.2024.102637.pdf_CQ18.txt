Based on the given information, it appears that the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves several key components. Firstly, the learning rate is set to 0.00005, which determines how much the weights should be adjusted with respect to the loss gradient during backpropagation. This value affects the speed and stability of convergence. Secondly, the Adam optimizer is utilized, which is an extension of stochastic gradient descent that computes adaptive learning rates for different parameters. This helps in achieving faster convergence and improved performance. Thirdly, the number of epochs is set to 200, indicating the number of times the algorithm will work through the entire training dataset. Lastly, the cross-entropy loss function is employed, which measures the difference between predicted probabilities and actual labels. By monitoring these metrics throughout the training process, one can evaluate the model's performance and make necessary adjustments if needed.
