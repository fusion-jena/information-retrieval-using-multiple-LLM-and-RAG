The information provided does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the given context, we can infer that various types of data were utilized for this study. These include Digital Elevation Model (DEM), Slope (SLOP), Soil (SOIL), and Vegetation type data which are likely in raster format due to their spatial nature. Other data mentioned such as Average Annual Human Density, Economic Density, Land Use Intensity, Precipitation, Temperature, Evapotranspiration, Elevation, Slope, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Vegetation Type Number could be in numerical or tabular format like CSV. The sources of these data also suggest a mix of formats including web services, databases, and possibly APIs. Unfortunately, without more specific details about the deep learning pipeline, it is impossible to definitively state what data formats are used.
