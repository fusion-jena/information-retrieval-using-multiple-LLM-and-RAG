The deep learning model described uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. The specific hyperparameters mentioned include a kernel size of 3, a stride of 1, and a dropout rate of 50%. The training process involved an initial learning rate of 10, which was halved every 20 rounds to optimize performance. Additionally, the momentum was set at 0.9. However, the exact optimizer used is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
