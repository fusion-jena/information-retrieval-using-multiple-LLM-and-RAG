The deep learning model mentioned in the given context uses two main frameworks: TensorFlow and Scikit-learn. These frameworks were utilized to implement the classification methods, including Deep Neural Networks (DNN), which had a LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) block added to its architecture. The entire implementation was done in Python.
