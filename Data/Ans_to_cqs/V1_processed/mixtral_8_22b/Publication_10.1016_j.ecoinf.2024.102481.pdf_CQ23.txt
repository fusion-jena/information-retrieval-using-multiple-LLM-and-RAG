Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does state that the model performance was evaluated using the confusion matrix with various metrics such as Cohenâ€™s kappa coefficient, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence. This suggests that some form of validation or testing was performed on the model. Additionally, the text mentions that Random Forests (RFs) are widely applied for both classification and regression tasks, which implies that they could potentially be used for validating the model. Nevertheless, without more detailed information about the methodology employed, it cannot be definitively stated what specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
