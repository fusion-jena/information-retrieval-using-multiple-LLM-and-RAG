The text does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model. However, it mentions that the model hyperparameters were tuned using Bayesian optimization, focusing on reducing the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the predictions. The search space of optimal hyperparameters was defined by the ranges of "mtry" (number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split), "min.node.size" (minimum size of terminal nodes), and "num.trees" (number of trees to grow). These hyperparameters correspond to the terminology used in the R package "ranger." It is important to note that these hyperparameters are related to random forest models rather than deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot provide the specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model based on the given context.
