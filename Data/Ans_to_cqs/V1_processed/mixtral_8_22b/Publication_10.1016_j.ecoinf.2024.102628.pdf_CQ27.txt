The text does not provide explicit details about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, it mentions the use of the fast.ai platform for training and validating models. The fast.ai library provides functionalities for saving and loading models, which could be used for model serialization. Additionally, since the fast.ai platform was used for both training and validation, it can be inferred that the same platform might have been used for deploying the trained model. Nevertheless, without specific information regarding the deployment process, it cannot be confirmed how exactly the trained deep learning model was deployed.
