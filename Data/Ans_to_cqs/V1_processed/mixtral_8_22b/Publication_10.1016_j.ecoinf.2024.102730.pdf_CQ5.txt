The given context does not provide specific information about the datasets used in any deep learning pipelines. However, it can be inferred that some studies have utilized remote sensing data such as MODIS and Landsat for monitoring vegetation phenology and estimating grassland biomass. Additionally, there is mention of a dataset containing chimpanzee faces captured from video footage in the wild. Other papers discuss methods for plant species identification and automated facial recognition for wildlife, which may involve their own respective datasets. Unfortunately, without explicit details regarding the datasets used in each study, it cannot be definitively stated which datasets were employed in these deep learning pipelines.
