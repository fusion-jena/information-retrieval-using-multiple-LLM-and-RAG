The text does not provide information on the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the estimates of percent ground cover from manually segmented photos were not strongly correlated with field-measured fuel loads, suggesting that some form of correlation or agreement metric may have been used to compare these values. Additionally, the text notes that the results were statistically significant, indicating that hypothesis testing may also have been employed. Without further information, it cannot be determined whether other common evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall were utilized.
