Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text only mentions that a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model was used for generating synthetic connectivity data, but it does not go into detail regarding the configuration of the model. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this query based on the available context.
