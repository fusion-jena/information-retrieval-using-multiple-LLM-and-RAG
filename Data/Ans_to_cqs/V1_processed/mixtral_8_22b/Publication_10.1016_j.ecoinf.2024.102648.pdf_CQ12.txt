Based on the given context, it appears that the deep learning model used in this study is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). However, there is no explicit mention of other specific types of deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. Therefore, we cannot definitively state that any of these models were used in the pipeline. It is important to note that ANNs are a broad category of neural networks that can be structured in various ways depending on the problem being addressed. In summary, while the text does not provide enough information to determine if more specialized deep learning architectures like CNNs, RNNs, or Transformers were used, it does indicate that an ANN was part of the modeling process.
