Based on the given context, there isn't any direct mention of specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does provide some clues about how the authors approached their modeling process. They divided their dataset into training and validation sets in a ratio of 3:1 and used five modeling methods: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). After selecting the model with the highest accuracy, they estimated the rice Leaf Chlorophyll Content (LCC) and crop coverage degree in the entire study area. This suggests that the authors might have used the performance of the model on the validation set as one of the criteria to decide when the training is complete. Typically, training continues until the validation loss stops improving or starts increasing, indicating overfitting. But without explicit information, it cannot be confirmed if these exact criteria were applied in this case.
