The experiments were conducted using 8 x NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPUs. Fine-tuning was performed on the entire model for 100 epochs, with one epoch corresponding to 500 episodic tasks. The estimation of the energy consumption related to the training of the models was calculated using the Python package CodeCarbon, which corresponds to the sum of CPU energy, GPU energy, and RAM energy in kilowatt-hours (kWh).
