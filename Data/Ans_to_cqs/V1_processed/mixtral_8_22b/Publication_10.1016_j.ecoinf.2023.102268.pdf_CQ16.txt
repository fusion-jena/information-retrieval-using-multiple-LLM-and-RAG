Based on the provided information, it appears that the final classification model, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a cubic polynomial kernel, was trained using the ResNet-50 fc1000 activations of the full training dataset. However, there is no explicit mention of the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.

Typically, in machine learning models like this one, training can be considered complete when certain conditions are met. These conditions often include reaching a minimum error rate, achieving a stable validation accuracy, or when the validation loss plateaus. In some cases, early stopping may also be employed to prevent overfitting, where training stops if the performance on the validation set does not improve after a certain number of epochs.

Unfortunately, without more detailed information about the specific training process used in this case, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the exact criteria used to determine when training was complete.
