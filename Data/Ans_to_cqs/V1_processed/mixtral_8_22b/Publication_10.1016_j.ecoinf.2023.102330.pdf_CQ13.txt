The provided context does not contain specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. However, it mentions that a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was used for the automatic detection of Northern Bobwhite Colinus virginianus covey calls (Nolan et al., 2022). This CNN was trained on covey call spectrogram data collected separately from various locations in Georgia and Alabama, USA. The model was designed to detect and localize all covey calls per ARU (Acoustic Recording Unit) during the recording period and note their associated time and peak power (dB). It employed a conservative score threshold of 0.95 or higher for classifying positive bobwhite detections, which aligns with similar studies (SiroviÄ‡, 2021; Ruff et al., 2020). Unfortunately, without further details regarding the training process, I cannot provide specific hyperparameter values used in the deep learning model.
