The text does not provide explicit information about specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it mentions that collecting and identifying hundreds to thousands of individually labeled pictures is necessary to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In captivity settings, large labeled image datasets can be collected by temporarily isolating the animals in enclosures separated from the rest of the group while filming or photographing them. This implies that some form of labeling or tagging is being done to associate the images with the correct individual animals. Additionally, the text discusses the use of RFID technology to gather large amounts of automatically labeled data, suggesting that RFID tags may be used to help automate the data annotation process.
