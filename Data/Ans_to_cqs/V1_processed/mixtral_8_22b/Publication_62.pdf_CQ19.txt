The information provided does not explicitly state which specific deep learning framework was used to build the models. However, it is mentioned that the code used to define and train the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be found in their Mathematica notebooks (Suppl. materials 1, 3, 2, 4). Therefore, we can infer that they likely used Wolfram Language, the programming language built into Mathematica, to develop their deep learning models.
