The text does not provide information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions various sources of data such as WorldClim for climate data, Copernicus program for DEM, hydrogeological map of the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources for soil type, OpenStreetMap initiative for vector data on roads and hunting, and ESA CCI land cover maps for landscape metrics. However, it does not specify any specific data repository for the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not have enough information to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
