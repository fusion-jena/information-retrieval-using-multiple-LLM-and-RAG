The provided context does not directly address the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it does discuss the use of deep learning techniques in analyzing generated data within smart farming systems.

In general, handling randomness in deep learning pipelines often involves setting fixed seeds for reproducibility or using techniques like cross-validation, bootstrapping, or ensemble methods to account for variability due to random initialization or stochastic processes during training. Additionally, hyperparameter tuning can help optimize model performance despite inherent randomness.

However, without more specific information about the deep learning pipeline used in this context, I cannot provide a detailed strategy tailored to the given scenario.
