In the given context, there isn't explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer some possible methods based on the references cited in the text.

One reference mentions the use of motion detection cameras for capturing video footage of animals [1]. This suggests that sensor technology, specifically motion detection cameras, could be employed for gathering visual data in wildlife conservation studies. Another study discusses arboreal camera trapping, which involves placing cameras high up in trees to capture images of birds and other tree-dwelling species [2]. This further supports the idea that sensor devices like cameras are being used for data collection.

Additionally, one of the papers focuses on satellite imagery analysis for scene classification [3], indicating that publicly available datasets such as satellite images might also play a role in providing input data for deep learning applications.

Lastly, another paper discusses the use of cloud computing services like Google Cloud Dataflow for extracting features from image data [4]. Although not directly related to raw data collection, it does suggest that researchers may utilize existing tools and platforms for processing and managing large volumes of data generated through various means, including those mentioned above.

Overall, while the exact methods for collecting raw data aren't explicitly stated in the provided context, we can surmise that techniques such as sensor devices (like motion detection cameras), publicly accessible datasets (such as satellite imagery), and possibly even traditional survey methods could potentially contribute to the initial stages of the deep learning pipeline.
