The authors have not explicitly mentioned any specific techniques used to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model. However, they did use two different datasets - the PlantVillage dataset and the Dhan-Shomadhan dataset - which can be considered diverse datasets. They evaluated their proposed BEiT (12 M) model on both datasets and presented the results separately. Additionally, they compared their proposed model with other existing deep learning and base ViT models using both noise-added and noise-free situations. By doing so, they demonstrated the robustness and adaptability of their model across various scenarios. Although it cannot be confirmed without explicit mention, one could infer that some form of cross-validation might have been implemented due to the nature of the experiments conducted. Nevertheless, further details regarding stratified splitting or other specific methods to ensure generalizability are not available within the provided context.
