The provided context does not mention any specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it discusses various projection methodologies utilized in ecological modeling, including regression-based models, machine learning techniques like Maxent, and deep learning strategies like neural networks. It also mentions the increasing use of anthropogenic variables in modeling to assess the impact of human activities on species habitat use. Furthermore, the context describes the screening process, meta-data coding, and data synthesis methods employed in the study. Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot determine which datasets were used in the deep learning pipeline.
