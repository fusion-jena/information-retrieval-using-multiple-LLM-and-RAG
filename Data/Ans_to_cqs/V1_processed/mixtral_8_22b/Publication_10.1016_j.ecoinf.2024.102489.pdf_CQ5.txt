The text does not provide explicit information on the use of any standard datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of high spatial resolution satellite image data, specifically MOD09A1 dataset, which is derived from MODIS products. This dataset is synthesized by selecting the best quality observation surface reflectance of the Terra and Aqua sensors within eight days. It has the same spatial and temporal resolution as the MODIS LAI product, without geometric errors, and can exclude pixels such as cloud pollution and cloud shadows using QC and state layers. Additionally, the table provides information about other satellite datasets used in the study, including Landsat-8, GF-1, and Sentinel-2A. These datasets are likely used in the deep learning pipeline for tasks related to land cover classification or vegetation index estimation.
