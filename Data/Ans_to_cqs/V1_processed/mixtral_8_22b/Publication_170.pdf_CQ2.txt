Based on the given context, it appears that the study primarily focuses on image data format for the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, the authors mention using a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) model trained on image datasets. They also compare their results with other studies that used similar image datasets. Therefore, it can be inferred that the primary data format used in this study is images. However, there is no explicit mention of any other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV being used in the deep learning pipeline.
