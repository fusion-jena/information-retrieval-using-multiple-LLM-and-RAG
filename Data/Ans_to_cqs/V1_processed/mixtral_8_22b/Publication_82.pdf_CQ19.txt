In this study, the authors utilized their own fork of Caffe (Jia et al., 2014) to conduct all the experiments. Caffe is a fast, open-source framework for deep learning that supports various architectures like AlexNet and GoogLeNet, which were employed in this research. Therefore, the primary framework used to build the deep learning models in this work is Caffe.
