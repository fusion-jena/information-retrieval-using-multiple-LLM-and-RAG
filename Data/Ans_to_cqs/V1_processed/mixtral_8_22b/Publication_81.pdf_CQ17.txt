Regularization methods are techniques used to prevent overfitting in deep learning models. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the noise or random fluctuations in the training data instead of the underlying pattern, resulting in poor generalization to new data. Regularization helps to reduce this issue by adding a penalty term to the loss function, discouraging complex models and promoting simpler ones. Some common regularization methods include:

1. Dropout: This method randomly drops out neurons during training, effectively creating a thinned network. It prevents any single neuron from having too much influence on the output and encourages the network to distribute its weights evenly among all neurons.

2. L2 Regularization (also known as weight decay): This method adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights to the loss function. By penalizing large weights, it encourages smaller, more distributed representations, reducing the risk of overfitting.

3. Early Stopping: This method involves monitoring the validation error during training and stopping the training process once the validation error starts increasing. This prevents the model from continuing to fit the training data beyond what is necessary, thus avoiding overfitting.

4. Elastic Net: This method combines both L1 and L2 regularization, providing a balance between feature selection and shrinkage. It allows for automatic feature selection and promotes sparsity in the learned representation.

In the given context, the authors use Elastic Net to prevent overfitting in their deep learning pipeline. They mention that Elastic Net improves the generalization ability of their proposed model and solves the overfitting problem encountered when working with small datasets. Additionally, they note that Elastic Net provides sparse connections, saving training time, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data like genetic characteristics of species.
