The text does not explicitly state what specific data format was used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that deep learning models can be applied to various types of data including images, sounds, and time series data. It also states that while the use of deep learning in ecology is increasing, most studies focus on image and sound data classification. Therefore, it can be inferred that the deep learning pipeline described here could potentially involve any of those data formats, depending on the specific application.
