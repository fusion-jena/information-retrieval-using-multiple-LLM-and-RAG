The paper does not provide information on the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The focus of the paper appears to be on the application of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) for semantic segmentation of boreal forest ground cover vegetation composition from nadir photographs, rather than the optimization of the underlying deep learning models themselves.
