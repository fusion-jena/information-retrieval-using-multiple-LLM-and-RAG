The text does not provide information about any specific deep learning model or its development process. However, it discusses the issue of sampling bias in Species Distribution Models (SDMs) and how this affects their performance. To address this problem, several correction methods are mentioned. These include transforming the model input data using four different approaches based on whether they modify the presence dataset or the background dataset, and if they operate in geographical or environmental spaces. One method involves modifying the distribution of the presence dataset towards a uniform distribution, while another builds the background set according to a selection bias reflecting the same sampling bias. While these techniques help improve the performance of SDMs, they require a large number of presence sites, which may not always be available due to factors like species rarity or insufficient species records. Therefore, despite efforts to enhance the robustness and applicability of SDMs, limitations persist due to inherent challenges in obtaining diverse and representative datasets.
