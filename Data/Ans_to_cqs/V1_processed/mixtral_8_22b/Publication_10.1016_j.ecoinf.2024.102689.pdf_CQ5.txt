The provided context does not explicitly mention specific datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in the deep learning pipelines discussed. However, it does highlight some unique datasets created by various research teams for their studies. For instance, Ferreira et al. (2020) developed a program that autonomously collects training data and generates training datasets for their work on small bird individual recognition. Another example is the creation of the Arcface_Mask dataset mentioned but without further details about its content. Additionally, there is a reference to a high-resolution monitoring system for fish length and catch numbers using deep learning, which likely involves a custom dataset tailored to this application. Therefore, while no well-known standard datasets were directly referenced, these examples demonstrate how researchers often create specialized datasets to meet the requirements of their specific projects.
