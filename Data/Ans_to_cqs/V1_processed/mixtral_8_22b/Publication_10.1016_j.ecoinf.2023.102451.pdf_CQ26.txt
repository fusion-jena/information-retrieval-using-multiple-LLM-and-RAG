Some preprocessing steps like data augmentation and normalization are performed to address the diversity of training data and data imbalance problems in classification tasks. Data augmentation involves creating new samples by applying random but realistic transformations to the existing data, such as rotations, translations, or flips. Normalization scales the input data so that it falls within a specific range, typically between 0 and 1, which helps improve the convergence speed and stability of the learning algorithm. While stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, they could potentially be used alongside data augmentation and normalization to further mitigate data bias and imbalance issues.
