Based on the given context, it appears there isn't any direct information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, we can infer some details about the type of data being collected and processed.

The text mentions a crawling tool developed to gather historical and near real-time data from different SRS products. These data include vital parameters like reflectance, Aerosol Optical Thickness (Kd940), and Chlorophyll-a concentrations. The data sources mentioned are the European Space Agency (ESA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

The project also involves collecting water quality data from public APIs of major space agencies using an innovative satellite data collection tool. This tool provides historical and current data insights, creating an organized and coherent time series of varied variables obtained by Satellite Remote Sensing (SRS) services.

One of the key components of this tool focuses on acquiring satellite imagery for predefined geospatial coordinates. The text specifically mentions the use of the spectrometer Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) that measures solar radiation reflected by the Earth in 21 spectral bands at a spatial resolution of 300m.

However, without more specific information about the deep learning pipeline used in this project, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the exact data annotation techniques employed.
