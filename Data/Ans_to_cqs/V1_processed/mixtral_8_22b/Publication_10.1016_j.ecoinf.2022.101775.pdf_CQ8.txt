The given context does not provide information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The context only provides details about the optimization of the regularized cost function using stochastic gradient descent, embedding layers in deep neural networks, and various references related to machine learning and data science. Therefore, it is not possible to determine from this context where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is located.
