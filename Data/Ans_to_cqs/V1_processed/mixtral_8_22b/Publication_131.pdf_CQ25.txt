The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is classification. Specifically, it is designed to classify different types of anuran calls. The model uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are commonly employed for image recognition tasks. In this case, they are applied to mel-spectrogram images derived from audio signals. The goal is to create a robust training set by applying various transformations to the original audio samples, such as time stretching, pitch shifting, and adding noise. This process, known as data augmentation, helps improve the performance and generalizability of the model. The CNN architecture includes three convolution layers with increasing numbers of output filters (32, 64, and 128 respectively), all using a kernel size of 3x3. Following the convolution layers, there is a fully connected layer with 512 neurons and a softmax layer for multi-class classification. The model is trained using 80% of the available samples and tested on the remaining 20%, ensuring a balanced distribution of classes within both sets.
