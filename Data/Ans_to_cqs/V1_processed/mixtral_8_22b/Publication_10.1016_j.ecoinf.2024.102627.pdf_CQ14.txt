The text does not provide explicit details about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, it mentions that the hyperparameter lambda (位) was chosen such that the average species assemblage size E[|S位(X)|] is minimized, or equivalently, lambda is maximized, subject to the constraint that the average error rate is lower than an epsilon objective (系). This process is referred to as conformal prediction in machine learning. The value of epsilon (系) is explicitly stated as being set to 0.03. Unfortunately, there is no mention of whether techniques like grid search or random search were used to find the optimal values for these hyperparameters.
