The paper titled "Object Retrieval with Deep Convolutional" by Mohedano et al. (2017) suggests that the authors use a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) in their proposed method for object retrieval. This can be inferred from both the title of the paper and its abstract, which mentions using deep convolutional features for image representation. Additionally, another source, Petrovska et al. (2020), discusses deep learning for feature extraction in remote sensing, specifically mentioning the application of CNNs for aerial scene classification. However, it should be noted that without further information about the specific pipeline mentioned in the query, we cannot definitively state that a CNN is being used.
