The given context does not provide information about which specific frameworks were used to build the deep learning models mentioned in the text. The paper by Girshick et al. (2014) discusses rich feature hierarchies for accurate object detection and semantic segmentation but does not mention any particular deep learning framework. Similarly, other papers cited in the context do not explicitly state the use of a specific deep learning framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine which frameworks were used to build the deep learning models.
