Based on the given information, it appears that the deep learning models mentioned are primarily being used for image classification tasks. These models are designed to classify images into specific categories or classes, such as identifying different bird species from their images. Some examples include recognizing endemic birds, detecting birds in images, and distinguishing between various bird species. However, without more explicit details about each model's intended use case, it cannot be definitively stated what the exact purpose of every deep learning model is.
