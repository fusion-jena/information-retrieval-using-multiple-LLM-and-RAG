Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in the deep learning pipelines discussed. However, one dataset mentioned is related to bird species identification based on their vocalizations or calls. This dataset consists of recordings of 14 different bird species collected by the Central Poultry Development Organization (CPDO) in Bhubaneswar, India, using a digital recorder and a unidirectional microphone. The dataset was processed through the Mel spectrogram. It should be noted that while CNN-based architectures are useful for image-related tasks, they may not be suitable for audio domains. Additionally, several studies have utilized pre-trained models like transformers for multi-label classification tasks across various applications.
