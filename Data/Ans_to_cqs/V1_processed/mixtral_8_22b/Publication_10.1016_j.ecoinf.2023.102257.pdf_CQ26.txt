The provided context does not directly discuss specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it does mention the use of modern machine learning (ML) methods to perform various tasks, including determining whether an animal is present in an image, which is a binary classification task. This task can be accomplished via machine learning to filter out false detections from a dataset.

Some of the mentioned techniques used to predict whether an image is empty include measurement of differences between consecutive images, convolutional neural networks, and ensemble learning. Additionally, object detection models that localize target objects within an image can be used to filter empty images. While these techniques do not specifically address data bias, they contribute to improving the accuracy and efficiency of the data processing pipeline by reducing the number of false positives and negatives.

To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, one could consider implementing techniques like stratified splitting, where the dataset is divided into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes. Oversampling involves duplicating examples from the minority class, while undersampling removes examples from the majority class to balance the dataset. Lastly, collecting diverse data helps ensure that the trained model performs well across various scenarios and reduces potential biases introduced by limited or skewed datasets.
