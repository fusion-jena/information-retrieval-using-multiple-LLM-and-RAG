The given context does not provide information about the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions that the study uses a regression tree algorithm and provides details about the input data sources such as GEDI, Landsat, and SRTM data. Additionally, it discusses the selection criteria for the training and validation data, including the use of power beam mode, nighttime collection, and exclusion of observations during the leaf-off season in temperate and boreal forests. Furthermore, the context includes information about the validation results of Potapov30m using ALS data, which shows a mean error (ME) of -3.8 m, root mean square error (RMSE) of 9.07 m, and mean absolute error (MAE) of 6.36 m. Nevertheless, without further information regarding the modeling process or the evaluation metrics used during training, it is impossible to determine the exact strategy employed to monitor the model performance during this phase.
