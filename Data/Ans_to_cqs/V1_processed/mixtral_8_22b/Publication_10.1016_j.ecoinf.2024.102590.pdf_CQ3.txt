Based on the given context, it is not explicitly stated what specific data annotation techniques were used in the deep learning pipeline. However, there are some clues that suggest possible techniques. For example, the authors mention that they used vegetation types described by Gertenbach (1983) to guide the placement of their sampling plots, from which they then collected training and validation points. This suggests that they may have used point annotation, where individual pixels or locations are labeled with a particular class or category. Additionally, the authors mention that they created several small sampling plots within each vegetation type rather than using one large area, which could indicate that they used region-based annotation, where larger areas or regions are labeled with a particular class or category. It is also worth noting that the authors do not explicitly mention any object detection or semantic segmentation techniques, which would involve more complex annotations such as bounding boxes or pixel-level masks. Therefore, based on the available information, it seems likely that the authors primarily used point and region-based annotation techniques in their deep learning pipeline.
