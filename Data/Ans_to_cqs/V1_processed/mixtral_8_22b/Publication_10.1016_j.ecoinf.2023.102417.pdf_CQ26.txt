The text does not provide explicit information about techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the importance of creating specific datasets tailored to the desired application when applying deep learning models. This suggests that diverse data collection could be a technique used to mitigate data bias. Additionally, the text discusses the use of manual image annotation for model development, which might involve stratified splitting or oversampling/undersampling techniques to ensure balanced classes in the dataset. Nevertheless, these assumptions cannot be confirmed without further context.
