The data was split into two main categories: training and testing. The training group contained 80% of the total dataset, while the remaining 20% formed the test group. Within each category, the images were further divided based on the species they represented. This division followed an 80:20 ratio to ensure that the proportionate representation of each species was maintained in both the training and test groups. Before being fed into the models, the images were also rescaled to a uniform size. Additionally, an image augmentation strategy involving rotation, cropping, shearing, and flipping was employed to prevent overfitting and enhance the generalizability of the models. Furthermore, to tackle the issue of class imbalance in the dataset, the predictions were weighted accordingly.
