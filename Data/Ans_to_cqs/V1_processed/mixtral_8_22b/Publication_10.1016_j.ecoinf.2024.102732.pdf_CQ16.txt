The completion of training can be determined by various criteria depending on the specific algorithm being used. However, some common criteria include reaching a predefined number of epochs, achieving a desired level of accuracy or loss, or observing a plateau in the validation loss. In gradient boosting algorithms like XGBoost, early stopping rules can also be employed to halt training once the improvement in validation error falls below a certain threshold. Additionally, monitoring metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score during cross-validation can provide insights into the optimal point to stop training. Ultimately, the choice of criteria will depend on the goals and constraints of the particular application.
