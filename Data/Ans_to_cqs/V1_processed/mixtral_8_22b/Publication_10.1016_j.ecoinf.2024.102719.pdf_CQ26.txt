The context does not provide specific information about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions some common techniques used to improve the performance and generalizability of machine learning models, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling. These methods help mitigate issues related to imbalanced classes or uneven distribution of samples across different categories. Additionally, diverse data collection is essential to ensure that the trained models perform well on unseen datasets and do not exhibit biases towards certain features or characteristics. It is important to note that these techniques may also apply to deep learning pipelines, but further research or additional context might be required to discuss them specifically within this domain.
