To monitor the model performance during training, two strategies were employed: random grid search and Bayesian optimization. These strategies were used for hyperparameter optimization, which aimed to improve the performance of the machine learning models. The implementation of these strategies was done using GridSearchCV from Scikit-learn and the Hyperopt library (version 0.2.7). After selecting the best parameters for each model, the results were then compared to evaluate the effectiveness of the chosen strategies.
