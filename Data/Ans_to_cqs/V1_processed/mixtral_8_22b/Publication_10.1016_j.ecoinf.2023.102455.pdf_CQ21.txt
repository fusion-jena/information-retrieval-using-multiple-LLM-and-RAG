The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training for each machine learning algorithm mentioned. However, based on general practices and common procedures in machine learning, some possible postprocessing steps could include metrics calculation, confusion matrices, saliency maps, or other visualizations depending on the type of data and problem being addressed.

Metrics calculation is a crucial step in evaluating the performance of a trained model. Commonly used evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC, RMSE, MAPE, etc. These metrics help quantify how well the model has learned from the training data and its ability to generalize to unseen data.

Confusion matrices can be generated to summarize the performance of a classification model by comparing actual class labels with predicted ones. This provides insights into the types of errors made by the model, such as false positives and false negatives.

Saliency maps are often employed in computer vision tasks to highlight important regions within input images that contribute significantly towards the final prediction. They offer valuable interpretability and explainability aspects to deep learning models.

In summary, while the exact postprocessing steps may vary depending on the specific application and requirements, typical steps might involve calculating relevant evaluation metrics, generating confusion matrices, creating saliency maps, or employing other visualization techniques to better understand the behavior and performance of the trained model.
