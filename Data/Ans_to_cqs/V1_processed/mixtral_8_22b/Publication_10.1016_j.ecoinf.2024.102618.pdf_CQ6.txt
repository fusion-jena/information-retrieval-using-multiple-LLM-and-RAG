Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps may be involved depending on the specific requirements of the task and the nature of the input data. These steps aim to prepare the data in a suitable format for efficient processing and accurate prediction. Some common preprocessing techniques include:

1. Normalization: This involves rescaling the input features so they fall within a specified range or distribution. For example, min-max normalization scales each feature to lie between 0 and 1, while z-score normalization transforms the data to have zero mean and unit variance. Normalization helps ensure that all features contribute equally to the learning process and prevents any single feature from dominating due to its scale.

2. Scaling: Similar to normalization, scaling adjusts the magnitude of input features but typically focuses on preserving relative differences rather than absolute values. Common scaling methods include logarithmic scaling, power transformation, and standardization. Scaling can help improve convergence during optimization and reduce sensitivity to initial parameter settings.

3. Cleaning: Data cleaning involves identifying and handling missing, invalid, or inconsistent entries in the dataset. Techniques such as imputation (filling gaps with estimated values), outlier detection, and noise reduction can help maintain data integrity and prevent biased or erroneous outcomes.

4. Augmentation: Data augmentation generates additional samples by applying various transformations to existing instances, such as rotation, flipping, cropping, or adding noise. Augmentation can enhance model robustness and generalization by exposing it to diverse variations of the same underlying patterns.

5. Encoding: Categorical variables need to be converted into numerical representations before being fed into most machine learning algorithms. One-hot encoding and label encoding are popular approaches for mapping discrete categories onto continuous vectors.

In the given context, the authors mention balancing the dataset using the class-weighted technique and proposing a novel image pre-processing technique. However, they do not provide explicit details about these procedures or discuss other potential preprocessing steps. Therefore, based solely on the information available, one cannot definitively determine what specific preprocessing steps are involved before training the deep learning models in this study.
