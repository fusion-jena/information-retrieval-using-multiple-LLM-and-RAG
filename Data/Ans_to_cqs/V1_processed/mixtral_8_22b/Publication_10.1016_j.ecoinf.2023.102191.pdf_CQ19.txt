The text does not provide information on which specific frameworks were used to build the deep learning model. The authors mention the use of software but do not specify the type or name of any particular deep learning framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which frameworks were used based solely on this excerpt.
