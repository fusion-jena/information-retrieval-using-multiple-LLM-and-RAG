Data bias can significantly impact the performance of deep learning models. To address this issue during preprocessing, several techniques can be employed. One common method is stratified sampling, which ensures that the training and test datasets maintain the same class proportions as the original dataset. This helps prevent overfitting and underfitting due to imbalanced classes. Another technique is oversampling, where minority classes are duplicated to balance the dataset. Conversely, undersampling involves removing instances from majority classes to achieve balanced representation. Additionally, collecting diverse data can help reduce bias by ensuring that the model generalizes well across various scenarios. These methods aim to improve the robustness and fairness of deep learning models by minimizing the effects of data bias.
