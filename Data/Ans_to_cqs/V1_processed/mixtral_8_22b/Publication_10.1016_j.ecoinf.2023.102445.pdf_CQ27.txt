Unfortunately, there isn't enough context provided to determine the exact process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, typically, after training a deep learning model like YOLOv8, it would be saved or serialized so that it can be loaded later without having to retrain the model from scratch. Once the model has been saved, it could then be deployed onto a platform such as TensorFlow Serving, AWS SageMaker, Google Cloud ML Engine, etc., depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the project.
