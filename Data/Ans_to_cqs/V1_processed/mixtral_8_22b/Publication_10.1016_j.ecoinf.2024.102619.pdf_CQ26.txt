The text does not explicitly mention any specific technique to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does suggest some strategies that might help mitigate issues related to data bias. One approach mentioned is stratified splitting, where the images in each dataset were split into 80% training (including 5-fold cross-validation) and 20% testing subsets, with splits being stratified to preserve the class-ratio. This ensures that the distribution of classes remains consistent across different subsets of the data. Another strategy discussed is handling class imbalance, either by down-weighting common classes or up-sampling rare classes. These methods aim to balance the representation of different classes in the dataset, thus addressing potential biases caused by uneven class distributions. Additionally, increasing the availability and quality of ground truth data was suggested as a way to create feature representations better suited for automatic classification tasks. While these suggestions do not directly tackle data bias, they contribute to improving the overall quality and fairness of the dataset, indirectly addressing potential sources of bias.
