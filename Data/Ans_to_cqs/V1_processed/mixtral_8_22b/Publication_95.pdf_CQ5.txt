From the given context, there isn't explicit mention of specific datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does indicate that the networks were trained on a dataset referred to as the 'training set'. This training set was likely derived from the 'full data set', which consisted of images captured in close proximity and possibly with overlapping fields of view.

Additionally, it mentions that the networks ResNet50-v2 and MobileNet-v2 were explored for image classification, and these networks included weights pre-trained on ImageNet. This suggests that although the primary dataset used for training might not be explicitly mentioned, the models did leverage transfer learning from ImageNet.

In summary, while the exact names of the datasets used aren't specified, we do know that a 'full data set' was used to create a 'training set', and the models utilized transfer learning from ImageNet.
