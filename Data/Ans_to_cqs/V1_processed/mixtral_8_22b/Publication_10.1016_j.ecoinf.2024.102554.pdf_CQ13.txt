Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available in the given context to determine the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning models mentioned. The text discusses the use of machine learning methods in conjunction with satellite data interpretation but does not provide details about the specific hyperparameters employed in those models. To find out more about the hyperparameters used in these models, it would be necessary to refer to the original sources cited in the text, such as Cao et al. (2020), Kim et al. (2017), Wu et al. (2008), Binh et al. (2022), Sowmya et al. (2017), Vos et al. (2019), and Yang et al. (2013).
