The given context does not provide information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that VGG16 (OxfordNet) was used as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture due to its performance on the ImageNet dataset. However, it does not specify any details regarding the availability or location of the data repository for this deep learning pipeline. Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
