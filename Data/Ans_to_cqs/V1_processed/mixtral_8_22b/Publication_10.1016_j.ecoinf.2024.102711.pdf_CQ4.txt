The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, or scaling. However, it does discuss how AutoML libraries like AutoGluon can help improve the prediction accuracy of machine learning models by increasing both the quantity and quality of the original real-world datasets. Data augmentation is a common technique used to increase the amount of available data by applying various transformations to existing data points. While the context does not provide details about the exact data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it suggests that AutoGluon may employ similar strategies to enhance the performance of its models.
