After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the project. Some common postprocessing steps include:

1. Model evaluation metrics: Calculating various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., to evaluate the trained model's effectiveness. These metrics help assess how well the model has learned from the input data and its ability to generalize to unseen data.

2. Confusion Matrix: Creating a confusion matrix is another way to visualize the performance of the classification model. It provides detailed information about actual vs predicted values, including true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. The confusion matrix helps identify any potential biases or misclassifications in the model predictions.

3. Class probabilities: Extracting class probabilities from the trained model allows users to understand the confidence level associated with each prediction. High probability values indicate strong evidence supporting the assigned label, while low probability values may suggest uncertainty or ambiguity in the decision-making process.

4. Saliency Maps: Generating saliency maps involves highlighting important features contributing significantly towards making accurate predictions by the model. By identifying these critical regions, researchers can gain insights into which spectral bands, vegetation indices, soil indices, water indices, or clusters play essential roles in determining land use/land cover (LULC) categories.

In summary, postprocessing steps after model training involve evaluating the model's performance using various metrics, creating a confusion matrix for better understanding of errors, extracting class probabilities for confidence assessment, and generating saliency maps to identify crucial features influencing predictions.
