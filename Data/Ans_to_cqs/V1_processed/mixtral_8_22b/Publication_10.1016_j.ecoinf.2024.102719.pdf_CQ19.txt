Based on the given information, it does not explicitly mention which specific frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch are used to build the deep learning models. However, it mentions several packages like CatBoost, LightGBM, XGBoost, and Hyperopt that are used for implementing certain algorithms related to the machine learning models. These packages might use underlying frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, but without further details, we cannot definitively state which ones are being employed.
