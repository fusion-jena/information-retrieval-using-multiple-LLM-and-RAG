The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is out-of-bag validation. This method evaluates the accuracy of the model at simulated locations using an out-of-bag validation. Out-of-bag predictions for each simulated data point are obtained during the bagging process by predicting the values at the data points that were not selected for each bootstrap sample. The results of these predicted values are then averaged across all bootstrap samples. Additionally, the change in true performance at predicting each response variable after applying bagging weights based on KDE and spatial covariance approaches is monitored for all simulation runs.
