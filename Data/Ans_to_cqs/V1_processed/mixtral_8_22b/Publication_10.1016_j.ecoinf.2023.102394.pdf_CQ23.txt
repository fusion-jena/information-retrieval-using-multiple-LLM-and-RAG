The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it mentions that the study uses a set of 2207 SOCS (soil organic carbon stocks) data points collected from 2010 to 2014. Using a larger dataset can help improve the model's ability to generalize better to unseen data. Additionally, the study models the relationship between SOCS and various environmental factors like topography, parent material, soil variables, climate, and biotic variables. Including multiple relevant factors in the model could also contribute to improving its generalizability.
