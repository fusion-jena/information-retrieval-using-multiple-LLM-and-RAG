The provided context does not explicitly state the specific data format(s) used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the references mentioned that the primary focus is on images, specifically weed species images. This is evident from the mention of the 'DeepWeeds' dataset, which is described as a multiclass weed species image dataset. Additionally, several other studies referenced also deal with weed detection using imagery, such as Rahman et al.'s work on deep neural networks for weed detection. Therefore, while not directly stated, it can be reasonably assumed that the main data format used in this deep learning pipeline is image data.
