Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the type of optimizer employed. However, it does mention that the deep learning algorithm allows for choosing the number of network layers according to designer demands and training them using large-scale data. This implies that the architecture of the deep learning model, including the number of layers and possibly other structural elements, could be considered as part of its hyperparameters. Additionally, while not explicitly stated, it is common practice in deep learning to use various optimization algorithms, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, or RMSprop, along with their respective learning rates and other configurable settings. These aspects would also fall under the category of hyperparameters.
