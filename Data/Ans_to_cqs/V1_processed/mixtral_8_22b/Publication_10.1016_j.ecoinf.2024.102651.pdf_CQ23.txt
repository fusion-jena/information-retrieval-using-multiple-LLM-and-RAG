To improve the generalizability of their deep learning model, the authors introduced several measures. Firstly, they utilized a diverse dataset consisting of both small and medium objects. This allowed the model to learn from various data points, enhancing its adaptability to different scenarios. Secondly, they incorporated the Class Activation Mapping (CAM) technique within the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) module of their hybrid network. By doing so, the network could focus more on critical features, thereby improving its generalization ability. Lastly, they evaluated the impact of image size on classification performance by using the same classification network for both small and medium objects. The results showed that medium objects achieved higher classification accuracy compared to small objects under identical network conditions. These strategies collectively contributed to enhancing the robustness and applicability of the deep learning model across diverse datasets.
