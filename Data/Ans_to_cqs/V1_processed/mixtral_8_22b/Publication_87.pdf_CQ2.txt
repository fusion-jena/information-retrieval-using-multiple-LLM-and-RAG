The deep learning pipeline discussed in the given context primarily uses image data format. The authors mention using a dataset of labeled images for model training and validation, and then applying the trained model to predict on a new dataset of unlabeled images. They also discuss using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), specifically ResNet architectures (resnet18 and resnet50), which are commonly used for image classification tasks. Therefore, based on the information provided, the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is images.
