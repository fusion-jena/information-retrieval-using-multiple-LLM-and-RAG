Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline uses images as its primary data format. Specifically, the system works with a training database composed of 13,000 fish thumbnails extracted from video frames. These thumbnails vary in size from 20 x 40 pixels to 150 x 200 pixels, and each thumbnail contains only one labeled fish. Additionally, the system includes a class for the background, which consists of random thumbnails of the background and specific background thumbnails taken around the fish thumbnails. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning pipeline primarily utilizes image data in the form of thumbnails extracted from video frames.
