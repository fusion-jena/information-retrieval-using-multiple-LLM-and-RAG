The paper does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions using a list of cropped thumbnails and their labels, which were sent to the network. Additionally, the paper references the 2012 ImageNet competition, suggesting that the authors might have used or been inspired by the ImageNet dataset. Nevertheless, without explicit information about the datasets used, it cannot be definitively stated what datasets were utilized in the deep learning pipeline.
