The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the authors used a few-shot learning approach for training their Siamese network due to having an insufficient number of samples in their dataset. This approach involves defining the classification task as an N-way K-shot problem, where the training set contains N different categories, each comprising K labeled samples. In this case, two categories were defined during the training of the tracking tasks: target and non-target. Experiments were then performed using two-way one-shot learning. While these methods do not directly address generalizability concerns such as diverse datasets or cross-validation techniques, they may help improve the model's ability to learn from limited data and potentially enhance its performance across various scenarios.
