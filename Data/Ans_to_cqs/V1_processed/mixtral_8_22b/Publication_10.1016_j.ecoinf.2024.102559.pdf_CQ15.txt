The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it discusses various aspects of machine learning and remote sensing applications. The paper by Blondel et al. focuses on scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library in Python, but does not delve into optimization techniques for deep learning specifically. Similarly, Petty et al.'s work is about inferring habitat suitability and spread patterns of an exotic invasive pasture grass, while Prasai et al.'s research applies Google Earth Engine Python API and NAIP imagery for land use and land cover classification. None of these papers directly address the optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot determine which optimization techniques were applied in the deep learning pipeline.
