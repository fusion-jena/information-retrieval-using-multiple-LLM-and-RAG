The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on common practices in computer vision tasks, possible data annotation techniques could include bounding box annotation for object detection or localization tasks, semantic segmentation for pixel-level classification, and instance segmentation for identifying individual objects within an image. Additionally, the text mentions using a five-fold subject-exclusive method, which might suggest that the dataset includes labeled subjects or classes. But without more specific details, it is impossible to definitively state what data annotation techniques were employed in this case.
