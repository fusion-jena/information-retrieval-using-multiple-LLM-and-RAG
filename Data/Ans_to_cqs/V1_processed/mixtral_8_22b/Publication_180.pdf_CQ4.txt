The text does not provide specific information on the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that TensorFlow, an open-source software platform supporting deep learning research and applications, was used in the project. Common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, and zooming. These techniques help improve model performance and prevent overfitting by increasing the amount of training data available. It can be assumed that similar techniques were likely employed in this study, but without explicit mention, it cannot be confirmed which specific techniques were used.
