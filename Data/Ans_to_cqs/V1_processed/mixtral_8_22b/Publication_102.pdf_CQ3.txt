The context does not provide explicit details about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the models use object detection or semantic segmentation techniques due to their application in counting objects in images. Object detection typically involves bounding box annotations around the objects of interest, while semantic segmentation requires pixel-level labeling of different classes within an image. Given that the models aim to count objects in images, it is likely that they employ either bounding box annotations or semantic segmentation techniques during the data annotation process.
