The purpose of the deep learning model used in this study is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, considering that the authors use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is commonly employed for image recognition tasks such as object detection, classification, and segmentation, we can infer that the model might be used for one of these purposes. Furthermore, since the authors mention using a pre-trained ResNet50 model, originally intended for ImageNet classification, it suggests that their primary goal could be related to classification tasks. Additionally, the authors discuss the application of CNNs in recognizing various bird species, further supporting the idea that they may be utilizing the deep learning model for classification purposes.
