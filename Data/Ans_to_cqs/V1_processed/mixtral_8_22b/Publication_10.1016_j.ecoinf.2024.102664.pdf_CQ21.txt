After the model training phase, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the project or study. Some common postprocessing steps include:

1. Model evaluation metrics: Calculating various performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, etc., to evaluate the trained model's performance. These metrics help assess how well the model has learned from the given dataset and its ability to generalize to unseen data.

2. Confusion matrix: Creating a confusion matrix to visualize the performance of the classifier. It provides detailed information about true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives, which helps understand the strengths and weaknesses of the model.

3. Saliency maps: Generating saliency maps to highlight important features contributing to the final prediction made by the model. Saliency maps provide insights into what the model focuses on while making predictions, helping improve interpretability and trustworthiness.

4. Hyperparameter tuning: Adjusting hyperparameters based on the initial model performance to further enhance its predictive capabilities. Techniques like grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, etc., can be employed for this purpose.

5. Ensemble methods: Combining multiple models to create an ensemble, aiming to achieve better overall performance compared to individual models. Commonly used ensemble techniques include bagging, boosting, stacking, etc.

In the case of algal bloom forecasting using hybrid deep learning models, these postprocessing steps would involve evaluating the model's performance using appropriate metrics, analyzing feature importance through saliency maps, fine-tuning hyperparameters if necessary, and potentially employing ensemble methods to improve overall performance.
