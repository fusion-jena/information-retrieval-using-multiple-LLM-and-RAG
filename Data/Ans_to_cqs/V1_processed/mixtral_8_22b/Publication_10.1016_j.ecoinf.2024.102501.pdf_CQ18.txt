Based on the given information, it appears that the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using a portion of the dataset as a validation set. Specifically, the data from the first eight days were used as the training set, while the data from the last two days were used as the validation set. This approach allows for the evaluation of the model's ability to generalize to new data and provides insight into its performance during training. Additionally, various metrics such as R2, MSE, and MAE were used to assess the model's performance on both the training and validation sets. However, there is no explicit mention of any specific techniques or methods employed to further improve the model's performance during training beyond what has already been described.
