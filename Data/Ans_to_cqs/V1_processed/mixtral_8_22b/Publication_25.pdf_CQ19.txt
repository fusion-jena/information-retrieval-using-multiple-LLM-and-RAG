The text does not explicitly mention which specific deep learning frameworks were used to build the deep learning model. However, it mentions that RetinaNet was used as the object detection framework, which combines object detection and classification into a single network. RetinaNet is compatible with popular deep learning libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch, but without explicit information, we cannot definitively state which one was used in this case.
