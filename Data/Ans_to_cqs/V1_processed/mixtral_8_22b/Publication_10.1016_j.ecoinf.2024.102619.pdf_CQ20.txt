The study uses an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) with 8GB VRAM and an Intel Core i7â€“9700 CPU for training the deep learning model. The authors mention that using a GPU for training the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) significantly increased the training time compared to using a Central Processing Unit (CPU), making it about 40-50 times slower than the combination of CNN and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
