Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. However, it does state that the Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM) algorithm was employed, which is a type of artificial neural network that uses unsupervised learning to produce a low-dimensional representation of the input space, preserving its topology. Additionally, the study mentions using the R package 'kohonen', which implements various self-organizing maps algorithms, including SOFM. Therefore, one could infer that the hyperparameters related to the SOFM algorithm would be relevant, but without further details, their exact values remain unknown.
