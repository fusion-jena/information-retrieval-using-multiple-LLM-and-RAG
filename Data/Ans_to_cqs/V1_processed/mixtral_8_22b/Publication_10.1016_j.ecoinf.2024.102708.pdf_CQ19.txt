The text does not provide information about the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models. However, since the paper mentions YOLOv5, it is likely that one of the popular deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch was used, as these libraries are commonly used for building deep learning models like YOLOv5.
