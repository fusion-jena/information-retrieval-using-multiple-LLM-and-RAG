The deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context uses two main datasets: Sentinel-2 optical images and Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) LIDAR data. The Sentinel-2 mission provides high-resolution optical imagery from the European Space Agency (ESA)'s Copernicus program, while GEDI is a spaceborne laser altimeter instrument aboard the International Space Station (ISS) designed to measure forest canopy heights and vertical structures. These datasets were combined using a deep learning approach involving convolutional neural networks to create a high-resolution canopy height model (CHM) called Lang10m. This model was then evaluated across various forest plots in Italy and Germany to estimate horizontal heterogeneity (HH) and analyze its correlation with tree species diversity.
