There are several techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the original class proportions. This ensures that both sets contain representative samples from each class, reducing the likelihood of biased results due to imbalanced classes.

Oversampling is a method used when dealing with imbalanced datasets where one class has significantly fewer instances than another. It involves duplicating examples from the minority class until its size matches that of the majority class. Alternatively, synthetic examples can be created through interpolation or extrapolation techniques.

Undersampling is another approach to handling imbalanced datasets but focuses on reducing the number of examples in the majority class instead of increasing those in the minority class. This can be done randomly or based on specific criteria like removing redundant or noisy examples.

Diverse data collection aims to gather a wide range of examples representing different aspects of the problem domain. This helps ensure that the trained model generalizes well across various scenarios rather than being overfit to a particular subset of the data.

These techniques should be applied judiciously depending on the characteristics of the dataset and the nature of the task at hand. In some cases, combining multiple methods may yield better results than relying solely on one approach.

Based on the given context, there is no direct mention of these techniques being used specifically for addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, they are commonly employed in machine learning applications, including those related to ecology and natural resource management.
