Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about any preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning applied to the audio data before being fed into the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that the audio data is converted into a novel spectrogram representation before being inputted into the network. This conversion process could potentially involve some form of preprocessing, although the exact details aren't specified in the provided text. It should also be noted that preprocessing steps often depend on the nature of the dataset and the requirements of the chosen machine learning algorithm. Therefore, without additional context, it cannot be definitively stated what preprocessing steps were taken prior to training the deep learning model.
