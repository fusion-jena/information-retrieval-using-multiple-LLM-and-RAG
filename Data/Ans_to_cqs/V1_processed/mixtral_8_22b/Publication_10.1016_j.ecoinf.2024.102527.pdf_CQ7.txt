The data was split based on the conceptual model mentioned in the study. When using the ImageNet dataset, the pre-trained model on ImageNet-1k was directly used as the source model, eliminating the need for dataset splitting. However, when dealing with both the SS and LSM datasets, which are camera trap image datasets, special considerations were made due to their unique characteristics. Since multiple images are captured in succession during a single trigger event, these images are often highly similar to each other. To maintain the integrity of events during data splitting and avoid poor generalization of the DCNN model, all images belonging to the same event were placed in the same dataset.

For the SS dataset serving as the target domain datasets, the validation and test sets remained unchanged, referred to as S\_V and S\_T, respectively. As for the training sets, they were created by randomly selecting capture events from S\_2\_100 and generating five different training sets containing 2000, 5000, 8000, 10,000, and 20,000 samples, respectively. These training sets were named S\_2, S\_5, S\_8, S\_10, and S\_20 accordingly. Detailed information about the data splitting can be found in Table S.3 of the Supporting Information.
