The context does not provide specific information about the criteria used to split the dataset into training, testing, and validation sets for deep learning model training. However, common practices include splitting the dataset randomly, stratified sampling, or time series split depending on the nature of the data. It is also important to ensure that the distribution of samples across different classes remains consistent between the splits.

Based on the given context, it can only be assumed that the authors followed standard practices for splitting their dataset. Without further information, it cannot be determined if any specific criteria were used for splitting the data.
