The purpose of the deep learning model in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred from the text that the deep learning model is likely being used for classification tasks related to species distribution modeling. Specifically, the model appears to be part of a semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework, which aims to leverage both labeled and unlabeled data to improve performance and robustness in the target task. In this case, the target task involves determining the presence or absence of a particular species at various sites based on environmental information. The labeled data points consist of pairs of input variables describing environmental information and output variables indicating the presence or absence of the target species. Unlabeled data points also contain input variables but lack corresponding output variables. By employing a deep learning model within this SSL framework, researchers hope to enhance their ability to accurately predict species distributions across diverse habitats while minimizing potential issues such as bias and overfitting.
