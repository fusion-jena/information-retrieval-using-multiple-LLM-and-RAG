The text does not provide information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. Therefore, we cannot determine if they used methods like grid search or random search.

Based on the given context, there is no mention of any specific optimization techniques used for selecting the optimal hyperparameters for the model. It only discusses the process of fine-tuning the weights of a pre-trained VGGnet using the Benthoz15 dataset and extracting activation vectors from the first fully connected layer as feature representations. Additionally, it mentions the selection of patch sizes for achieving the best classification accuracy but does not specify the methodology behind choosing those particular patch sizes.
