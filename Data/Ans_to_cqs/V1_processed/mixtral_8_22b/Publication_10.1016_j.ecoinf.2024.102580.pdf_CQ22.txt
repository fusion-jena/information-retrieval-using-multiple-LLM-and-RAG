To evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, several metrics were employed. These include accuracy, precision, and recall. Specifically, the semantic segmentation model used to identify substrate types achieved an accuracy of 92%. Precision was also calculated for each class; the precision for the vegetation class was 0.90, for the bare class was 0.96, and for the 'other' class was 0.50. Recall, or the proportion of true positive predictions out of the actual positives, was also measured. The recall of the model reached 0.97 for vegetation, 0.87 for bare substrate, and the 'other' class reached a recall of 0.53.
