In this study, the researchers used bounding box annotation as their primary data annotation technique. They transformed video clips into still images at a rate of one frame per second and then manually annotated sharks and other marine species present in the frames with bounding boxes. This process resulted in 26,947 fish annotations across various species. Since the Faster RCNN architecture automatically generates negative samples, it wasn't necessary to annotate them separately. Other possible data annotation techniques such as instance segmentation or semantic segmentation were not mentioned in this particular study.
