Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information on the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which datasets were utilized in the study.

Based on the available information, we can only infer that the study involves developing deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), and a hybrid CNN-LSTM model for algal bloom forecasts in the Zhoushan fishery. However, details regarding the datasets used for training these models are not mentioned.
