The paper does not provide explicit details about how the hyperparameters were optimized. However, it mentions that well-known values of hyperparameters were used to train the models. This suggests that the authors might have relied on established best practices or previous research findings rather than conducting their own optimization process like grid search or random search. It also states that tuning hyperparameters is likely to improve results, implying that there may still be room for further optimization.
