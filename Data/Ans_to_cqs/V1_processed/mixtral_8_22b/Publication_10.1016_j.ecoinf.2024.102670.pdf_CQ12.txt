The text does not provide explicit information about the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it mentions that Xu et al. (2021) developed a Convolutional Neural Network-based segmentation model. Therefore, based on this reference, one could infer that the pipeline uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as part of its deep learning approach.
