The given context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer from the information provided that the data format used is most likely images. The text mentions the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which are primarily used for processing grid-like topology data, such as images. Additionally, the context discusses EfficientNetB0, which is designed for working with small image inputs. Furthermore, the discussion about collecting sufficient datasets with enough data points for efficient classification of rare species suggests that the data format being referred to is indeed images. Therefore, based on this analysis, we can conclude that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is most likely images.
