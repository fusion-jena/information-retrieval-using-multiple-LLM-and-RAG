According to the provided context, the hyperparameters of the model were optimized through exploration to find the optimal network architecture for classifying moth species. However, the specific method used for optimization, such as grid search or random search, is not explicitly mentioned. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the exact method used for hyperparameter optimization.
