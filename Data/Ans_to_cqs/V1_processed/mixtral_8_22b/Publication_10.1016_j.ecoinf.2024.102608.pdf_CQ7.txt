The text does not provide explicit information on how the data was split for deep learning model training. However, based on common practices in machine learning, we can infer that the data might have been divided into two sets: a training set and a test set. The training set would be used to fit the model, while the test set would be used to evaluate its performance. Additionally, there could also be a third set called the validation set, which is often used during the process of tuning hyperparameters. In this case, the authors mention using a randomized grid search method to select the best hyperparameters, but they do not specify whether a separate validation set was used for this purpose. Therefore, without further details, we cannot definitively state the exact criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in this particular study.
