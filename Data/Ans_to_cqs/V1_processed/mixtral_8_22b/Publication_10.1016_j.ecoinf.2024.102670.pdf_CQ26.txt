The given context does not provide direct information about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline using techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, some relevant insights can still be derived from the text.

Deep learning models require large amounts of labeled data, often referred to as ground truth data, to train effectively. In cases where acquiring sufficient ground truth data is challenging, alternative approaches like crowdsourcing have been employed. For instance, Sharma et al. (2017) utilized crowd-sourcing to obtain manual annotations for chromosome images, demonstrating the effectiveness of this method.

To improve performance in various domains, researchers have explored machine learning techniques, specifically deep learning models. Guo et al. (2021) applied a deep learning-based model to classify points of interest in 3D volumetric images, while Xu et al. (2021) developed a convolutional neural network-based segmentation model and compared its performance to other methods. These studies highlight the use of deep learning models to enhance image analysis tasks.

Although the context does not explicitly mention techniques for handling data bias, it emphasizes the importance of having adequate and representative training data for deep learning models. To mitigate data bias, one could employ strategies such as stratified sampling, which ensures that different classes or subgroups within the dataset are proportionately represented during training. Oversampling and undersampling techniques can also help balance datasets containing unequal distributions of classes. Lastly, collecting diverse data from multiple sources can further reduce bias and improve the generalizability of deep learning models.
