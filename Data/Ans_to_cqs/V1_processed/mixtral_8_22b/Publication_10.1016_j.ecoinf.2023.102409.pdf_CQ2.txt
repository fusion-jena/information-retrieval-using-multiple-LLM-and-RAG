The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer from the context that the models mentioned, such as Unet and Deeplabv3+, are primarily used for image processing tasks like semantic segmentation. Therefore, it can be assumed that the data format used in these pipelines would most likely be image files, possibly in formats like.jpg or.png. Nevertheless, without more detailed information, this cannot be confirmed definitively.
