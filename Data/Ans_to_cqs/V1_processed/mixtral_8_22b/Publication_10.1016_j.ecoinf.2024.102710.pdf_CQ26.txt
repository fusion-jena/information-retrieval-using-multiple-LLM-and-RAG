Based on the provided context, it does not explicitly mention any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some general approaches to addressing data bias can be discussed. These include stratified splitting, which ensures that the distribution of classes or features in the dataset remains consistent across train/test splits; oversampling, where minority classes are duplicated to balance the dataset; undersampling, where majority classes are reduced to achieve balance; and diverse data collection, which aims to gather a wide variety of examples representative of real-world scenarios. It should be noted that these techniques were not mentioned in the provided context, so they might not necessarily apply to the research being conducted.
