According to the given information, it is not explicitly mentioned how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, whether by using methods like grid search or random search. However, it does state that "meticulous manual tuning of hyperparameters was conducted" to achieve optimal model performance. Therefore, it can be inferred that the optimization process might have been carried out manually rather than employing automated techniques like grid search or random search.
