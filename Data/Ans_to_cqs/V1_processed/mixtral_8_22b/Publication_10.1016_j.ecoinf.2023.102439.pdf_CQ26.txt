The given context does not provide specific information about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some commonly used techniques to handle data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and collecting diverse data.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets or strata based on specific criteria, ensuring each subset has a representative sample of the entire population. This technique helps maintain the original class distribution in both the training and testing sets.

Oversampling is a method where synthetic samples are created from existing minority classes to balance the dataset. It can be achieved using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). Undersampling, on the other hand, reduces the majority class size to match the minority class count. Random under-sampling and NearMiss are popular undersampling methods.

Collecting diverse data involves gathering more data points representing different aspects of the problem domain. This approach aims to reduce bias caused by limited representation in the dataset.

While the given context doesn't explicitly mention these techniques, they are generally applicable to handling data bias in deep learning pipelines.
