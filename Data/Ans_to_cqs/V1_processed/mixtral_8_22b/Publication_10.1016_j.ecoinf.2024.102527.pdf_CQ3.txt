The text does not provide explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that each image in the ImageNet dataset is manually annotated. Manual annotation could involve various techniques such as bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, or instance segmentation, among others. Unfortunately, without more detailed information, it cannot be determined precisely which technique(s) were applied in this case.
