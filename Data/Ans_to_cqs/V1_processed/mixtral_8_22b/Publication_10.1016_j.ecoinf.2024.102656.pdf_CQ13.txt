Unfortunately, there is no information available regarding the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model mentioned in the given context. The context only provides details about the performance of different component models such as GLM, MaxEnt, RF, GBM, and MARS, but it does not mention any specific hyperparameters like learning rate or optimizer used in these models. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information based on the given context.
