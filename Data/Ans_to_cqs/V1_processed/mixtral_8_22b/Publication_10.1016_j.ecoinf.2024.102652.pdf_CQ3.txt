Based on the given context, it appears that the study uses semantic segmentation as the data annotation technique in their deep learning pipeline. Semantic segmentation involves assigning a category label to each pixel of an image, which is different from other annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.

Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects within images, while instance segmentation involves identifying individual instances of objects within an image by outlining them individually. However, these techniques do not seem to be mentioned in the provided context. Instead, the focus is on applying semantic segmentation through the MU-NET deep learning method to create soil salinity maps. Therefore, we can conclude that the study primarily employs semantic segmentation as its data annotation technique.
