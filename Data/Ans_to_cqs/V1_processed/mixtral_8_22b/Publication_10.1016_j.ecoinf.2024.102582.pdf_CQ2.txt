The text does not provide explicit information about the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer that the study uses remote sensing data, specifically United States Geological Survey Landsat Surface reflectance products, which are likely in raster format due to their nature as satellite imagery. Additionally, the study mentions using Google Earth Pro to generate sample points, suggesting the use of vector data. Therefore, it can be concluded that both raster and vector data formats are employed in the study.
