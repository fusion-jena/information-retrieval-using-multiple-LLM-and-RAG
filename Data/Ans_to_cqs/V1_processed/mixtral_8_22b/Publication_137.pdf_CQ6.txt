The article discusses a framework for semantic segmentation of airborne LiDAR point clouds using deep learning methods. However, it does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning before training the deep learning model. Instead, it focuses on processing the data with a deep neural network and adjusting various parameters such as the training epoch, batch size, and volume size to output a classifier for prediction. It also mentions using the hold-out method to distinguish the test set and the training set at a ratio of 3:7 for preprocessing the original data. Additionally, the authors investigate the effects of several parameters in their framework, including the regularization strength, voxel size for the minimal partition, and training batch size. They further adjust the parameters of networks to explore the influence of parameters on experimental results and discuss the selection of the frame parameters.
