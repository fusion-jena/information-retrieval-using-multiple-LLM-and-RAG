The text does not provide explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that labeled training data is required for deep learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) used for image analysis. Labeled training data typically consists of input data along with its corresponding correct output or label. For example, in image classification tasks, this could involve providing images along with their respective labels indicating the objects present within them.

While the sources of these labeled training datasets are not explicitly mentioned in the given context, common methods for obtaining such data include manual annotation, crowdsourcing, and utilizing existing public datasets. Manual annotation involves human experts manually assigning labels to the dataset, while crowdsourcing leverages contributions from a large group of individuals to generate labels. Public datasets refer to collections of pre-labeled data made available for research purposes, often compiled by organizations or institutions.

In summary, although the exact methods for gathering raw data in the deep learning pipeline are not specified in the provided context, it can be assumed that labeled training data is essential for developing deep learning models like CNNs. Common ways to obtain this data include manual annotation, crowdsourcing, and employing publicly accessible datasets.
