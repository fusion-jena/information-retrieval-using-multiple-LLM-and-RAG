The text does not explicitly state the purpose of the deep learning model used in the study. However, it mentions that the integration of machine learning and deep learning methodologies aims to forecast behavioral patterns and map animals' actual movement trajectories. This suggests that the deep learning model could be used for prediction tasks related to animal behavior, possibly involving classification or regression to identify patterns or trends in the data. It may also involve some form of sequence analysis or time series prediction given the focus on mapping movement trajectories over time. Without more specific information about the model architecture or training process, it would be difficult to determine the exact purpose of the deep learning model.
