The text does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized using methods such as grid search or random search. However, it mentions that some model parameters were modified from the default configuration to balance resource usage and training speed. This suggests that there might have been some form of optimization involved, although the specific method remains unclear based solely on the given context.
