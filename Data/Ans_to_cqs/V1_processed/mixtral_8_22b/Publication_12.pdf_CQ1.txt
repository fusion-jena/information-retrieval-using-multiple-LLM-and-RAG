The text does not provide explicit details about the method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. It mentions that low-level features are some of the raw data points, such as pixels in images, but it doesn't specify how these images were obtained. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of BatNet, a neural network designed for analyzing bat echolocation calls, suggesting that audio recordings might be one source of raw data. However, without more context, it is impossible to determine the exact methods used for collecting raw data in this particular case.
