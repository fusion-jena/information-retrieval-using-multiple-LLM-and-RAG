After the model training, there are several postprocessing steps that can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the project. Some common postprocessing steps include saliency maps, metrics calculation, and creating a confusion matrix.

Saliency maps are used to highlight the important regions in the input image that contribute most to the final classification result. They provide insights into how the model makes its decisions and can help identify any biases or errors in the model.

Metrics calculation involves evaluating the performance of the model using various evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, accuracy, etc. These metrics help quantify the effectiveness of the model and allow for comparison with other models.

Creating a confusion matrix is another useful postprocessing step. A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the predictions made by the model compared to the actual labels. It helps visualize the performance of the model and identify any patterns or trends in the misclassifications.

In the case of the given paper, it appears that the authors did not explicitly mention any postprocessing steps after the model training. However, they do discuss the use of a confusion matrix to evaluate the performance of their model. Specifically, they define four essential parameters of the confusion matrix - True Positive (TP), True Negative (TN), False Positive (FP), and False Negative (FN). Additionally, they calculate sensitivity (TPR) using Equation (4) to measure the accuracy of the model. Therefore, based on the information available, we can infer that the authors likely used a confusion matrix as part of their postprocessing steps to evaluate the performance of their model.
