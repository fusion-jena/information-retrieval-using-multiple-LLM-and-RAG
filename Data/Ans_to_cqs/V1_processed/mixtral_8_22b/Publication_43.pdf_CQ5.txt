In this study, the authors use their own custom dataset consisting of 80x80 pixel image patches of Ziziphus lotus shrubs and bare soil with sparse vegetation. They collected 100 images for each class, which were divided into 80 images for training and 20 images for validation. This dataset was used to train and validate the CNN models, specifically ResNet and GoogLeNet.
