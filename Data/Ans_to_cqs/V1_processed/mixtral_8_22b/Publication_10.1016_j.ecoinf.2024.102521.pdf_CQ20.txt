The provided context does not explicitly mention which specific hardware resources are used for training the deep learning models. However, it can be inferred from the context that the process involves training and storing models using an interface provided by the site and its computational resources. This suggests that the training likely uses some form of hardware acceleration, such as GPUs or TPUs, given the common use of these resources in deep learning applications. Nevertheless, without explicit information about the hardware resources used, it cannot be definitively stated which ones are utilized for training the deep learning models.
