I am sorry, but there is no information about data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline in the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query based on the available information.

Based on the provided context, it appears that the authors have built machine learning models using Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) algorithms. They optimized the structure and hyperparameters of these models using Optuna, a hyperparameter optimization framework. The performance of the algorithms was evaluated by comparing their loss functions, specifically Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Coefficient of Determination (R2). The results show that the GBDT models had the highest accuracy for predicting both the first flowering date and the full blossom date. However, there is no mention of any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
