The provided context does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some common techniques used in general include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets or strata based on certain criteria, then randomly selecting samples from each stratum to create the training and testing datasets. This ensures that both sets have roughly the same distribution of classes or features.

Oversampling increases the number of instances in the minority class by duplicating existing examples or creating synthetic ones using methods like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). Undersampling reduces the number of instances in the majority class by removing examples, either randomly or according to certain criteria.

Diverse data collection aims to gather a wide range of data points representing different scenarios, conditions, or populations to reduce potential biases caused by underrepresentation or overrepresentation of certain groups.

These techniques can help mitigate data bias and improve model performance, but they should be applied carefully considering their potential drawbacks and limitations.
