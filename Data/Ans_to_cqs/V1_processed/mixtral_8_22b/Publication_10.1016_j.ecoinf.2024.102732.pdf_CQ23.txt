Based on the given information, there are no specific details about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, some common practices used to improve the generalization of deep learning models include using diverse datasets, cross-validation, and stratified splitting. These techniques help prevent overfitting and allow the model to perform well on unseen data.

In this case, we can infer that the researchers may have employed similar strategies since they mention the use of various algorithms such as Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). They also discuss the optimization of hyperparameters, which suggests that they might have used techniques like cross-validation or grid search to find the best parameters for their models.

Additionally, the authors emphasize the importance of integrating different types of input features, such as spectral bands, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Digital Elevation Model (SRTM DEM), and vegetation-derived indices, to achieve better results. This approach could contribute to improving the robustness and generalizability of the models by providing them with richer and more diverse sources of information.

However, without explicit mentions of specific techniques like diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, we cannot definitively state what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
