The text does not provide information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that AN was implemented in MATLAB and the 'classical' machine-learning algorithms were run in Python using the scikit-learn toolbox. However, it does not specify any links or repositories for accessing this code. Therefore, I do not have the necessary information to determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
