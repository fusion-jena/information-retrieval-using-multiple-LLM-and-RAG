To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, a diverse dataset was utilized, consisting of images with varying resolutions, scales, and spectral characteristics. Secondly, cross-validation was employed during the training phase to evaluate the performance of the model across multiple subsets of the data. Lastly, stratified splitting was implemented to maintain the balance of classes within each subset, ensuring that the model could accurately learn from all categories present in the dataset. These techniques helped improve the robustness and reliability of the deep learning model, enabling it to perform well even when faced with new, unseen data.
