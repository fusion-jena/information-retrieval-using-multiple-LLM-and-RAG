The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model include parameters defining the architecture such as the number of layers, number and size of convolutions, and connections between layers. They also include parameters related to the training process like the learning rate, neuron activation, and back-propagation computation. However, specific values or details about these hyperparameters were not mentioned in the given context.
