Based on the given context, there is no explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, generally speaking, some common postprocessing steps include calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., creating confusion matrices to visualize the performance of the classifier, generating saliency maps or heatmaps to understand which parts of the input data were most important for the model's prediction, and performing error analysis to identify any systematic errors or biases in the model's predictions. These steps can help evaluate the model's performance and provide insights into how it makes its decisions.
