The text does not provide explicit details about how the data was split for deep learning model training into train, test, or validation sets. However, it mentions that cross-validation was performed, which typically involves splitting the dataset into multiple subsets, where each subset serves as the testing set once, while the remaining subsets form the training set. This process is repeated until all subsets have been used as the testing set. Additionally, the text states that the threshold was derived from the average output of five models, suggesting that some form of ensemble method might have been applied during the training phase.
