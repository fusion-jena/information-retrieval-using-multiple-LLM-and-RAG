The given context does not provide specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the context that the input data includes precipitation, temperature, and various land use factors such as agricultural land use factor (ALUF), forest land use factor (FLUF), grassland usage factor (GLUF), shrub land use factor (SLUF), and urban land use factor (ULUF). These factors suggest that the raw data might have been collected through remote sensing techniques, satellite imagery, or ground-based measurements. Additionally, the mention of catchment areas indicates that hydrological data may also be involved. Nevertheless, without explicit information regarding the data collection methods, this remains speculative.

Based on the context, we cannot definitively state what methods were used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. It would require additional information beyond what has been provided here.
