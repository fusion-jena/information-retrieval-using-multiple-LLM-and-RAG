The deep learning pipeline primarily uses time-frequency input windows, which are essentially spectrograms derived from audio files. Spectrograms are visual representations of the spectrum of frequencies varying over time. They are often represented as two-dimensional images where one axis represents time, another axis represents frequency, and the intensity of color indicates the amplitude of a particular frequency at a specific point in time. Therefore, the primary data format used in this pipeline is image data, specifically spectrograms generated from audio files.
