The text does not provide specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the smallest dataset comprised 3900 images, which combined a two-second window size and 90 dpi for the transfer learning approach. It also states that the most suitable architecture was chosen based on the best validation accuracy and precision obtained during training. Additionally, it notes that the model training and prediction procedures were executed on Microsoft Azure using instance NV12s v3 with 12 vCPUs and 112 GB RAM. The CNNs were implemented using TensorFlow and Python 3, and the Ubuntu 20.04 operating system was used. Unfortunately, without more specific details, we cannot determine the exact nature or source of these datasets.
