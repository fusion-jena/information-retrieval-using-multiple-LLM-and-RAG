Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, common metrics used in evaluating deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC). Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of total predictions made. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made. Recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positives. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both. Finally, AUC measures the ability of the model to distinguish between classes, where a higher value indicates better performance.
