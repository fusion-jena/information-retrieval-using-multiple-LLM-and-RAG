Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The context mentions various datasets such as GlobeLand30, ALOS World 3D-30 m, China soil map based harmonized world soil database (HWSD), MODIS image MOD13Q1, CRU dataset, and others. However, it does not provide any specific details about the availability of the deep learning pipeline data repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to your query.
