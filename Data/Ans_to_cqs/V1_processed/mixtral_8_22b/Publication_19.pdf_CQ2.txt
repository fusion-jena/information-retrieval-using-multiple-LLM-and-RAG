The data format used in the deep learning pipeline for this research is images. The study aims to classify images retrieved from camera traps using deep learning techniques. Specifically, the dataset consists of 33,984 images taken during day and night with six different animal classes. These images serve as input for training various neural network architectures such as Inception-V3, MobileNet-V2, ResNet-18, and DenseNet-121. Therefore, the primary data format utilized in this deep learning pipeline is image data.
