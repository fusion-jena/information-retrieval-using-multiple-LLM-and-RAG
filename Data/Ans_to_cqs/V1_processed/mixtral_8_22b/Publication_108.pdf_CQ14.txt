Based on the given information, it appears that the hyperparameters of the model were optimized through a fine-tuning process. The researchers tested different hyperparameter settings, including the number of blocks, number of filters, and learning rate, to find an optimal setting for their problem. They evaluated the performance of these settings using evaluation metrics such as mean Intersection over Union (IoU) and accuracy. After testing various scenarios, they selected Scenario 5 as the optimal solution due to its high IoU and accuracy while requiring fewer training epochs. Therefore, it can be inferred that the optimization method used was a form of manual tuning or trial-and-error approach rather than automated methods like grid search or random search.
