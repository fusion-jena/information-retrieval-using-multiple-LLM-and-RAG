The text does not provide explicit information about specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning models. However, it mentions that the models were built using a general pipeline (Fig. 3), which likely includes some form of preprocessing. Common preprocessing techniques for image datasets include normalization, resizing, augmentation, and noise reduction. For audio datasets like the one mentioned here, common preprocessing methods may involve converting raw audio files into spectrograms or Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), normalization, and splitting the data into smaller windows. Based on the given context, we cannot determine the exact preprocessing steps applied to the dataset; however, these are potential methods that could have been employed.
