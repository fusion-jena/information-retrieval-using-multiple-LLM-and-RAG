Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, or validation sets. However, common practices in machine learning include splitting datasets randomly, stratified sampling based on target variable distribution, or temporal/spatial partitioning depending on the nature of the problem. In this case, since the research involves time series data and spatial analysis, it might be beneficial to consider temporal or spatial splits when dividing the data. Nonetheless, without more details about the specific deep learning models being employed, it remains uncertain which method would be most suitable.
