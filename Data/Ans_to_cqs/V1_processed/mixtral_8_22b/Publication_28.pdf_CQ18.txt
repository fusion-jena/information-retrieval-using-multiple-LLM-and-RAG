Based on the given information, it appears that there isn't any direct mention of a specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, we do see that the PTDLEN-VAE model was evaluated against other techniques like DLEN-VAE, DLEN-DNN, and DLEN-LSTM on the UCM dataset. This evaluation was done using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. From this, we can infer that these metrics were likely used to track the progress and performance of the model during its development and training stages. Additionally, the use of the IKHO algorithm for parameter optimization suggests that some form of monitoring or tracking might have been employed to ensure the best possible configuration for the model. Nonetheless, without explicit details about the actual strategies used to monitor the model performance during training, one cannot provide a definitive answer.
