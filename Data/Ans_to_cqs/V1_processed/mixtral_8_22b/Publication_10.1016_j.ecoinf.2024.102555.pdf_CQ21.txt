The given context does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training for this particular study. However, some common postprocessing steps used in machine learning or deep learning models include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, creating confusion matrices, and performing cross-validation. These techniques help evaluate the performance of a trained model and identify areas where it may need improvement.

Saliency maps can be generated using various techniques like GradCAM, LIME, or SHAP to visualize which parts of the input data were most important for the model's predictions. This helps researchers understand how their model makes decisions and can lead to insights about potential biases or errors in the dataset.

Calculating evaluation metrics allows researchers to quantify the performance of their model objectively. Commonly used metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions made by the model. Precision indicates the ratio of true positive predictions to total predicted positives, while recall shows the ratio of true positive predictions to actual positives in the dataset. The F1 score combines both precision and recall into a single metric.

Confusion matrices provide a more detailed view of a model's performance by showing the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives produced by the model. They allow researchers to see if their model has any systematic biases towards certain classes or misclassifications between similar classes.

Cross-validation involves splitting the dataset into multiple subsets called folds and then iteratively training the model on different combinations of these folds. This technique helps prevent overfitting and provides a better estimate of the model's generalization ability when applied to new datasets.
