The given context does not provide any direct information about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge, some commonly used techniques to address data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the original class proportions. Oversampling increases the number of instances in the minority class, while undersampling reduces the number of instances in the majority class. Both these methods aim to balance the classes in the dataset. Diverse data collection refers to collecting data from various sources to ensure that the model learns from different perspectives and avoids biases present in a single source.

However, without specific information regarding the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the query, I cannot provide a more detailed response.
