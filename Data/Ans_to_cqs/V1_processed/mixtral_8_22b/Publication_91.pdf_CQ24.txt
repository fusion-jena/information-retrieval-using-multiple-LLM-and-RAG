The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it does describe several techniques used to improve the performance and robustness of the model. These include using a large and diverse dataset, data augmentation techniques like flipping images horizontally or vertically, adjusting image properties like brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue, and employing a validation set during training to prevent overfitting. While these methods do not directly address handling randomness from sources like random seed values, they contribute to creating a more stable and reliable deep learning model. It is common practice in machine learning to use fixed random seeds when developing models to ensure reproducibility, but this aspect is not discussed in the given context.
