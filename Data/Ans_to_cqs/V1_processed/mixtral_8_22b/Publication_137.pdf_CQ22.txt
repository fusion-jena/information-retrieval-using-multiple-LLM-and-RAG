The overall accuracy (OA) is used as a metric to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this study. This metric measures how often the model's predictions match the actual values in the dataset. Other common evaluation metrics for deep learning models include precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the curve (AUC), but these were not mentioned in the given context.
