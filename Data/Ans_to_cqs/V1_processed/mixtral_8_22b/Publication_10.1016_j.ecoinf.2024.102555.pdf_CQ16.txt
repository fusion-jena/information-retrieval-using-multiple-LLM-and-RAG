The materials and methods section does not provide information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete for this particular study. However, common criteria used to determine when training is complete include a validation loss plateau, where the model's performance on the validation set stops improving; or early stopping, which involves monitoring the validation loss during training and stopping when it starts to increase, indicating overfitting. Other possible criteria could be reaching a predetermined number of epochs or achieving a target accuracy level. Without more specific information, it is not possible to definitively state what criteria were used in this case.
