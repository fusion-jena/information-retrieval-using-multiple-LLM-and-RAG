The text does not provide information about where the data repository for the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that the weights for DeeplabV3+ were obtained from an already trained implementation using the COCO dataset, but there is no mention of where this dataset can be accessed. Therefore, I do not know where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
