The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, based on the mention of sika deer identification, we can infer that the model is likely designed for object detection or classification tasks. Object detection involves identifying the presence and location of specific objects within an image, while classification focuses on categorizing images into different classes. Given that the goal is to identify sika deer, it suggests that the model aims to either detect the presence of sika deer in images or classify images containing sika deer.
