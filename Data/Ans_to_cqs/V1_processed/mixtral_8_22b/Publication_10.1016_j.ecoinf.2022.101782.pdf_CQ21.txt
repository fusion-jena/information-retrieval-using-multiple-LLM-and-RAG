The paper does not provide explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, some insights can be derived from the evaluation process mentioned in the paper. After training the model, the authors selected the best model based on minimal validation loss occurring at epoch 448. They then evaluated the performance of the red kite model based on an independent test set of 2060 images. From this, they obtained metrics such as training loss, training accuracy, validation loss, and validation accuracy. These metrics suggest that the authors calculated the performance of their model using standard machine learning metrics like loss and accuracy. Additionally, since the authors mention evaluating the model on an independent test set, it can be assumed that they followed common practices such as splitting the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets before training the model. However, without explicit details, it cannot be confirmed if techniques like saliency maps or confusion matrices were employed during postprocessing.
