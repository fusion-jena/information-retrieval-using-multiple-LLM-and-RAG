The information provided does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the given table (Table 1), it can be inferred that the dataset features include variables such as Soil Moisture, Pressure, Precipitation, Air Temperature, Relative Humidity, Wind Speed, Global Radiation, Reflected Radiation, Atmospheric Radiation, Emitted Radiation, Sensible Heat Flux, Latent Heat Flux, and Carbon Dioxide Flux. These variables suggest that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline might be numerical or tabular data, possibly in a structured format like CSV. Nevertheless, without explicit confirmation, this remains an educated guess.
