Based on the provided context, it appears that the authors utilize a publicly available dataset called EMDS-6 for their research. This dataset contains 840 different images of environmental microorganisms, divided into 21 categories with 40 images each. Therefore, it can be inferred that the method employed for gathering raw data in this particular deep learning pipeline involves utilizing pre-existing public datasets rather than collecting new data through means such as surveys or sensors. However, without additional information, it is not possible to determine whether the original creators of the EMDS-6 dataset gathered their data via surveys, sensors, or some other method.
