The text does not provide explicit details about a specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, it can be inferred from Tables 3, 4, 8, and 9 that the authors might have been using log-likelihood values, Cox & Snell R^2, Nagelkerke R^2, and classification tables to evaluate their models. Additionally, they could also use cross-validation techniques or holdout methods to assess the model's performance during training. Nevertheless, without further clarification from the original source, this remains speculative.
