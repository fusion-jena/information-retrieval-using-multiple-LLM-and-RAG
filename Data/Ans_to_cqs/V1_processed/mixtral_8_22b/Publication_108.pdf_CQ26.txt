Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, some aspects of the preprocessing steps mentioned could potentially help mitigate data bias. For instance, dividing each orthophoto into smaller tiles and creating separate datasets for training, validation, and testing may contribute to reducing bias if done appropriately. Additionally, the use of a larger amount of representative training data could improve the model's ability to generalize, thus indirectly addressing any potential biases in the data. Nonetheless, without concrete evidence from the provided context, one cannot definitively state what techniques are employed to tackle data bias during preprocessing.
