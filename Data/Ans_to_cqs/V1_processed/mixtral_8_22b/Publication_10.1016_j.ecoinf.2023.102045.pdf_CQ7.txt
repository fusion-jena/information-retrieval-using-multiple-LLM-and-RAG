The article does not provide direct information regarding the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (train, test, validation). However, generally speaking, the common practice is to randomly divide the available dataset into three subsets: training set, validation set, and testing set. The training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set is employed during the training process to fine-tune hyperparameters or select models. Lastly, the testing set is utilized after the model has been trained to evaluate its performance and generalizability. Typically, the ratio for splitting the datasets can be around 60% for training, 20% for validation, and 20% for testing, but it depends on the specific requirements and size of the dataset.
