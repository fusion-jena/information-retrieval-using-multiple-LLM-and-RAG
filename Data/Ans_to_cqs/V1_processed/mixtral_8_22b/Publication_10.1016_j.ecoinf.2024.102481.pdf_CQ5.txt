Based on the given context, it does not provide information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the context discusses the application of machine learning techniques, specifically the Random Forest (RF) method, to classify the reproductive condition in fish using extensive data from Chilean hake (Merluccius gayi gayi). The dataset consists of gonads randomly collected from commercial industrial and acoustic surveys, which were then classified into three maturity classes: immature, mature-active, and mature-inactive. Therefore, the dataset used in this study is related to fish reproduction and maturity rather than common deep learning datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
