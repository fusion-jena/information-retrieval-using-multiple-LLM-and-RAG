The data repository link of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, it does mention that the dataset was shared by Jiang et al. (2020) through the GitHub repository: <https://github.com/zhangchuanyin/weed-datasets>. Therefore, it can be assumed that the deep learning pipeline might also be available in the same repository or a related one. To confirm this, one would need to check the referenced paper or the GitHub repository directly.
