The text does not provide explicit information on the specific method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of a system for acoustically surveying cryptic species (Lambert & McDonald, 2014). This suggests that audio recordings might be one of the sources of raw data collection. Additionally, the study discusses the use of the BirdNET app, which is a machine learning-powered tool that enables citizen science participation (Wood et al., 2022). This implies that crowdsourced data could also be part of the raw data collection process. Lastly, the mention of a pipeline for identifying bird and frog species in tropical soundscape recordings (LeBien et al., 2020) further supports the idea that audio recordings are likely used for raw data collection.
