The data repository for this study can be found on the ITINERIS Critical Zone Virtual Research Environment, which is available on the D4Science e-Infrastructure. This virtual research environment includes all data, such as ESRI-GRID raster files, tables, images, animations, and data manipulation scripts. Additionally, it provides the list of species used to estimate species richness and the complete set of observation records. Free registration to the platform and the Virtual Research Environment is required.

However, it should be noted that while GBIF is mentioned as one of the sources of data used in this study, the specific data repository for the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly stated as being hosted on GBIF. Therefore, it cannot be definitively confirmed that the data repository is available on GBIF without further clarification or additional context.
