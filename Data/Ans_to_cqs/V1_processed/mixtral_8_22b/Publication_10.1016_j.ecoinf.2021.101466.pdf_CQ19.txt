The text mentions that Keras 2.4.3 is used to build all models. Keras is a high-level neural networks API written in Python, capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. Therefore, it can be inferred that one of these frameworks (TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano) is being used to build the deep learning model. However, the exact framework is not explicitly stated in the given information.
