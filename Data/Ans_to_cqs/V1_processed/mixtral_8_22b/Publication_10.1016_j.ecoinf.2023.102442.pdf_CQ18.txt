The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves selecting training sites based on several factors. These include using a previously created Landsat image collection as a basemap, applying a previously created cloud mask to avoid cloud-covered areas when selecting training sites, and utilizing a previously created cluster classification map as a further guide for class selection.

In this case, seventy training sites in the form of points (each point representing one pixel on the map) were selected for each of the five classes, making up a total of 350 points per image. The points were selected using a stratified (by class) random sampling approach and were distributed across the entire study area. This process ensures that the model is trained on a diverse set of data, reducing bias and improving overall performance.
