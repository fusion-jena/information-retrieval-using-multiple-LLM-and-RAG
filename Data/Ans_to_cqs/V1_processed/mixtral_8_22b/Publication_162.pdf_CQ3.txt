In the given context, there are several references to data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The authors mention using a standard deep learning classifier (ResNet-50) pre-trained on ImageNet, which suggests they have employed object classification techniques. They also discuss cropping bounding boxes around detected moths and training their model on these cropped images, indicating the use of bounding box annotations. Additionally, they refer to augmenting their training dataset with images obtained from internet search engines, implying some form of manual or semi-automatic annotation process.

Moreover, the authors describe making use of a feedback mechanism involving human users to optimize the system, suggesting the incorporation of active learning principles into their annotation workflow. Active learning involves selecting the most informative samples for manual annotation based on the current state of the model, thereby reducing overall labeling efforts while maintaining high performance.

Lastly, the authors briefly touch upon the concept of novelty detection, which could potentially involve another type of annotation technique aimed at identifying previously unseen classes or objects within the dataset. However, specific details regarding this aspect are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
