The information provided does not mention where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific location for it. It could be hosted on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket, but without further details, I can only suggest looking for it on these popular version control platforms.

Based on the given context, we can infer that this research paper discusses various environmental factors affecting biodiversity and uses machine learning techniques to analyze presence-only (PO) data from citizen science projects. The authors also acknowledge challenges related to analyzing PO data, such as species identification errors and over-aggregation of records. They propose a method to address these issues and improve predictions. However, no explicit reference is made to the availability of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in this study.
