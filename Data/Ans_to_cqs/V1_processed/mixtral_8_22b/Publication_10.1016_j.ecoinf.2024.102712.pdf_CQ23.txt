To ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model, the authors used the Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) approach. This method involves extracting one observation at a time from the dataset and estimating the model parameters using the remaining (n-1) observations. Afterward, the model is applied to the extracted observation. By employing this technique, the researchers aimed to minimize overfitting and improve the model's ability to perform well on unseen data. However, it should be noted that while LOOCV can help assess the model's performance across different subsets of the data, it does not directly address issues related to diversity within the dataset itself. Therefore, additional steps might have been necessary to ensure that the dataset was diverse enough to capture various aspects of the problem domain accurately. Unfortunately, the given context does not provide explicit details about any specific measures taken to guarantee the diversity of the dataset.
