Based on the given information, the performance of the deep learning models was evaluated using three main metrics: training accuracy, validation accuracy, and prediction accuracy. These metrics measure how well the models can correctly classify or predict the target variable based on the input features. Specifically, training accuracy measures the percentage of correct predictions made by the model on the training dataset, while validation accuracy evaluates the model's ability to generalize its learned patterns to new unseen data. Prediction accuracy, on the other hand, assesses the model's performance on real-world test data. In addition to these metrics, execution time was also considered as a factor affecting the overall efficiency of the models.
