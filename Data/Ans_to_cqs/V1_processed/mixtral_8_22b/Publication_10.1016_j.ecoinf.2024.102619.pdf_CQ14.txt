The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a k-fold (k=5) cross-validated fine grid-search on the training data. This process involves searching through a range of values for each hyperparameter and evaluating the performance of the model for each combination of hyperparameters. In this case, the hyperparameters searched for the non-linear RBF SVM were C = 2^(-3), 2^(-2.75),..., 2^(7) and gamma = 2^-13, 2^-11. Similarly, the same hyperparameter search was performed for the single parameter C of the linear SVM. Additionally, the RBF and linear SVM were also evaluated with different combinations of hyperparameters.
