The given context does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training such as train, test, or validation sets. However, it discusses various aspects related to machine learning and statistical analysis.

In general, when working with machine learning models like those mentioned in the text (Generalized Linear Model, Support Vector Machine, etc.), data is often divided into three subsets: training set, validation set, and testing set. This division helps evaluate the model's performance and prevent overfitting.

The training set is used to fit the model, i.e., to learn from the data. The validation set is used during the model development phase to fine-tune hyperparameters and select the best model. It provides feedback on how well the model is performing while it is being developed. Lastly, the testing set is used after the model has been fully specified to estimate its performance on unseen data.

Common ratios for splitting the data include 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing, but these can be adjusted based on the specific requirements and size of the dataset. Cross-validation techniques may also be employed to further improve the robustness of the model evaluation process.
