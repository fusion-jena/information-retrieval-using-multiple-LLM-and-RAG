The article does not provide specific information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as dealing with random seed values. However, some common strategies used in general include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using ensemble methods or cross-validation to reduce variance caused by random initialization, and employing techniques like dropout regularization to prevent overfitting due to randomness. These strategies help maintain consistency and robustness in deep learning models despite inherent randomness.
