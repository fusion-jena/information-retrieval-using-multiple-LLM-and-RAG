The data was split using a Leave-One-Group-Out (LOGO) cross-validation approach. Each complete 450m multitemporal transect was considered as a single group. For each iteration, one entire group was left out for testing while the rest of the groups were used for training. This process was repeated until each group had been used as a test set exactly once. Additionally, a broader and more conservative testing strategy was adopted by excluding three transects (~17% of the data) for testing in each iteration, specifically one from each target class - "Plateau" (p), "White-sand" (w), and "Riparian" (r). To evaluate the model's performance across all transects, a cumulative evaluation was performed using coefficient of determination (R^2) between true vs predicted values for all 648 multitemporal transect predictions.
