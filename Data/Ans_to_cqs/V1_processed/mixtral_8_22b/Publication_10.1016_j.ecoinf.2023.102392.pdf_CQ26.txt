In the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it can be inferred that the researchers have employed some form of data preprocessing since they have used Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for land use/land cover classification and forest types identification.

Data preprocessing is crucial before applying machine learning algorithms like XGBoost to ensure accurate results. Techniques such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and collecting diverse datasets can help mitigate data biases. These methods aim to balance class distribution, reduce overfitting, improve generalizability, and increase overall model performance.

Stratified sampling involves dividing the dataset into subsets based on target variables, ensuring each subset has roughly equal representation. Oversampling increases minority class samples, while undersampling reduces majority class samples to achieve balanced classes. Collecting diverse datasets helps capture various scenarios and patterns, reducing potential biases caused by limited data sources.

Although not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, these techniques could potentially be applied during the preprocessing stage of the deep learning pipeline to address data bias. It would depend on the nature of the dataset and the specific requirements of the research project.
