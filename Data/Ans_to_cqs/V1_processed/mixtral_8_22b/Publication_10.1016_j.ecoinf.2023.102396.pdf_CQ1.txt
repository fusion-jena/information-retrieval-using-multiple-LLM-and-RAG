Based on the given context, it appears that the raw data used in this study were collected through wildlife harvest summaries compiled by the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks. These summaries included information about the number of harvested rabbits per hunter day, which served as a capture per unit effort (CPUE) index. This method of data collection suggests that the researchers relied on existing records or reports rather than conducting their own surveys or using sensors. However, without additional context, it cannot be definitively stated whether other sources of data, such as public datasets, were also utilized in the deep learning pipeline.
