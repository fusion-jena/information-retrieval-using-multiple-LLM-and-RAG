Unfortunately, there isn't any information about data annotation techniques used in the given context. However, I can provide general information about common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. These include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, landmark annotation, and image classification. Each technique serves a unique purpose depending on the problem being solved. For example, bounding box annotation is often used for object detection tasks, while semantic segmentation is used for pixel-level labeling of images. Instance segmentation combines both object detection and semantic segmentation, allowing for individual objects within an image to be identified and labeled separately. Polygon annotation involves drawing shapes around objects or areas of interest, while key point annotation focuses on identifying specific points within an image. Landmark annotation is similar to key point annotation but is typically used for facial recognition tasks. Image classification involves assigning labels to entire images rather than individual pixels or objects.
