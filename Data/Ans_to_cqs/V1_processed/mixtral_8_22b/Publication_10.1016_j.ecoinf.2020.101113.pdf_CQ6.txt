Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it can be inferred that the authors performed some form of preprocessing to ensure that their input images were equally sized. This was necessary because the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model they used required equally sized input images. They chose a time-frequency input window size of 2 seconds, which was close to the mean and median template duration across target call types. Additionally, since most call types had durations below 1 second, and those above 2 seconds needed to be adjusted accordingly. Therefore, while the exact preprocessing steps aren't mentioned, resizing the input images to fit the chosen window size would have been a crucial step in preparing the data for training the deep learning model.
