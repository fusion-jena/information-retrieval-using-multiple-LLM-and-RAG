The context does not provide explicit information on the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, based on common machine learning practices, some possible criteria include reaching a certain number of epochs, achieving a desired accuracy or loss value, or observing no further improvement in validation loss over several epochs (validation loss plateau). Without specific details about the training process mentioned in the context, it cannot be definitively stated what criteria were used to determine completion.
