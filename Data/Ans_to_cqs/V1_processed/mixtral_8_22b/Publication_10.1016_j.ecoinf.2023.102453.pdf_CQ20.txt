Unfortunately, the given context does not explicitly mention the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It only discusses the model optimization techniques, such as neural architecture search (NAS) and hyperparameter optimization, along with the use of EfficientNetV2B0 model. However, it does not specify whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware resources were utilized during the training process.
