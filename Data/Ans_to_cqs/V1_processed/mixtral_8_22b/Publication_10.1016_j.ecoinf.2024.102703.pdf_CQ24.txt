To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed. One common approach is using a fixed random seed value across multiple runs or experiments. By setting a specific seed value, researchers can ensure reproducibility and consistency in their results. Another strategy involves performing multiple runs with different random seeds and then averaging the outcomes to reduce the effect of randomness. Additionally, techniques such as cross-validation and bootstrapping can help mitigate the impact of randomness by providing more robust estimates of performance metrics. Lastly, some libraries offer deterministic algorithms that do not rely on random number generation, ensuring consistent results regardless of the seed value.
