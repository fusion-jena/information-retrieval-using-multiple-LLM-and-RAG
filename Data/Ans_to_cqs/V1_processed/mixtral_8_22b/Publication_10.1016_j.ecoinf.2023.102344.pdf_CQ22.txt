The table presented in the given context provides the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of various deep learning models. These metrics include Accuracy, Fall-out, Precision, Specificity, Recall, and F1-score. Each metric offers insights into different aspects of the model's performance.

Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of the total number of instances. It gives a general idea about how well the model performs overall. However, it may not be reliable when dealing with imbalanced datasets.

Fall-out represents the ratio of false positives to the sum of true negatives and false positives. A lower fall-out value indicates better performance.

Precision, also known as positive predictive value, calculates the fraction of relevant instances among the retrieved instances. In other words, it shows the percentage of correctly predicted positive observations out of the total predicted positives.

Specificity, or True Negative Rate, determines the proportion of actual negative cases that are correctly identified. It helps understand the model's ability to identify negative instances accurately.

Recall, or sensitivity, measures the proportion of actual positive cases that are correctly identified. It reflects the model's capacity to find all positive instances.

The F1-score combines both precision and recall into a single metric, providing a more balanced view of the model's performance. It is particularly useful when dealing with imbalanced classes.
