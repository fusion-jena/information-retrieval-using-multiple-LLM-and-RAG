The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps taken before training a deep learning model. However, it does discuss the use of data augmentation techniques to improve the performance of deep learning models. Data augmentation involves creating modified copies of a dataset using existing data to increase and diversify the training data. This helps prevent overfitting and improves the generalization ability of the network. Additionally, the text mentions the implementation of an attention mechanism to enable precise focusing on relevant input elements, enhancing the performance of the proposed model. It also describes the division of data into five equal folds and the evaluation of optimal augment policies using a Bayesian optimizer. While these steps do not directly address preprocessing tasks such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning, they highlight the importance of preparing and manipulating datasets to achieve improved performance in deep learning models.
