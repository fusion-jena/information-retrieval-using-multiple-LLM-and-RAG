The text does not provide explicit details about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of Python and FastAI for developing the deep learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). In general, when working with deep learning models, techniques such as setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using deterministic algorithms where possible, and averaging results from multiple runs with different initializations can be employed to manage randomness. These methods help ensure consistent results and reduce variability due to random factors like initialization weights and training data order.
