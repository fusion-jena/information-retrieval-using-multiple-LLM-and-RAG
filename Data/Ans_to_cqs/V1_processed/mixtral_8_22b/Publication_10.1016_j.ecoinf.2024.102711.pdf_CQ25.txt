In the given context, there isn't explicit information regarding the specific purpose or type of the deep learning model being used, such as classification, segmentation, or detection. However, we do know that the study employs two AutoML models, AutoGluon and TabPFN, with the goal of improving model accuracy and enhancing prediction performance through optimal hyperparameter selection.

Hyperparameters play a crucial role in optimizing the learning process of data-driven models. By employing methods like k-fold cross-validation and grid search, researchers can fine-tune their models by selecting the most effective hyperparameters. In this particular study, the influential hyperparameters being adjusted include the maximum depth of the tree, the number of trees in the ensemble model, and the learning rate.

While the exact purpose of the deep learning model remains unclear based on the provided context, it is evident that the primary objective is to improve overall model performance and achieve better predictions. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of addressing issues like overfitting when working with smaller datasets, emphasizing the significance of evaluating model performance against an independent dataset rather than relying solely on the model development dataset.
