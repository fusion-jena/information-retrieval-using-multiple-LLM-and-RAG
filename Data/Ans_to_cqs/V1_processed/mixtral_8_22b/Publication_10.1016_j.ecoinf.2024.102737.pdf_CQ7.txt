Based on the given context, it appears that the dataset was divided into training and testing sets for the purpose of developing deep learning models. However, the exact criteria used to split the data are not explicitly mentioned. From Table 2, we can see that the training set sizes vary across different experiments, ranging from 24 to 120 samples. Similarly, the test set sizes range from 66 to 68 samples. This suggests that the splitting may have been done randomly or based on certain proportions rather than any specific criteria related to the data itself. Additionally, no mention of a separate validation set is made in the provided context. Therefore, without further information, it cannot be definitively stated what criteria were used to split the data for deep learning model training.
