Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The sources cited do not provide any direct reference to a specific data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
