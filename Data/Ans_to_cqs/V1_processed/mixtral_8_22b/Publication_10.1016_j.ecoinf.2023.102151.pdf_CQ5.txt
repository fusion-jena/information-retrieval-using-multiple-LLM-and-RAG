The given context does not provide specific details about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of existing remote sensing data and web-based APIs, specifically referencing the resource Crop-CASMA for US soil moisture data. It suggests the possibility of developing integrated data streaming pipelines for visualizing soil information at varying degrees of granularity. Additionally, it discusses the potential benefits of identifying a unified data framework with global applicability, although uncertainty exists regarding its feasibility. Unfortunately, without more explicit information, it is impossible to determine the exact datasets utilized in their deep learning pipeline.
