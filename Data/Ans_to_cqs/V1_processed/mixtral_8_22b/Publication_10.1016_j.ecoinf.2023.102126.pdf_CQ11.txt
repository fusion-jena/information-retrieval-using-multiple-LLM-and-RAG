Unfortunately, there isn't enough information provided to determine the specific data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the given context, it appears that some possible data repositories include Figshare (<https://figshare.com/>), Zenodo (<https://zenodo.org/>), Dryad (<https://datadryad.org/stash>), and CSIRO (<https://data.csiro.au/>). These are among the top eight repositories with the highest number of datasets deposited, accounting for nearly 95% of all datasets. It should be noted that the context does not mention any specific deep learning pipelines or their respective links. Therefore, additional information would be required to provide a definitive answer.
