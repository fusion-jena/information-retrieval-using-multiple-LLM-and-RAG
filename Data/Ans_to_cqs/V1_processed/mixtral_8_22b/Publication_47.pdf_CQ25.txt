The purpose of the deep learning model, referred to as IUC-NN, is to predict the conservation status of unevaluated orchid species. This model was developed using a deep neural network algorithm and is based on four groups of features derived from digital occurrence records. These include geographical, climatic, biome, and anthropogenic factors. The goal of this model is to aid in assessing the conservation needs of various orchid species and identifying areas of high extinction risk.
