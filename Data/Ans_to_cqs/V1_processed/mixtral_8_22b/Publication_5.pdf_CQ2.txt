Based on the given information, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images. This is indicated by several clues in the text. Firstly, the authors mention that their proposed models were based on the most typical type of neural network, using pixel-wise inputs. Pixel-wise inputs are typically associated with image data, where each pixel represents a specific color intensity value. Secondly, the authors discuss the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which are commonly applied to image recognition tasks. Lastly, they compare their deep learning approach to Random Forest regression, which has been previously used to model vascular plant species richness using LiDAR data in a natural forest. LiDAR data is often represented as point clouds or raster images, further supporting the idea that the input data for the deep learning pipeline is likely in image format. However, without explicit confirmation from the authors, it cannot be definitively stated that other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV files were not also utilized in the deep learning pipeline.
