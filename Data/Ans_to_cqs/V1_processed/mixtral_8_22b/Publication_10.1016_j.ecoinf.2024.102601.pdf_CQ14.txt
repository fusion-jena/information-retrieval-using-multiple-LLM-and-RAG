The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using two predominant models - RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV from the scikit-learn library. Initially, RandomizedSearchCV is used to perform a broad exploration of the hyperparameter space. This method offers a computational advantage by evaluating only a user-specified subset of hyperparameter combinations. It is beneficial when there is uncertainty about the optimal values or when dealing with large hyperparameter spaces. After this initial exploration, GridSearchCV is employed to conduct an exhaustive search around the best hyperparameters found by RandomizedSearchCV. GridSearchCV guarantees that the optimal parameter combination within the grid is identified, making it valuable when the hyperparameter space is relatively smaller and well-defined. By combining these two methods, an optimal balance between computational efficiency and search precision can be achieved.
