The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is for plant identification, specifically medicinal plants from similar poisonous plants. The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture and incorporates an attention mechanism called Tree-CA to improve its performance. The primary goal of this model is to accurately classify images of various plant species, which is evident from the evaluation criteria mentioned, such as accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1-score. Therefore, the main objective of this deep learning model is plant image classification.
