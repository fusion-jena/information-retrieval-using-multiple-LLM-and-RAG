In the given context, the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images. This is evident from the mention of using a YOLOV4 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze more than 58,000 images taken by an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). Additionally, the testing dataset consists of 500 manually annotated images, further emphasizing the use of images in the deep learning process. Furthermore, the model outputs its predictions in a JSON file containing bounding boxes and confidence scores for each detected object within the analyzed images. However, it should be noted that while the context primarily focuses on image data, other types of data such as CSV or audio files could also potentially be integrated into the deep learning pipeline depending on the specific application and objectives of the project.
