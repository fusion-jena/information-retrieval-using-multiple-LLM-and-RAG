Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information regarding the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, considering the nature of the research and its application to ecological monitoring projects, one could infer that the raw data might include images or videos collected through various means such as camera traps, drones, or other remote sensing devices commonly employed in wildlife studies. Additionally, the mention of a large dataset consisting of approximately 5.5 million images suggests that publicly available datasets may also contribute to the pool of raw data. Nevertheless, without further details, this remains speculative.
