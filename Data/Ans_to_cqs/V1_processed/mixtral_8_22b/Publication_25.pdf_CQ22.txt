The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, based on common practices in machine learning and deep learning, some possible evaluation metrics could include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, and area under the curve (AUC). Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of total predictions made. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made. Recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positives. F1 score combines both precision and recall into a single metric. ROC curve plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate, while AUC represents the area under this curve. These metrics would depend on the specific task and dataset being used.
