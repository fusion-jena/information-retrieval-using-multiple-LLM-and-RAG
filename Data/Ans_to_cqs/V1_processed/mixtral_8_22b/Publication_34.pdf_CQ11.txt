The text does not provide information about the specific data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the authors might have used citizen science programs or national museums, herbaria, and conservatories as sources for their plant species observations. They also mentioned using a high number of randomly chosen species from an initial set of 7626 species, selecting species with more than 300 observations, and creating subsets of 1000, 200, and 50 species. Unfortunately, without additional context or access to the original research paper, I cannot provide a direct link to the data repository.
