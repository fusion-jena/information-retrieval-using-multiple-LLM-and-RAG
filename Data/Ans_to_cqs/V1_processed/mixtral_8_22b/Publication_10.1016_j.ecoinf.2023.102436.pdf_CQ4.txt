The given context does not provide information about specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotating, scaling, etc. However, it discusses various studies related to landscape analysis and visualization using different methodologies including convolutional neural networks, computational simulations, and 3D modeling. These studies aim to assess and track landscape visual quality, extract and represent spatial attributes, and evaluate multi-spatial environmental performance. Unfortunately, there is no mention of any data augmentation techniques used in these studies.
