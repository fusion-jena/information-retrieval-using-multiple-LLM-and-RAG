The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices. However, based on general machine learning practices, some common postprocessing steps could include evaluating the trained model using various performance metrics like precision, recall, F1 score, etc., visualizing results through techniques like saliency maps or heatmaps, and creating confusion matrices to understand misclassifications better. These steps help assess the model's effectiveness and identify areas for improvement.
