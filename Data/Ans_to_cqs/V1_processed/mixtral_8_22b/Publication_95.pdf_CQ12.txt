The text mentions that a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is used in the pipeline. Specifically, two network structures are mentioned: one based on VGG16 and another based on ResNet50V2. Both of these architectures are well-known types of CNNs commonly used for image classification tasks. The final classification layer of these networks was adapted to match the seven classes relevant to this study. The networks were then trained on five different image sizes, using either random weights or weights pre-trained on ImageNet. The Adam optimizer was employed for training, along with cross-entropy loss.
