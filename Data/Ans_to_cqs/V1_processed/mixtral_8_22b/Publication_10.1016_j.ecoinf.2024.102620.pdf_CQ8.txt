The information provided does not mention any specific code repositories for a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer to where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it can be noted that some datasets used in this research are accessed through Google Earth Engine's code editor, which suggests that the authors might have utilized Google Cloud Platform or similar services for their work. It would be best to contact the authors directly or check their published papers for more details on the availability of their code repository.
