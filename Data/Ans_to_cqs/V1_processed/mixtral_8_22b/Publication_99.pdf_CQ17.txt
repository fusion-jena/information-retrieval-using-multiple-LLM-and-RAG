To prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, several regularization methods can be employed. One common method mentioned in the given context is dropout. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to make the model more robust and prevents it from relying too heavily on any one feature. In the case of the classification networks described in the context, a dropout layer with a dropout ratio of 0.5 was used as a network regularizer.

Additionally, another form of regularization not explicitly mentioned but implied through the use of certain optimization algorithms is weight decay or L2 regularization. Weight decay adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the sum of squares of all the weights in the network. This encourages smaller weights and discourages complex models, thus helping to reduce overfitting. Optimizers like Adam, which is used in the given context, often incorporate some form of weight decay or L2 regularization.

Other forms of regularization include early stopping, which involves monitoring the performance of the model on a validation set during training and halting the training process once the validation error starts increasing; and data augmentation, which involves applying random transformations to the input data to create additional training examples and increase the diversity of the training set. Data augmentation techniques such as height and width shifts, flips, zooms, and brightness changes were employed in the given context for training the classification networks.
