The text mentions that an object detection network (YOLOv5) was trained on a manually annotated subset of the data. It can be inferred that the annotation technique used here is bounding box annotation since YOLOv5 is a popular object detection algorithm known for its use of bounding boxes around detected objects. After training, this network was applied for detection on the remaining images. However, due to the small and unbalanced nature of the dataset, the detection of pollen-bearing bees was often missed. As a result, the outcomes went through manual verification to establish the ground truth bounding boxes. This iterative process led to a dataset consisting of 2,051 images, which included 1,758 pollen-bearing bees and 59,068 non-pollen-bearing bees. Therefore, it appears that the primary data annotation technique employed in this deep learning pipeline is bounding box annotation.
