The primary focus of the described system is on processing and analyzing large, high-bit-rate datasets such as audio and image streams. Specifically, they use 16-bit stereo audio recorded at a sample rate of 22,000 samples per second (22 kHz), and 2048-by-1536 8-bit 4:2:2 color images. These data formats are used in their deep learning pipeline for tasks such as classifying the presence or absence of different endangered species and tracking populations of invasive snakes. They employ deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and deep feedforward neural networks (DNNs) to process audio spectrogram and image data.
