Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as using a specific random seed value. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a helpful answer based solely on the provided context.

However, some common strategies used to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines include setting a fixed random seed value, which ensures reproducibility by initializing the same weights and biases each time the code runs. Another strategy is to use deterministic algorithms instead of stochastic ones wherever possible. Additionally, techniques like cross-validation can be used to reduce the impact of randomness on model performance. But again, without further context or information, it is impossible to determine if any of these strategies were employed in the development of the UODN network.
