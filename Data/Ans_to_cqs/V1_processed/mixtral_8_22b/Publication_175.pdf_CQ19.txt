The text does not explicitly mention which specific framework or library was used to build the deep learning model. However, since they mentioned using ResNet 100 (He et al., 2016), it can be assumed that popular deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch were likely used due to their wide adoption and support for pretrained models like ResNet. Nonetheless, without explicit information about the framework used, it cannot be definitively stated whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or another framework was utilized.
