The text does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions that the FIT method employs a robust cross-validated discriminant analysis in an iterative approach where each pair combination of trails is held back as the test set, with the rest of the remaining trails used as the training set model. This suggests that some form of cross-validation might be used to evaluate the performance of the model during training. Additionally, the use of stepwise forward regression implies that variable selection is performed during the training process. Nevertheless, without more detailed information, it cannot be definitively stated what exact criteria are used to determine when training is complete.
