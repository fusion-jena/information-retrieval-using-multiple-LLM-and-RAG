The information provided does not contain specific details about the hyperparameters used in any deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the learning rate or optimizer used in this case. However, common hyperparameters in deep learning include learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, optimizers like Adam, SGD, etc. These parameters can significantly impact the performance of the model and need to be tuned carefully based on the problem and dataset.
