Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about the specific purpose of the deep learning model used in these studies. However, we can infer some possible purposes based on the general use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and machine learning models in similar applications.

In the study by De Lucia et al. (2022), they discuss using explainable AI for hyperspectral image classification in edge computing environments. While not explicitly stated, this suggests that their deep learning model might be used for image classification tasks. Similarly, Domingues et al. (2020) mention using artificial neural networks on integrated multispectral and SAR data for high-performance prediction of eucalyptus biomass. In this case, the deep learning model could be employed for regression tasks, such as estimating biomass quantities.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are widely used for various tasks like classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. They consist of multiple layers of interconnected nodes called neurons, which process and transmit signals. One popular type of ANN architecture mentioned in the context is the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. During the training phase of MLPNN, initial arbitrary connection weights are assigned, and inputs are fed forward from the input to the hidden layer. The results propagate to the output layer, where output values are compared to expected values for error computation. Through iterative error back-propagation, connection weights are adjusted until reaching a target minimal error. Once trained, the network can estimate outputs for both training and new input data without requiring additional training data.

While the exact purpose of the deep learning model in these studies remains unclear due to limited context, it is reasonable to assume that they may have been used for tasks such as image classification, object detection, or regression analysis based on the broader application of ANNs and machine learning models in related fields.
