The majority of articles using GPU computing for machine learning in ecology involve training phases that can be easily parallelized. This suggests that GPUs are commonly used for training deep learning models due to their ability to handle parallel processing efficiently. Software tools like TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch, which extend the Python programming language, have been widely utilized for this purpose. These tools enable users to leverage the power of GPUs for training deep learning models. Therefore, it can be concluded that GPUs are frequently employed as hardware resources for training deep learning models in the field of ecology.
