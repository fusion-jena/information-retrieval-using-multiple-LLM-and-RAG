Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does reference the Microsoft Common Objects in Context (MS COCO) dataset, which was introduced by Lin et al. in their paper published in 2014. MS COCO is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset containing over 330K images and 1.5 million object instances across 80 categories. Additionally, the context mentions a lightweight vehicle detection network model proposed by Dong et al. in August 2022, but it does not provide any further details about the dataset used for this particular model. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, only the MS COCO dataset can be confirmed as having been used in the deep learning pipeline.
