The given context does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses the methods employed for separating data into training and testing datasets, subsetting background points, and training individual models for ensemble models. These processes involve dividing the study area into blocks, selecting background points, and utilizing various modeling approaches such as GLMs, GAMs, MARS, RF, ANN, and MaxEnt. Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot determine the exact data annotation techniques used in their deep learning pipeline.
