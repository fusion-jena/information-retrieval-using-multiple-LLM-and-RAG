The article mentions that a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used in their pipeline. Specifically, they use a ResNet50 architecture that was pre-trained on the ImageNet classification dataset. Additionally, they mention using a segmentation network, which is likely another form of CNN designed specifically for semantic segmentation tasks.
