The information provided does not explicitly state the hyperparameters used in the deep learning models such as learning rate, optimizer, etc. It only mentions that the hyperparameters were set up as in Bean et al. (2012), but it doesn't provide details about what those hyperparameters are. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this query with the given context.
