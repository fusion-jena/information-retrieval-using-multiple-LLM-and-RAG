The paper primarily focuses on the application of deep learning techniques in classifying wetlands from remote sensing images. Therefore, the primary data format used in this study is image data. Specifically, the authors use multi-source optical satellite imagery for spectral analysis of wetlands. Additionally, they employ various deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViT), Swin Transformers (ST), CoAtNet, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), and 3DUNetGSFormer, which are all designed to process image data. However, it should be noted that these deep learning architectures could also be adapted to work with other types of data, such as audio or video, depending on the specific task requirements.
