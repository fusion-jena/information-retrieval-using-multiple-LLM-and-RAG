Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some general strategies can be mentioned based on common practices in the field.

One strategy to manage randomness is using fixed seeds for reproducibility. By setting a specific seed value, researchers can ensure that their results remain consistent across different runs of the same experiment. This approach helps maintain consistency when comparing models or evaluating performance.

Another strategy involves employing cross-validation techniques, which involve splitting the dataset into multiple subsets for training and testing purposes. Cross-validation methods like k-fold cross-validation help reduce variability caused by random sampling during the creation of these subsets.

Additionally, ensemble methods can also mitigate the effects of randomness. Ensemble methods combine multiple models to produce more robust and accurate predictions. Techniques such as bagging and boosting create diverse sets of models, reducing the impact of random initialization and improving overall performance.

Lastly, hyperparameter optimization plays a crucial role in minimizing the effect of randomness. Grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization methods can be utilized to find the best combination of hyperparameters for a particular problem. These methods systematically explore the parameter space, helping to identify optimal configurations that lead to better model performance.
