Based on the given context, the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline primarily involve text and images. Specifically, the study uses the 'Full-archive search endpoint' to access the entire dataset published on Twitter, which includes both text and images. The text data is handled in JSON format returned by the Twitter API, utilizing the twarc2 library for easier management. Additionally, the study mentions the use of natural language processing techniques, further emphasizing the importance of text data. Regarding images, the study discusses the need to eliminate tweets containing images in GIF format, suggesting that non-GIF images may be part of the analysis. However, the context does not explicitly mention any specific format for these images. Therefore, based on the available information, the primary data formats used in the deep learning pipeline appear to be text (JSON) and images.
