The given context does not provide specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for this particular project. However, generally speaking, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and landmark annotation. These techniques help label or tag datasets so they can be used to train machine learning models effectively. Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangles around objects within images to identify them. Semantic segmentation labels each pixel in an image according to its class, while instance segmentation identifies individual instances of objects. Polygon annotation uses shapes other than rectangles to outline objects more precisely. Key point annotation marks specific points on objects, such as joints on humans, and landmark annotation identifies important features like facial features.
