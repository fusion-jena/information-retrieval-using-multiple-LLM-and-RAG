The paper does not provide explicit details about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, based on common practices in machine learning projects, we can infer some possible postprocessing steps. These may include:

1. Evaluation metrics: After training the models, it is essential to evaluate their performance using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc. These metrics help assess how well the models have learned to classify or predict the target variable.

2. Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix is often used to visualize the performance of classification models. It provides insights into the number of correct and incorrect predictions made by the model.

3. Saliency Maps: Saliency maps highlight the regions in the input image that contribute most significantly to the output prediction. They can be useful for understanding what features the model has learned to focus on while making decisions.

4. Hyperparameter tuning: Postprocessing might also involve optimizing hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, epochs, etc., to improve the model's performance further.

5. Ensembling: As mentioned in the paper, they use an ensemble of two independent models - EfficientNet Vision Transformer Transfer Learned and Decision Tree. Therefore, postprocessing could also involve combining these models' outputs to generate final predictions.
