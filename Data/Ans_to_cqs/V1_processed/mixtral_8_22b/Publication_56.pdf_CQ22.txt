Although the given context does not explicitly mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, it does indicate that precision indicators are commonly reported in studies involving deep learning approaches for remote sensing data analysis. However, without further information, we cannot definitively state which specific metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., were used in this particular case. It should also be noted that interpretability of the predictions is another important aspect mentioned in the context, which is often evaluated separately from traditional performance metrics.
