The text does not explicitly mention the specific optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does provide some clues about the methods employed to improve the model's performance. For instance, the authors use a two-stage training process, where the first stage involves training only a top classifier (fully connected layer) based on features extracted from processing images with a pretrained convolutional part of the network. This suggests that they might have used transfer learning, leveraging pretrained models like VGG or ResNet, which often employ optimizers like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam).

In the second stage, the network undergoes fine-tuning with smaller learning rates, indicating that the initial learning rate could be higher during the first stage. Fine-tuning allows the model to learn additional features specific to their dataset, improving its overall performance. Although the exact optimization technique isn't mentioned, this process implies the usage of adaptive learning rate algorithms like Adam or RMSprop.

Moreover, the authors apply data augmentation by randomly deforming input images in each training cycle to address the issue of having a small sample size. Data augmentation helps prevent overfitting and improves the model's generalization capabilities. Additionally, dropout techniques are utilized to enhance model robustness by preventing complex co-adaptations between neurons. Dropout can be considered a regularization method rather than an optimization technique, but it still contributes significantly to enhancing the model's performance.

In conclusion, while the text doesn't directly state the optimization techniques used, it hints at possible methods like SGD, Adam, or other adaptive learning rate algorithms through the application of transfer learning, fine-tuning, and data augmentation.
