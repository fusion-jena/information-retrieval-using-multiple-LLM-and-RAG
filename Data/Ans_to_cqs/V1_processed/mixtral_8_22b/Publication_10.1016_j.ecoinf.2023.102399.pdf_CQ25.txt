The purpose of the deep learning model used in the given context is for high-quality target detection. This was crucial in dealing with the complexities of the underwater environment when estimating fish biomass. Specifically, the deep learning network was employed to detect fish bodies accurately, which allowed for better estimation of their weights by considering the fish body area as a parameter. This approach improved accuracy compared to traditional methods, resulting in a mean relative error (MRE) of only 3.44%. Additionally, the use of the deep learning model helped minimize the workload and complexity of image preprocessing, thus enhancing the efficiency and robustness of body weight estimation.
