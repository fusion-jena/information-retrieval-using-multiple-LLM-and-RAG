The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is primarily for classification tasks. Specifically, it aims to identify bird sounds using a Phylogenetic Perspective Neural Network (PPNN). The model employs a hierarchical semantic embedding framework to capture feature information at different levels, utilizing attention mechanisms to enhance its ability to distinguish between various bird calls. The ultimate goal is to train the model to recognize bird sounds accurately, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling complex audio data.
