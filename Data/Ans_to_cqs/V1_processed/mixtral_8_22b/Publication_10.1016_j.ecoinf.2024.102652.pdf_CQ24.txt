Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some common strategies to manage randomness include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using techniques like k-fold cross-validation or bootstrapping to reduce variability due to random sampling, and employing ensemble methods to combine multiple models trained with different initializations. These strategies help improve model performance and robustness by reducing the impact of random factors during training.
