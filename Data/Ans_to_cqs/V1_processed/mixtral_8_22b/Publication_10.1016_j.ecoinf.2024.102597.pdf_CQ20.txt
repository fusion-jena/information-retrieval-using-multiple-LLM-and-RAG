The text does not provide explicit information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. However, it mentions that a GPU was not used for training the CatBoost model, suggesting that the authors might have used CPUs instead. Nevertheless, without further details, it cannot be definitively stated what hardware resources were employed for training the other models.

Based on the given context, the author mentioned that they didn't use a GPU for training the CatBoost model. However, there is no clear mention of any other hardware resource being used for training the deep learning models such as GPUs or TPUs. Therefore, it can only be speculated that perhaps CPUs were utilized for training these models.
