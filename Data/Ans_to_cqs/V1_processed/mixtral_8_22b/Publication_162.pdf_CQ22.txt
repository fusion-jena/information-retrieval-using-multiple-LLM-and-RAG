The performance of the deep learning model, specifically D-Mask R-CNN, is evaluated using several metrics. These include Average Precision (AP), AP50, and AP75. AP refers to the average precision over Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds ranging from 50 to 95 percent in 5 percent increments. On the other hand, AP50 and AP75 denote the average precision at an intersection over union (IoU) threshold of 50 and 75 percent respectively. Additionally, a standard deep learning classifier (ResNet-50) was employed to train on cropped bounding box images of detected objects, achieving an average accuracy of 89.00 percent on a held-out test set.
