The text does not provide information about specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the LST dataset was derived from infrared radiations measured on channels 31 and 32 using the MODIS-TERRA sensor. The data was obtained from the MOD11A2 product, offering 8-day temporal and 1 km spatial resolutions covering 2005-2018. Additionally, the study utilized the NARX feedback ANN model to define vegetation biomass density for 2030, developing a hybrid model by combining wavelet analysis and the NARX ANN algorithm to enhance its performance.
