After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be taken to evaluate and enhance the performance of the trained model. These may include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, creating confusion matrices, and performing post-classification refinements.

Saliency maps help visualize which parts of the input data contribute most significantly to the model's predictions. They provide insights into how the model makes decisions by highlighting important features or regions in the input data.

Metrics calculation involves computing various evaluation measures such as precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy to quantify the model's performance. These metrics enable comparison between different models and configurations, helping researchers choose the best model for their specific task.

Confusion matrices offer a more detailed view of the model's performance by summarizing its correct and incorrect classifications across all classes. By analyzing the confusion matrix, it becomes possible to identify patterns in misclassifications and focus on improving those aspects during further model development.

Post-classification refinement refers to any adjustments made to the output labels based on domain knowledge or external information. In the given context, post-classification refinement was undertaken to improve the classification for certain classes and areas, such as swamps in southern Pembrokeshire. Additional training data was collected from misclassified areas through aerial photograph interpretation and targeted field visits. After reclassifying the vegetation types (VTs), the final nine-class VT map was generated.

These postprocessing steps play crucial roles in assessing and enhancing the quality of machine learning models, ensuring they meet desired standards before deployment in real-world applications.
