The article does not provide explicit details about the specific datasets used in their deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions several related works that use various datasets for different purposes. For instance, Gao et al. (2019) discuss pixel transposed convolutional networks, while Huang et al. (2016) present a method for automated fish length measurement and water drop detection. Additionally, Jalal et al. (2020) focus on fish detection and species classification in underwater environments using deep learning with temporal information. These studies may utilize popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, depending on their objectives and requirements. Nevertheless, without further information from the authors, we cannot definitively state which datasets were employed in their research.
