Based on the provided context, there is no information about specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the study uses a dataset containing ecological data, possibly related to sounds or images based on the use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and references to image processing. Unfortunately, without explicit mention of the dataset name, we cannot provide a definitive answer.
