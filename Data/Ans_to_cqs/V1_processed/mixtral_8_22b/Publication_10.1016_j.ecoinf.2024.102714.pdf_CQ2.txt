The information provided does not explicitly state the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that vector datasets are utilized, which typically include spatial data such as points, lines, or polygons. These datasets may contain various types of geospatial information, including peat depth maps, phase-1 habitat surveys, digital elevation models, saltmarsh layers, mean high water spring tides, and national forest inventory data. Additionally, the use of the EarthTrack mobile application suggests that GPS coordinates might be collected during field surveys. Based on this information, it appears that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline would likely involve some form of geospatial data, but without further details, it cannot be definitively stated whether other formats like images, audio, video, or CSV files are included in the pipeline.
