Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available in the given context to determine the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text only mentions the use of Bayesian and non-Bayesian models, specifically Bayesian logistic regression, MLE logistic regression, Bayesian Generalized Additive Model (GAM), and Random Forest. However, no details about any deep learning models or their respective hyperparameters were mentioned.
