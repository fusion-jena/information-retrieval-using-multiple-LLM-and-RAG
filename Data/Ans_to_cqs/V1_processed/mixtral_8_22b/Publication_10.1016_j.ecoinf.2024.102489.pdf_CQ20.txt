The given context does not provide information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. It primarily focuses on the Random Forest (RF) model, its parameter optimization using GridSearchCV, and the use of high-quality LAI products from global LAI products as training samples for empirical models. However, it does not mention any details regarding the hardware resources employed for training the deep learning model.
