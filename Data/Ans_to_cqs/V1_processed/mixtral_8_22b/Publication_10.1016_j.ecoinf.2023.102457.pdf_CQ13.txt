Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific information about the hyperparameters used in the BirdNET deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the type of optimizer employed. It only mentions that the model was trained using extensive data pre-processing, augmentation, and mixup techniques. Additionally, it specifies that the model architecture is derived from the ResNet family and has 157 layers with more than 27 million parameters. To find out the exact hyperparameters used during the training process, one would need access to the source code or additional documentation related to the development of the BirdNET model.
