The text does not provide information about specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, scaling, etc., that were applied in the deep learning pipeline. The focus of the study is on implementing a deep neural network algorithm called IUC-NN to predict the conservation status of unevaluated orchid species using four groups of features derived from digital occurrence records. These include geographical, climatic, biome, and anthropogenic factors. The authors mention splitting their dataset into training and testing sets, performing cross-validation, and selecting the best model based on the lowest cross-entropy loss. However, they do not discuss any specific data augmentation techniques employed during this process.
