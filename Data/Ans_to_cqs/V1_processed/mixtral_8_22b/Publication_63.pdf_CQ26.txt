Based on the given context, it is not explicitly mentioned what specific techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, there are some indications of how the data was handled. For instance, a random sample of 10% of the dataset of each trait was extracted before model training, serving as an 'independent evaluation' or 'test dataset'. This could be seen as a form of stratification since the sampling was done based on traits. Additionally, the remaining data was split into 'training dataset' and 'validation dataset' by a ratio of 4:1. While these methods do not directly address data bias, they contribute to ensuring that the model generalizes well to unseen data. It should also be noted that the use of transfer learning, where pre-trained layer weights from a classification task on ImageNet were employed, can help mitigate issues related to limited data availability. Nevertheless, without further information, it cannot be confirmed if other techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection were utilized.
