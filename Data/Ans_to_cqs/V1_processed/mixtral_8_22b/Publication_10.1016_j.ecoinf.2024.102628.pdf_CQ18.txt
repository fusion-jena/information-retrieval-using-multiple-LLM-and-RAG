The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves adopting a broader and more conservative testing strategy. Specifically, one transect from each target class ("Plateau", "White-sand", and "Riparian") is excluded for testing in each iteration, accounting for approximately 17% of the data. Cross-validation is employed similarly to the classification problem. To evaluate the model's overall performance across all transects, a cumulative assessment is conducted by measuring the coefficient of determination (R^2) between true versus predicted values for all 648 multitemporal transect predictions. Additionally, the study employs a comparative evaluation of traditional LiDAR-derived metrics and 2D point cloud image-based machine learning approaches for forest type classification and regression analysis. Hyperparameters such as'mtry' and 'ntree' are fine-tuned using the caret package in R, while features are selected prior to training using the findCorrelation function. Furthermore, a majority voting strategy is utilized, employing the mode for classification and the median for regression. Each 5-m segment within a 450 m multitemporal transect is assigned a predicted class or a continuous value for regression. This allows for a side-by-side comparison to assess the relative performance, effectiveness, and accuracy of the proposed image-based machine learning method against traditional metric-based techniques.
