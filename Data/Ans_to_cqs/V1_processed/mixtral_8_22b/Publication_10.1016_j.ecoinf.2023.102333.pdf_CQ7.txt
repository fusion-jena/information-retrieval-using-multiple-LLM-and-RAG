In this study, the data was split into two parts: training and validation sets. The division was done randomly, with 80% of the data allocated for training and the remaining 20% for validation. To maintain independence between these datasets, a 15-meter buffer was applied around all sample points. This means that no point within the 15-meter radius of another point was included in both the training and validation sets. After splitting, the reference points were exported to the cloud for model training and validation.
