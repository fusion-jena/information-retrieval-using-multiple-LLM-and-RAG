The provided context does not explicitly mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it does discuss the importance of having a robust and efficient method for selecting suitable inputs when dealing with a large number of input variables, particularly when using Self-Adaptive Models (SAMs) that require evaluating the best options. This suggests that addressing data bias through appropriate preprocessing techniques would indeed be important in ensuring accurate results from these models.

In general, stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes within each set. Oversampling increases the size of the minority class by duplicating examples, while undersampling reduces the size of the majority class by removing examples. These techniques help balance datasets and reduce bias towards the majority class. Diverse data collection aims to gather data from various sources to ensure representation of all possible scenarios, reducing potential biases introduced by limited data sources.

While the provided context does not directly discuss these techniques, they remain relevant considerations for addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Further research may explore how these techniques could be integrated into the development of novel and efficient approaches for handling large numbers of input variables in self-adaptive models.
