Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to determine the exact process followed for deploying the trained deep learning model. However, based on common practices in machine learning projects, it can be assumed that after training the models (CNN-BiGRU, KELM, RVFL, CNN-BiRNN, etc.) using various architectures and hyperparameters, the best performing model would have been selected for deployment. This could involve processes such as model serialization or saving the model weights, choosing a suitable platform for hosting the model, and setting up APIs or other interfaces for making predictions using the deployed model. But without specific details about these aspects, we cannot provide a more precise answer.
