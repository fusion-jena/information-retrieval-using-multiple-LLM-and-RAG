The text does not provide explicit details on how the data was split for deep learning model training. However, based on common practices in machine learning, it can be inferred that the data was likely divided into two main sets: one for training the initial model (T0) and another for fine-tuning the risk threshold (T1). Additionally, there might have been a separate holdout set or cross-validation scheme employed during the training process to prevent overfitting and evaluate the performance of the model. Unfortunately, without more specific information, it cannot be determined exactly what percentage of the data was allocated to each subset or if any additional subsets were created.
