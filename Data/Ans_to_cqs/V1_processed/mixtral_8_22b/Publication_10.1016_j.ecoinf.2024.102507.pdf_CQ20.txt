The text does not provide information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. However, it mentions that during the testing phase, the use of Python's Rasterio module to disassemble multi-band images into single-band images helped reduce the hardware resources required for deep learning. This suggests that the authors might have been concerned about resource limitations while working with high-dimensional data. Nonetheless, without explicit mention of the hardware resources used, one cannot definitively state whether GPUs, TPUs, or other types of hardware were employed for training the deep learning models.
