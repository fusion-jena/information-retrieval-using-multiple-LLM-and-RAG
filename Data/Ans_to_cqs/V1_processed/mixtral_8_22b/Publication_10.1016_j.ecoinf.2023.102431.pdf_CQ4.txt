The given context does not provide any specific details about the application of data augmentation techniques in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer based solely on the provided text. However, some common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, zooming, and shearing. These techniques help improve model performance and prevent overfitting by artificially expanding the training dataset with modified versions of existing images.
