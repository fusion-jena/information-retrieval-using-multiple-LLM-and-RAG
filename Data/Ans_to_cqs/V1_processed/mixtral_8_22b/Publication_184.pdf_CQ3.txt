In the given context, the data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline is bounding box annotation. This technique involves providing not only the class of the object but also the bounding box data of the object as the correct answer. The bounding box data includes the x, y coordinates, width, and height of the object in the image's dataset. In this case, the object being annotated is a fish.

Bounding box annotation is a common technique used in object detection tasks where the goal is to identify the presence and location of objects within an image. It is often used in conjunction with other annotation techniques such as semantic segmentation or instance segmentation, depending on the specific requirements of the task.

Semantic segmentation involves labeling every pixel in an image with its corresponding class label, while instance segmentation involves identifying individual instances of objects within an image and assigning them unique labels. These techniques can be more time-consuming and require more expertise than bounding box annotation, but they can provide more detailed and accurate results.

In summary, the data annotation technique used in the given context is bounding box annotation, which involves providing the class of the object along with its bounding box data as the correct answer. Other annotation techniques such as semantic segmentation and instance segmentation may also be used depending on the specific requirements of the task.
