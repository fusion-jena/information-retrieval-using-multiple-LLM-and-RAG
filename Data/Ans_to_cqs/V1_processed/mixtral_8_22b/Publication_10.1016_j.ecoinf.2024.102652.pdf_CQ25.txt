The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is semantic segmentation, which involves assigning a category label to each pixel of an image. Specifically, the MU-NET deep learning method is employed to construct soil salinity maps by applying semantic segmentation to the input image. This allows for the automatic detection and segmentation of soil salinity and vegetation without requiring continuous field EC measurements. The U-NET method, upon which MU-NET is based, has previously demonstrated success in various remote sensing image classification tasks and medical image recognition and segmentation.
