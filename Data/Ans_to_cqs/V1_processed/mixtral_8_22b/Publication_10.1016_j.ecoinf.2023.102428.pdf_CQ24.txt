The given context does not provide information about specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some common strategies used in machine learning and deep learning include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using ensemble methods to reduce variance caused by random initialization, and applying regularization techniques like dropout to prevent overfitting due to randomness.
