The text does not explicitly state the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it can be inferred that the model uses a form of cross-validation, specifically a validation set, to train and optimize Learning Rate (LR) models using a grid search tool implemented in scikit-learn. Additionally, the application of the Selection with Guaranteed Risk (SGR) algorithm on the validation set suggests that the performance on this set is used to evaluate the model's readiness for deployment. Therefore, it can be assumed that the completion of training might be determined based on the performance of the model on the validation set, such as reaching a desired level of accuracy or minimizing the validation loss.
