The paper does not explicitly mention which specific cloud computing platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the model was deployed in a cloud computing environment. This could potentially refer to any major cloud service provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. Without further information from the authors, we cannot determine the exact platform used.
