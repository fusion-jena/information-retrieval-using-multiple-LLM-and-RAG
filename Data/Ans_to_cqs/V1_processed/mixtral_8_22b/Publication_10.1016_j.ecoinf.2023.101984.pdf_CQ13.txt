Unfortunately, there is no information available about the specific hyperparameters used for the deep learning model such as learning rate or optimizer. However, it can be seen from the given context that the maximum number of iterations was used with the subsample run type and a 30 random test percentage. Additionally, the output of the MaxEnt model was analyzed, and the results were presented as averages of 10 replicate runs.
