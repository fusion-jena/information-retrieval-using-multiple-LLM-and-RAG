The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in this context is primarily for classification tasks. Six pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) - VGG16, ResNet50, ResNet101, Inception-v3, DenseNet201, and EfficientNetB0 - were selected due to their proven effectiveness in transfer learning and high performance on similar classification tasks. These models were trained using the Adam optimizer algorithm, a batch size of 10, and 100 epochs. The learning rates were determined through empirical trials. The goal of these models was to accurately classify images based on whether they contained Cortaderia selloana or not. Additionally, one of the models, DenseNet201, was also used in object detection mode with Faster R-CNN ResNet50, pre-trained on the MS COCO dataset. However, the main focus of the study appears to be on image classification rather than object detection or other tasks such as segmentation.
