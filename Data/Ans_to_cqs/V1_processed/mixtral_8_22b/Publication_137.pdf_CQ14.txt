Based on the given information, it appears that the optimization of hyperparameters was done through experimentation rather than using specific methods like grid search or random search. In Table 1, the authors fixed the voxel size and batch size while adjusting the regularization strength to find the best value. However, there isn't any explicit mention of using grid search or random search techniques for hyperparameter tuning. Therefore, it seems that the authors employed manual trial-and-error experiments to determine the optimal hyperparameters for their model.
