Based on the given information, there isn't any explicit mention of the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. However, it is mentioned that a sensitivity experiment was conducted on the BEiT (12 M) model, investigating its performance under various experimental setups. These setups allowed modifications to crucial parameters like learning rate, batch size, regularization intensity, and training epochs. Unfortunately, the specific values for these hyperparameters were not disclosed in the provided context.
