Based on the given context, it appears that the deployment process of the trained deep learning model is not explicitly mentioned. However, some related details about the model training and application can be found.

In this study, a deep learning model was trained using satellite images for land cover classification. The target PSI, having the same format as the trained PSI, can be classified using the trained model. It is also noted that if satellite imagery continues to accumulate due to ongoing satellite observations, PSIs can be continually generated, allowing for continuous classification using the model. This facilitates PCF land monitoring.

Moreover, the text mentions that the U-Net model, a type of CNN, was employed for classification tasks. The model was trained using both training and validation data, emphasizing the importance of labeled data for its application. To create training data for the PCF, grid cells with a resolution of 2560m were established in South Korea, considering the training unit of the U-Net model being 256 pixels. Subsequently, the PSI was extracted from the selected cells to prepare input data for model training.

However, the exact process of how the trained deep learning model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection, remains unclear within the provided context. Further information would be required to provide a more detailed response regarding the deployment process.
