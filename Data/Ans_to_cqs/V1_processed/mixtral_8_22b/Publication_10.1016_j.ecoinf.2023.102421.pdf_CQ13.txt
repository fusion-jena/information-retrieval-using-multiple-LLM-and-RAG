Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. However, it discusses the use of hyperparameter optimization for machine learning models, specifically XGBoost and LightGBM, where the hyperparameters were tuned using several optimizers. It also mentions that RMSE was used as the objective (loss) function. Unfortunately, without more detailed information about the specific hyperparameters used, I cannot provide a comprehensive list.
