Unfortunately, there isn't any specific mention of data annotation techniques used in the given context. However, I can provide some general insights about common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines.

Data annotation is the process of labeling raw data such as text, images, or videos so that machine learning models can understand them better. Some popular data annotation techniques include:

1. Image classification: Labeling entire images based on their content. For example, classifying whether an image contains a cat or a dog.

2. Object detection/bounding boxes: Drawing rectangular boxes around objects in an image and assigning labels to those objects. This technique helps localize and identify different objects within an image.

3. Semantic segmentation: Assigning pixel-level labels to every object in an image. This technique provides detailed information about the shape and location of objects in an image.

4. Instance segmentation: Similar to semantic segmentation but also distinguishes between individual instances of the same object class. This technique is useful when dealing with overlapping objects or objects of the same class appearing together.

5. Polygon annotation: Outlining objects in an image using polygons instead of rectangles. This technique offers more precise boundaries for irregularly shaped objects.

6. Key point annotation: Marking specific points on an object in an image. This technique is often used for facial recognition tasks, where key points like eyes, nose, and mouth need to be identified.

7. Text annotation: Annotating text documents for tasks like named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, sentiment analysis, etc.

8. Audio annotation: Transcribing audio files or adding tags to indicate emotions, speaker changes, background noise, etc.

9. Video annotation: Frame-by-frame labeling of video sequences for tasks like action recognition, object tracking, etc.
