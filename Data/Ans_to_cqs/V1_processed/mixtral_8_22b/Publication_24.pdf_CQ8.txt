The information provided does not explicitly state where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, based on common practices in academic publications, it can be assumed that the authors would have made their code publicly accessible alongside their publication. Therefore, a good starting point would be to check popular code repositories such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket for any repositories associated with the authors' names or the title of the paper. In this case, searching for "CityNet" or "Fairbrass AJ" might yield results. It is also possible that the authors included a link to their code repository within the original article itself, which could be found through the DOI provided. Unfortunately, without more specific information, it cannot be definitively stated where the code repository is located.
