The given context does not provide information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions two datasets named 'CS' and 'NW'. It appears these datasets were used for analysis and modeling purposes, but their exact nature or source is not specified. Therefore, I cannot provide details about the type of datasets they are, such as whether they are similar to MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
