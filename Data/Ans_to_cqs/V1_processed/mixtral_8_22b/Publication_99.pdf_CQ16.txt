The text does not explicitly state the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it can be inferred that the training process continues until a certain number of epochs are reached. For instance, the classification networks are trained for 20 epochs. Additionally, the use of early stopping or monitoring validation metrics like validation loss could also be employed to decide when to stop training, but these are not mentioned explicitly in the given context.
