The text does not provide explicit information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, based on the methodological workflow diagram (Fig. 3), we can see that the deep learning part was implemented using the Python library PyTorch. This suggests that the code might be written in Python and could potentially be found in a public repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. To find out if the code is publicly available, one would need to search for repositories related to the authors or the project name mentioned in the paper.
