Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available in the given context to provide a detailed explanation about how the trained deep learning model was deployed. However, based on common practices in deep learning projects, after training the model, it would typically be saved or serialized so that it can be loaded later without having to retrain it again. This could involve saving the weights of the model or even the entire model structure itself. As for platform selection, this depends on the specific requirements of the project. It might be deployed on a cloud service like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure, or it could be integrated into a local application or system. Without more details, it's not possible to give a definitive answer regarding the deployment process of the trained deep learning model.
