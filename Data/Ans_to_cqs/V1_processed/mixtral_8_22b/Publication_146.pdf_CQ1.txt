The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the statement "due to the lack of existing quality data, we set out to create our own dataset for the purpose of the project" that the authors collected their own data rather than relying on publicly available datasets. This suggests that they may have used custom methods for gathering data, which could include techniques like surveys, sensors, or manual labeling. Unfortunately, without more information about the nature of the project or the type of data involved, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer regarding the exact methods used for data collection.
