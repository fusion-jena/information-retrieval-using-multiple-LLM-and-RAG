Unfortunately, there is no mention of any specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model within the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information based on the available text. Please provide more details or additional context if possible.

Based on the provided context, it appears that the authors have focused on testing various machine learning algorithms for their predictive models rather than employing deep learning techniques. They mentioned using several machine learning algorithms such as Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), Random Forest (RF), Flexible Discriminant Analysis (FDA), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Generalized Boosting regression Model (GBM), and Maximum-Entropy learning (MAXENT). However, none of these explicitly refer to deep learning models, nor do they discuss any hyperparameters related to them.
