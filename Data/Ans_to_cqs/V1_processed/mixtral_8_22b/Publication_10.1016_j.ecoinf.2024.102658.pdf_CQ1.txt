Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention the specific methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the data used includes environmental variables such as climate data and physiological data. These types of data can often be collected using various methods such as remote sensing technologies, ground-based weather stations, or publicly available datasets like WorldClim. Additionally, physiological data may be obtained through field observations, laboratory experiments, or other relevant sources. It is also noted that the collection of these data can be challenging and expensive, which could imply the need for multiple data collection methods.
