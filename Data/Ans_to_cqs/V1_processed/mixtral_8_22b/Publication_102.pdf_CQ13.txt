In the given context, the deep learning model referred to as Model-2 uses the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001. The model was trained using an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 GPU with a batch size of 8. Early stopping was applied to prevent overfitting based on the model's performance on the validation set. Additionally, Model-2 was initialized with pre-trained weights based on the ImageNet dataset.
