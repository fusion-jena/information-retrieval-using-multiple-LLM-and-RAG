Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention any specific criteria used to determine when training is completed for the PTDLEN-VAE model or any other mentioned techniques. Therefore, without additional information, we cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, common practices in machine learning include monitoring metrics like validation loss, accuracy, or other relevant measures during training. Training may be considered complete when these metrics reach a satisfactory level or stop improving significantly, indicating convergence or overfitting.

In this case, since the context discusses various performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and F2-score, one might infer that similar metrics could also be monitored during training to decide when to stop training. Nonetheless, without explicit information about the stopping criterion used for the PTDLEN-VAE model, we cannot confirm this assumption.
