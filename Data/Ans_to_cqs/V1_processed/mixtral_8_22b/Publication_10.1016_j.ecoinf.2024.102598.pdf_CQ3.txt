Unfortunately, there is no specific mention of any data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline within the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based solely on the provided text. However, generally speaking, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and labeling. These methods are often applied to images, videos, or other forms of visual data to create labeled datasets for training machine learning models.
