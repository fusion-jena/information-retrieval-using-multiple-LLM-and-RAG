The text does not provide specific details about the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it mentions that machine learning methods, including those used for classification, have great potential when combined with high-quality imagery and large training datasets. It suggests that incorporating human pattern recognition abilities with machine learning methods, such as "human in the loop" classification, could improve the accuracy and efficiency of image classification tasks. Additionally, the authors mention the possibility of using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to aid in classification. Unfortunately, without further context or additional information, it is impossible to determine which specific deep learning models were employed in this study.
