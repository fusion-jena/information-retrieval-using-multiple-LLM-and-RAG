The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific dataset used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions two papers related to deep learning models - one for image recognition and another for avian diversity monitoring using BirdNET. It can be inferred that these models might have been trained or tested on relevant datasets, but without explicit information about those datasets, it cannot be determined what they are. Therefore, based on the given context, the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline remain unknown.
