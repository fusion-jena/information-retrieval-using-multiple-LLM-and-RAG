Based on the given information, it appears that the authors have not explicitly mentioned the specific datasets used for training or evaluating their deep learning models such as VGG, Inception, and ResNet. However, they do mention that they constructed a dataset for this purpose. Therefore, without additional context, I cannot provide the exact names of the datasets used in their deep learning pipeline.
