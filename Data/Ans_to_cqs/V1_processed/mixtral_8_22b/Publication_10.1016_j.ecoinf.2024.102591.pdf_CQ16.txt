The given context does not explicitly mention any specific criteria used to determine when training is completed in the context of the FIREMAP system. However, it mentions that the system uses machine learning techniques such as Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for burned area mapping and fire severity assessment. In general, common criteria used to determine when training is complete in machine learning include reaching a certain number of epochs, achieving a desired level of accuracy, or observing a plateau in the validation loss. Without further information, we cannot definitively state which criteria are used specifically for the FIREMAP system.
