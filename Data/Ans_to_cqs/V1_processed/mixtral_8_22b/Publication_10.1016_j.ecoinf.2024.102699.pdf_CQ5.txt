The text does not explicitly mention any specific dataset names like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it mentions using log-mel spectrograms as inputs to the models, suggesting that the dataset might contain audio files. Additionally, there is a reference to integrating noise samples and non-bird audio elements from the bird audio detection data set from the DCASE challenge. Therefore, while the exact dataset names are not mentioned, it appears that the study uses some form of audio dataset containing bird sounds and potentially other types of noises.
