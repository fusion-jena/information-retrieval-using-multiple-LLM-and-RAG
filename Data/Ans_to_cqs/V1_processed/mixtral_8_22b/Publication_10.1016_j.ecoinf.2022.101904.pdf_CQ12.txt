The pipeline uses several types of deep learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), and Swin Transformer. Specifically, the paper mentions a combination of GAN + ST (Swin Transformer) and a 3DUNetGSFormer model, which also utilizes Swin Transformer. Additionally, the paper compares these models against other popular architectures like ViT (Vision Transformer) and CoAtNet. Therefore, it can be concluded that the pipeline primarily employs Transformer-based models, along with some use of CNNs and GANs.
