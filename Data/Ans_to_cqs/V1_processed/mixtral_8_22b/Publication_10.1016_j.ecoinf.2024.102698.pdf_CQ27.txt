Unfortunately, there isn't any information available regarding the deployment process of the trained deep learning models mentioned in the given text. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this specific query.

However, generally speaking, after training a deep learning model, it needs to be saved or serialized so that it can be deployed for use in various platforms such as web services, mobile devices, etc. The process often involves saving the model architecture along with its weights and biases. Once the model is saved, it can be loaded onto different platforms where it can be utilized for making predictions or generating new data. The choice of platform depends on factors like computational resources, accessibility, user requirements, etc.
