Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about specific preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, some general preprocessing steps can be inferred from the context. Before training a deep learning model, the dataset is typically divided into a training set and a test set. In this case, the dataset was divided in a ratio of 75:25 into a training set of 5789 images and a test set of 1930 images. Additionally, when applying transfer learning, the base models were frozen, loaded with weights trained on the ImageNet dataset, and used as a feature extractor. A dropout layer was also added with a dropout rate of 0.2 to reduce overfitting of the model. While these aren't traditional preprocessing steps, they do involve preparing the data and the model for training. It should be noted that depending on the nature of the dataset and the requirements of the deep learning model, additional preprocessing steps may be required.
