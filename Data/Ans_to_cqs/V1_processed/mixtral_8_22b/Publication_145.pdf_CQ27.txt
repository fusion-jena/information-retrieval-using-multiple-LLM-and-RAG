Based on the given information, it is not explicitly stated how the trained deep learning model was deployed. However, we can infer some details about the development environment and hardware used during the training phase.

The model was developed using the programming language R with the RStudio interface to Keras and TensorFlow backend. This suggests that the deployment might involve utilizing these libraries and frameworks to load the serialized model and perform predictions.

Additionally, the training was performed using an NVIDIA RTX2080 graphics card with 8GB of dedicated memory. This indicates that the deployment may also require a compatible GPU to ensure efficient prediction times.

Unfortunately, without specific information regarding the deployment process, such as whether the model was saved and loaded using a particular format (like.h5 or.pb), or if any cloud platform or custom application was utilized for serving predictions, I cannot provide a more detailed response.
