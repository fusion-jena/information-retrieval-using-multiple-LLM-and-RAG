Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this query based solely on the information available. However, common methods for optimizing hyperparameters include techniques such as grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, or gradient-based optimization. Without additional details about the specific implementation of the artificial neural network mentioned in the text, we cannot determine which method was used for hyperparameter optimization.
