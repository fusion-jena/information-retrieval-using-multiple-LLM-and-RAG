The article does not provide information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or managing random seed values. However, some common strategies used to manage randomness include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using ensembles of models trained with different initializations, and employing techniques such as dropout or batch normalization to reduce overfitting caused by randomness.
