Based on the given context, it is not explicitly mentioned which specific datasets were used in the deep learning pipeline. However, there are some clues about the type of data used. For instance, the study mentions the use of hyperspectral imagery and satellite imagery for water quality assessment. Additionally, the study refers to the collection of thirty-two water samples during an aerial imaging campaign, which suggests that the researchers may have used their own custom dataset for training and testing the machine learning models. Therefore, without further information, it cannot be determined if standard datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet were used in this particular study.
