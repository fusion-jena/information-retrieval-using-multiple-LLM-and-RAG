After conducting initial computational experiments with different combinations of epochs of 300, 400, and 500 with batch sizes of 8, 16, and 32, it was determined that the optimal hyperparameters for their training were 400 epochs with a batch size of 8. These hyperparameters were kept constant when comparing the five detection models using 640 x 640 and 1280 x 1280 pixels input resolutions on each model type. Although not explicitly mentioned, it appears that the authors may have employed a form of manual grid search or trial-and-error approach to determine the optimal hyperparameters for their model. In a grid search, one would systematically test various combinations of hyperparameter values and select the combination that yields the best performance. Similarly, in a trial-and-error approach, one might iteratively adjust hyperparameters based on observed results until satisfactory performance is achieved.
