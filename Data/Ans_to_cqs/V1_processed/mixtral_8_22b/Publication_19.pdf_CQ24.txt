The table provided does not contain any specific details about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or setting a random seed value. However, it is common practice in deep learning to use a fixed random seed for reproducibility purposes. By setting a fixed random seed, one can ensure that the same results are obtained when training the model multiple times. Additionally, some popular libraries such as Tensorflow and PyTorch provide built-in functions to set a global random seed. It should also be noted that while fixing the random seed ensures reproducibility, it might limit the exploration of different solutions during optimization. Therefore, it is important to strike a balance between reproducibility and exploring various solutions.
