The query asks about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as splitting it into train, test, and validation sets. However, none of the given context explicitly mentions these specific criteria or methods for splitting the data. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer based solely on the information available.

In general, when working with machine learning models like deep learning networks, data is often divided into three main subsets: training set, validation set, and testing set. The training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set helps tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting during the training process. Lastly, the testing set evaluates the final performance of the trained model. Common practices include random sampling or stratified sampling techniques to maintain similar distributions across all subsets.
