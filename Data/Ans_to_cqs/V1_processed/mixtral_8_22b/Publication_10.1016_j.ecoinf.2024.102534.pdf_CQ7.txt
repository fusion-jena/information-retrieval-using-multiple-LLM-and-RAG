The given context does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it is mentioned that 80% of the data for each category (epiphyte lowland orchid, terrestrial lowland orchid, epiphyte upland orchid, and terrestrial upland orchid) were used to build the model, while the remaining 20% of the data were used for testing. This suggests a common practice of splitting the dataset into 80% for training and 20% for testing. It should be noted that this is only one possible way to split the data, and other methods such as cross-validation can also be employed depending on the requirements of the project.
