The text mentions two main methods of data annotation used in the deep learning pipeline: bounding box annotation and semantic image segmentation.

Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangles around objects within an image to identify their locations. This technique is commonly used for tasks like object detection and localization.

Semantic image segmentation, on the other hand, involves assigning each pixel in an image to a particular class or category. This method is more detailed than bounding box annotation and is often used for tasks like scene understanding and autonomous driving.

To reduce the time and cost associated with these manual annotation processes, the authors mention two strategies: semi-supervised learning and active learning. In semi-supervised learning, only a portion of the data needs to be labeled, while active learning enables the model to selectively request labels for specific data points.

Additionally, the IoU (Intersection over Union) formula is mentioned, which is a common metric used to evaluate the performance of object detection and segmentation algorithms. It measures the overlap between the predicted and ground truth bounding boxes or segments.
