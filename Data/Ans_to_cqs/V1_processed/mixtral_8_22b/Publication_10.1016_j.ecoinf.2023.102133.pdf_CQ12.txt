Based on the given information, it appears that the authors have utilized two types of machine learning models - Random Forest (RF) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). However, neither of these models falls under the category of deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. Therefore, based on the provided context, there is no indication of any specific deep learning model being used in the pipeline.
