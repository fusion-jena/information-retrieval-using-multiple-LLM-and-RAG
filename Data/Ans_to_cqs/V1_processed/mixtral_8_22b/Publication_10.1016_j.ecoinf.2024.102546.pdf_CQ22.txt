The paper primarily focuses on using weed detection accuracies to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models YOLOX and YOLOv8. These accuracies are measured both when the models are trained and tested on data from the same season (in-season) and when they are trained and tested on data from different seasons (cross-season). The authors also use the standard error over three modeling replications to provide an indication of variability in their results. However, it should be noted that the paper does not explicitly mention the use of other common classification metrics such as precision, recall, or F1 score.
