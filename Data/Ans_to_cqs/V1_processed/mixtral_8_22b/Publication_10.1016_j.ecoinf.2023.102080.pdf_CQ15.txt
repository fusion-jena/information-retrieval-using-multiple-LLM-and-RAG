Based on the given information, it appears there is no mention of any deep learning pipelines or optimization techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). Instead, the text discusses a two-step "embedded" covariate selection procedure designed to improve predictive abilities and parsimony of species distribution models within a high-dimensional candidate covariate space. This process involves combining a collinearity-filtering algorithm (Step A) with three model-specific embedded regularization techniques (Step B): Generalized Linear Model with Elastic Net Regularization, Generalized Additive Model with Null-Space Penalization, and Guided Regularized Random Forest. Therefore, I cannot provide information regarding optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline since this topic isn't covered in the provided context.
