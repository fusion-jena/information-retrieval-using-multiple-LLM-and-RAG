According to the provided context, the whole dataset was split into training and testing sets of various ratios, including 70:30, 80:20, and 90:10, for strong performance analysis. This means that the dataset was divided into training and testing subsets based on these ratios. For example, if the 70:30 ratio was used, then 70% of the dataset would be allocated for training the model, while the remaining 30% would be used for testing its performance. Similarly, for the 80:20 ratio, 80% of the dataset would be used for training, and 20% for testing. Finally, for the 90:10 ratio, 90% of the dataset would be used for training, and only 10% for testing. These ratios were likely chosen to evaluate how well the model could learn from varying amounts of training data and to assess its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.
