The bird song dataset was split into three parts: training, validation, and testing datasets. To achieve this, for each species and country, 70% of the downloaded recordings were randomly selected for the training dataset, while the remaining 30% were reserved for testing. Data augmentation was then applied exclusively to the training dataset, and the resulting segments were randomly allocated between the training and validation sets using a ratio of 0.8/0.2. Each model was subsequently trained for 40 epochs with a batch size of 8 segments and a learning rate of 0.001 utilizing the Adam optimizer. The training procedure was repeated ten times to accommodate the impact of random weight initialization in neural networks. During each iteration, the model was implemented on the testing dataset, and the confusion matrix, along with the count of True Positives (TP), False Positives (FP), True Negatives (TN), and False Negatives (FN), were documented.
