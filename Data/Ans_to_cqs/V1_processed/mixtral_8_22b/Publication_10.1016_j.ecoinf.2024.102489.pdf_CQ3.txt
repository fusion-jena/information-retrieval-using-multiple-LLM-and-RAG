Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to provide a detailed answer about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, some common data annotation techniques include bounding box annotation, where objects within images are outlined with rectangles; semantic segmentation, which involves labeling each pixel in an image with its corresponding object or region category; and instance segmentation, which combines both object detection and semantic segmentation to identify individual instances of objects within an image. These techniques can be applied to various types of data, including high spatial resolution satellite image data mentioned in the context.
