The text does not provide explicit information about the purpose of the deep learning model being used. However, we can infer from the context that the model might be used for classification or regression tasks related to ecology or environmental studies. This is because the text mentions using features like spectral bands, vegetation indices, and other variables commonly associated with remote sensing data in ecological research. Additionally, the use of machine learning algorithms such as XGBoost suggests that the goal could be to classify or predict certain outcomes based on these features. Without further details, though, it is difficult to determine the exact purpose of the deep learning model.
