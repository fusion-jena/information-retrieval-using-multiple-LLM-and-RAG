The deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context primarily uses satellite imagery data format. The authors discuss leveraging deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) classification. CNNs are highly effective for image recognition tasks, making them suitable for analyzing satellite imagery. The cited studies also focus on using high-resolution remote sensing images and spectral features from satellite data for LULC classification. Therefore, the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is image data.
