The given context does not provide any direct or indirect information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. It primarily discusses the use of a TPINet-based process network approach to identify causal links between variables in a pine-dominated ecosystem, considering a maximum memory duration of the variables up to 6 hours to focus on sub-daily scale processes. The context also mentions the computation of contributions of 6-hour variability to within-week variability and the results being shown in Figure 3. However, it does not mention anything related to monitoring the model performance during training.
