In the given context, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network). It is a popular object detection algorithm that uses a two-stage process involving region proposal followed by classification and regression. In this case, two different versions of Faster R-CNN were created for the benchmark - Faster R-CNN (640) and Faster R-CNN (1280), both using Resnet50 as a backbone. These models fall under the category of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) due to their architecture and functionality.
