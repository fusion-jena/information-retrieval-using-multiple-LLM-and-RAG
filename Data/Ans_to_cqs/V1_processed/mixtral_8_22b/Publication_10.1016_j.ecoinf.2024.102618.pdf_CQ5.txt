The text does not provide explicit information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that EfficientNetB0 is trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database. Additionally, ResNet50v2 is mentioned to be trained on a million images from the ImageNet dataset. Therefore, one can infer that the ImageNet dataset has been utilized in the deep learning pipeline. Furthermore, the text discusses a dataset called PlanVillage, but it doesn't explicitly state whether it is used for training or testing purposes. It only mentions that an augmented version of PlanVillage is proposed for use by different researchers for comparison.
