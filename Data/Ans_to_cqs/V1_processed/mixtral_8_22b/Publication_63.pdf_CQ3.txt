Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that some form of labeling or annotation must have been applied to the datasets used in the study, considering they employed various machine learning models like CNNs, Xception51, and MobileNetV2.

Moreover, the text mentions the use of transfer learning, where pre-trained layer weights from a classification task on ImageNet were utilized for all CNN models. This implies that the original ImageNet dataset had undergone some sort of annotation process beforehand. Additionally, the study employs a weakly supervised learning approach combining data from the iNaturalist database and the TRY database, suggesting that these databases contain labeled information about plant photographs and trait measurements respectively.

However, without further details regarding the exact nature of the labels or annotations used in the mentioned databases, it is not possible to provide a definitive list of data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
