According to the given context, the hyperparameter α was optimised by training several models on the insect TL (TLm) benchmark dataset with α ∈ [1.0⋅10^(-6), 1.0]. It is mentioned that this range of values for α achieved high accuracy, as shown in Figure B.4. However, since there were only marginal changes in accuracy observed for all levels, the value of α = 0.5 was chosen for the study. Unfortunately, the context does not provide specific information about the method used for optimizing the hyperparameters, such as whether they used grid search or random search. Therefore, based on the available context, it can be said that the hyperparameter α was optimised by training multiple models with varying values of α within a certain range, but the exact optimization method remains unknown.
