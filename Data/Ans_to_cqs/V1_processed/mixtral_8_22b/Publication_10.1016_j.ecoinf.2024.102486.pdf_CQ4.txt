The given context does not provide specific information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotation, or scaling. However, it mentions that data augmentation methods can be effective but may suffer from slow convergence times due to the increased dimensionality of the explored space. The paper by Nanni, L., Maguolo, G., & Paci, M. (2020) discusses data augmentation approaches for improving analysis on many-core CPUs and GPUs, which could potentially include various techniques like those mentioned in the query. Additionally, the context refers to other tools and libraries commonly used in deep learning pipelines, including the Deep Learning Toolbox by MathWorks and cuDNN, both of which might support data augmentation techniques.
