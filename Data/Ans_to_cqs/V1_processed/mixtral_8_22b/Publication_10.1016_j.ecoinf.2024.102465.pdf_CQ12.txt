In this study, two types of deep learning models are employed: HRNet and LSTM-CNN. HRNet is primarily used for semantic segmentation tasks, such as deriving indices like greenness, blueness, and sky openness from social media image data. On the other hand, the LSTM-CNN model is applied for sentiment analysis tasks, specifically for calculating the sentiment index from NLP text data. Both models leverage their respective strengths to contribute to the overall research objectives.
