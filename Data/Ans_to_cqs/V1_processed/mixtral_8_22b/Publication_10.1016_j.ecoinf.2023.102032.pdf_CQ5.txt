The article does not provide explicit information about the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline for cloud detection with machine learning. However, it mentions several datasets related to Earth observation and remote sensing data. These include:

1. Sentinel-2 Level 2A: This dataset provides atmospherically corrected images from the European Space Agency's Sentinel-2 satellite mission. It has spatial resolutions ranging from 10m to 20m and was acquired between July 2019 and June 2021.

2. S2cloudless Cloud Probability: This dataset offers cloud probability estimates derived from Sentinel-2 imagery, also with a spatial resolution of 10m.

3. Sentinel-1 Ground Range Detected (GRD): This dataset consists of radar imagery obtained by the Sentinel-1 satellite mission, specifically using the Interferometric Wide Swath (IW) mode in ascending orbit.

4. Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+): This dataset contains multispectral imagery from the Landsat 7 satellite mission, with varying spatial resolutions depending on the band (from 5x20m to 30m). Data were collected between July 2012 and June 2014.

5. Landsat 8 Observation Land Images (OLI) Surface Reflectance (SR): Similar to the previous dataset, this one includes multispectral imagery from the Landsat 8 satellite mission, with a consistent spatial resolution of 30m across bands. Data were collected between July 2019 and June 2021.

6. PlanetScope Biannual Surface Reflectance Mosaics: This dataset comprises multispectral imagery from the PlanetScope constellation of satellites, with a high spatial resolution of approximately 4.77m. Data were collected twice yearly between July 2019 and June 2021.

While these datasets may have been utilized in the development or evaluation of the deep learning pipeline for cloud detection, there is no direct mention of their application within such a framework. Therefore, it cannot be definitively stated which specific datasets were employed in the deep learning pipeline itself.
