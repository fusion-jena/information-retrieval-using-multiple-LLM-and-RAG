The purpose of the deep learning model proposed in this study is primarily for single seed classification and retrieval. The model, named SeedNet, is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and consists of six learnable layers, five of which are convolutional, and the last one is fully connected. The ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function is applied to the output of each convolutional layer. To manage the number of parameters and computations within the network, thereby controlling overfitting, max pooling layers are inserted between consecutive convolutional layers. The input image size is set at 224 x 224 x 3. Depending on the selected dataset, the final fully connected layer outputs to an N-way softmax, generating a probability distribution across the N class labels to forecast, specifically 6 for the Canadian and 23 for the local datasets. This model has been demonstrated to achieve comparable accuracy to more intricate and deeper networks while requiring significantly shorter training times.
