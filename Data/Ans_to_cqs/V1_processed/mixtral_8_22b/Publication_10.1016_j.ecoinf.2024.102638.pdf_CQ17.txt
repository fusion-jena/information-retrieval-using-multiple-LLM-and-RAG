In the given context, although the focus is primarily on various machine learning models such as KNN, GP, TREE, RF, XGB, SVR, MLP, and their respective parameters, there isn't explicit mention of regularization methods used specifically in deep learning pipelines like dropout or L2 regularization. However, we can infer from some parameter names mentioned that certain forms of regularization might be employed.

For instance, 'alpha', often associated with Ridge Regression, is a form of L2 regularization where the penalty term is proportional to the sum of squares of all feature weights. Similarly, 'l1_ratio' suggests the use of Lasso Regularization, which uses absolute values instead of squared values in its penalty term. Both these methods help prevent overfitting by adding constraints to the optimization problem during model training.

Moreover,'max_depth','min_samples_split','min_samples_leaf', and'max_features' are parameters related to decision tree-based models (like TREE, RF, XGB), which control the complexity of the learned trees, thereby acting as a form of regularization against overfitting.

However, it should be noted that these aren't exactly equivalent to dropout or L2 regularization used explicitly in deep learning architectures. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent overfitting by making the network more robust to small changes in input features. On the other hand, L2 regularization adds a penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of coefficients to the loss function, discouraging large weight values and thus reducing overfitting.

Therefore, based on the provided context, while we see evidence of regularization being applied through various means, direct application of dropout or L2 regularization as typically seen in deep learning pipelines isn't explicitly discussed.
