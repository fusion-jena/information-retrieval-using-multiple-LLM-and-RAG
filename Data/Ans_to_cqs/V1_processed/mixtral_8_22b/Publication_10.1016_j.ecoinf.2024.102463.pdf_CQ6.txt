Before training a deep learning model, various preprocessing steps can be taken to ensure optimal performance. One common step mentioned in the provided context is data standardization. Standardizing the data involves transforming it so that it has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. This helps to improve the convergence speed of the model by making the input features have similar scales. Additionally, the context mentions that the standardization parameters are calculated based on a training dataset and then applied to the test datasets. Other potential preprocessing steps not explicitly mentioned in the provided context could include handling missing values, removing outliers, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling. However, these specific steps may vary depending on the nature of the dataset and the requirements of the particular deep learning task.
