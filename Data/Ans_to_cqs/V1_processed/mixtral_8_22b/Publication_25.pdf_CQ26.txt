Based on the provided context, it appears that there isn't specific information about techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, the text does mention some strategies to overcome the issue of limited training data in deep learning applications, particularly in the field of remote sensing.

One strategy mentioned is combining labeled data in a semi-supervised framework, which allows neural networks to learn generalized features on a larger set of training examples before being fine-tuned on a smaller number of high-quality annotations. Another technique discussed is self-supervised learning, where unsupervised methods are employed to generate training data that can then be utilized to train supervised models. This method was specifically applied to remote sensing for hyperspectral image classification.

While these strategies do not directly address data bias, they aim to enhance the performance of deep learning algorithms when dealing with limited or scarce training data. To tackle data bias explicitly, one could consider employing various sampling techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or stratified splitting to ensure balanced representation across different classes within the dataset. Additionally, collecting diverse data can also help mitigate potential biases in the dataset.
