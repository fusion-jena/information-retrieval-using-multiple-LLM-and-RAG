The given context does not provide information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it discusses the use of feature extraction enhancement and pose handling methods to improve the performance of deep learning models for face recognition tasks.

According to the context, A. Levy et al. conducted initial experiments comparing different architectures, loss functions, and preprocessing methods for face recognition tasks. They found that using feature extraction enhancement (FEE) resulted in significantly better results compared to using data augmentation techniques. Additionally, they explored pose handling methods, including one-to-many (OM) and many-to-one (MO) approaches, to handle variations in facial poses. These methods generated multiple patches or images of pose variability from a single image or recovered the canonical view of face images from non-frontal views, respectively.

While the context does not explicitly mention techniques for addressing data bias, it suggests that careful consideration of preprocessing methods can lead to improved model performance. In particular, the authors emphasize the importance of pose handling for individual BR ray recognition, indicating that this challenge is shared between face recognition and BR ray recognition tasks. Therefore, it may be beneficial to explore similar preprocessing strategies for addressing data biases in other deep learning applications.
