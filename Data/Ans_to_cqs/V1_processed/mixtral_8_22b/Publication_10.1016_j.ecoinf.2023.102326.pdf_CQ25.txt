The text does not provide explicit information about the purpose of a specific deep learning model. However, based on the given context, one can infer that the main goal might involve analyzing large datasets of urban acoustic environments using machine learning approaches such as sound event classification. These techniques aim to process and classify sounds present in the environment, potentially contributing to understanding and characterizing urban soundscapes better. Nevertheless, the exact nature of the deep learning model (classification, segmentation, or detection) remains undisclosed in the provided context.
