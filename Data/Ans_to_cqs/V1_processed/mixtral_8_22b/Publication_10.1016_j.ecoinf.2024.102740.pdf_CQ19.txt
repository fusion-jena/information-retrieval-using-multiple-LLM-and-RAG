The given context does not provide specific details on the frameworks used to build the deep learning models mentioned in the papers. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch were utilized based solely on this information. To find out which framework was used, one would need access to the original research articles or contact the authors directly.
