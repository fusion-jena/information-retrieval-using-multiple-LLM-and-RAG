Based on the given context, it appears that the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves a combination of least squares methods via genetic algorithms and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach.

In the first step, the least squares algorithm is used to order the entries of the database from smaller to higher sum of the residual values. This operation ends the first step of the least squares algorithm and leads to the second part, defined as the genetic algorithm. This part of the process is based on an iterative optimization and its purpose is to partially optimize the results of the estimation and to better explore the space of the parameters.

In the second step, the first quarter of the best fit parameter values stored in the database is considered as input for the process. The algorithm then uses a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to obtain the distribution of the parameters.

It is not explicitly stated how the model performance is monitored during training, but it can be inferred that the performance is evaluated by comparing the estimated parameter values obtained from the least squares algorithm and the genetic algorithm with the actual parameter values. Additionally, the Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach allows for the calculation of the statistical distribution of the parameters, which can provide insight into the uncertainty associated with each parameter.

Overall, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves a combination of least squares methods via genetic algorithms and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to estimate the model parameters and obtain their distribution.
