The authors took several measures to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model. Firstly, they collected field measurements at three different field sites - Pelican Mountain (PM), Calling Lake (CL), and Conklin (CK). They used manual classification of fuel types for semantic segmentation training and testing, but this was limited to data collected at PM and CL. However, they used field measurement data and raw photos from the CK field site solely for independent validation. This suggests that they aimed to test their model on unseen data to evaluate its performance. Secondly, they employed data augmentation strategies such as horizontal flipping, adding Gaussian noise, and reducing contrast to increase the size of their training set fourfold. These techniques help prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data. Lastly, it appears that they used the R programming language and environment for statistical computing, which provides tools for cross-validation and stratified sampling. Although the paper does not explicitly mention these methods, it is likely that they were implemented during the development and evaluation of the deep learning model.
