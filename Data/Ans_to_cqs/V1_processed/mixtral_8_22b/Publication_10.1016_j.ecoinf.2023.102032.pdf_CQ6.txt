The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, based on general machine learning practices, common preprocessing steps may include data normalization, scaling, cleaning, and augmentation. These techniques help improve the quality and consistency of the input data, which can lead to better model performance. In this case, the context mentions moving the input period six months forward or backward and extending it to three instead of two years, which could suggest some form of temporal data manipulation as part of the preprocessing step. Nevertheless, without explicit information about the exact preprocessing steps used in this particular study, we cannot provide a definitive answer.
