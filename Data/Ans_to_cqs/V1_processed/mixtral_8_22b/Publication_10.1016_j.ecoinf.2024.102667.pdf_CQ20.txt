The papers cited do not provide information about the specific hardware resources used for training any deep learning models. The focus of these studies appears to be on analyzing various aspects of ecosystems and their response to environmental factors such as climate change or human interventions like ecological engineering programs. Therefore, I cannot determine which hardware resources were used for training deep learning models based solely on the given context.
