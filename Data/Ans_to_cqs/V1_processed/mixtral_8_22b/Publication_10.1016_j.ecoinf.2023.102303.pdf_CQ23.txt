Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model such as using diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the study uses a weakly labeled public FishInTurbidWater dataset for training and evaluation purposes. This could imply some level of diversity in the data used for training the model. Additionally, the authors propose two different DNN structures and compare them with each other and with fully supervised models, suggesting that they may have employed some form of validation techniques to assess the performance of their models. Nevertheless, without further details, it cannot be confirmed what exact measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
