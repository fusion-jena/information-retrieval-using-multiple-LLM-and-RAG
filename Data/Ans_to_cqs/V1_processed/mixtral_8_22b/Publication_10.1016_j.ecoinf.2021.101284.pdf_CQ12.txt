The paper does not provide specific details about the type of deep learning model used for image classification tasks. However, the reference to Castillo (2020) suggests that the authors may have employed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or other deep learning algorithms for early diagnosis of COVID-19 affected patients based on X-ray and computed tomography images. Therefore, without further clarification from the authors, we cannot definitively state which type of deep learning model was utilized in their study.
