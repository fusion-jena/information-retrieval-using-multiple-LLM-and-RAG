The text does not explicitly mention any specific strategies implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it discusses the use of BirdNET, a deep neural network developed for the automated detection and classification of bird vocalizations. It also mentions adjustments made to certain parameters like detection sensitivity, overlap of prediction segments, and minimum confidence threshold. These adjustments might indirectly reflect a form of monitoring model performance. Additionally, the text refers to previous studies that evaluated BirdNET's accuracy and recall rates for different bird species. This suggests that post-training evaluation methods were applied to assess the model's performance. Nevertheless, based solely on this information, it is unclear whether there were any specific strategies implemented to monitor the model performance during the actual training process.
