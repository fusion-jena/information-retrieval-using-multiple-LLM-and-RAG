Unfortunately, based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer some possible methods based on the nature of the tasks mentioned. For example, in the paper by Xiao et al. (2021), they classify weather phenomena from images using a deep convolutional neural network. This task might involve image-level labeling or multi-label classification, where each image is assigned one or more labels corresponding to the weather phenomena present in it. Similarly, in the work by Salman et al. (2019), real-time fish detection is performed using probabilistic background modeling. This could potentially involve object detection techniques like bounding boxes around detected fishes. Lastly, in the study by Schettini and Corchs (2010), underwater image processing is discussed, which may include various computer vision tasks such as object detection, semantic segmentation, or instance segmentation. Nevertheless, without clear information regarding the data annotation techniques employed in these studies, this remains speculative.
