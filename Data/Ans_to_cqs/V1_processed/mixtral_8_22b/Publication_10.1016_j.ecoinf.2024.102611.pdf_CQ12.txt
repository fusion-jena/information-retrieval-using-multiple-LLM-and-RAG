The given context does not explicitly state which specific type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline. However, it mentions several research papers that use various types of deep learning models for plant leaf recognition and classification tasks. These include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) such as VGG-16 and ResNet-50 architectures, as well as other unnamed deep learning models. Therefore, without further information, we cannot definitively determine the exact type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
