The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model include a batch size of 20 images, an RMSprop optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001, and a learning rate decay of 0.0001. The chosen loss function was mean squared error, while the prediction accuracy was quantified by the MAE of the respective dataset. The models were trained until the validation MAE did not further improve compared to the preceding epochs and diverged from the training MAE ('overfit'). All CNNs were implemented using the Keras API version (2.3.0.0) and the TensorFlow backend (version 2.2.0) in R (version 3.6.3). Model training was undergone on a workstation with two CUDA-compatible NVIDIA GPUs (GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, CUDA version 11.0).
