The provided context does not explicitly mention specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses the use of a repeated nested k-fold cross-validation approach to ensure accuracy and reliability of results in machine learning models. This approach can help prevent overfitting by providing a more robust evaluation of the model's performance. Additionally, Bayesian Optimization is mentioned for hyperparameter optimization during model development, which could potentially include regularization parameters. In summary, while the context does not directly address the query regarding regularization methods in deep learning pipelines, it does provide information about strategies used to improve model performance and prevent overfitting in machine learning models.
