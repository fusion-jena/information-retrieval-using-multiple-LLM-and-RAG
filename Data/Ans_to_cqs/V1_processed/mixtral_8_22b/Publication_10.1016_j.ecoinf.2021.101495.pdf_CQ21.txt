The paper does not provide explicit information on the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, based on common practices in machine learning projects, we can infer some possible postprocessing steps. These may include:

1. Model Evaluation: After training, models are typically evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc. This helps assess the performance of the model.

2. Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix is often used to visualize the performance of the model. It provides a summary of prediction results on a classification problem.

3. Saliency Maps: In deep learning applications, saliency maps can be generated to highlight important regions in the input data that contribute most to the predictions made by the model.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning: Posttraining, hyperparameters might need adjustment for optimal performance. Techniques like Grid Search or Randomized Search could be employed.

5. Predictions: Once the model has been trained and validated, it can be used to predict outcomes on new, unseen data.

Please note these are general possibilities and the actual postprocessing steps would depend on the specific requirements and objectives of the project.
