The given context does not provide information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or any mention of random seed values. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based solely on the provided context. However, some general strategies to manage randomness in deep learning pipelines include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, employing techniques like cross-validation, averaging predictions from different runs, or using ensemble methods to reduce variability caused by random initialization.
