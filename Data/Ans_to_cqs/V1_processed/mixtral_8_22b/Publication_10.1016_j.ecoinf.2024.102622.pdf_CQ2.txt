The given context primarily discusses research papers related to remote sensing and satellite data analysis, specifically focusing on applications such as crop type classification, leaf chlorophyll content retrieval, and monitoring of sugar beet growth indicators. Based on this context, it can be inferred that the primary data format used in these studies is image data, particularly multispectral and hyperspectral images captured by various satellites like Sentinel-2, Landsat-8/9, and other sources. These images provide valuable information about vegetation health, plant species distribution, and environmental conditions. Additionally, some studies may also use tabular data (such as CSV files) containing metadata, ground truth labels, or processed results for further analysis or model training purposes. However, there is no explicit mention of other data formats like audio or video being utilized within the provided context.
