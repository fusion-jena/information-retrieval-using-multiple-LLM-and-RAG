The information provided does not explicitly state where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it can be inferred that the data used in developing the REVIS system and validating the proposed framework came from Lewisham, Southwark, and Chepstow case studies. Additionally, the study mentions using Oracle Cloud instances to test scalability, which suggests that the data may have been stored there. Unfortunately, without more explicit information about the location of the data repository, I cannot provide a definitive answer.
