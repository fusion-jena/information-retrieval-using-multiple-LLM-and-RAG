The given context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, there are clues suggesting that the data format might be related to images. The text mentions "very high-resolution imagery" and "individual tree species mapping," which implies that the input data could be satellite or aerial images. Furthermore, the paper cites references related to aerial image classification and segmentation techniques like U-Net, which further supports the idea that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is likely to be images.
