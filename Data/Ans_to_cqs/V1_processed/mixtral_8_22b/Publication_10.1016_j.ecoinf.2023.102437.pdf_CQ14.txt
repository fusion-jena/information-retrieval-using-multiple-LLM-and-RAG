The paper titled "Enhancing land cover/land use (LCLU) classification through a comparative analysis of hyperparameters optimization approaches for deep neural network (DNN)" discusses various methods for optimizing hyperparameters of machine learning models. However, the specific details about how the hyperparameters were optimized in the given context are not explicitly mentioned. Therefore, based solely on the provided text, it cannot be determined whether techniques such as grid search, random search, or any other method were employed for hyperparameter optimization. It is recommended to refer to the original research article for more detailed information regarding the hyperparameter optimization process.
