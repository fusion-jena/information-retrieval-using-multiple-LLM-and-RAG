The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a random grid search approach. This method involves randomly selecting combinations of hyperparameter values from a specified range and evaluating their performance on the dataset. After trying multiple combinations, the best set of hyperparameters is chosen based on the highest accuracy or lowest error achieved during the evaluation process. In this case, the model parameters such as the number of trees, maximum depth of trees, subsample ratio of columns used for each tree, and model learning rate were all fine-tuned using this approach.
