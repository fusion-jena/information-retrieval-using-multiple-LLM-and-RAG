The training process uses 100 epochs with an early stopping function to halt the learning process if there is no improvement in accuracy after 20 epochs. This means that the training will continue until either it reaches 100 epochs or there is no improvement in accuracy for 20 consecutive epochs. Therefore, the criteria used to determine when training is complete are reaching 100 epochs or having no improvement in accuracy for 20 consecutive epochs.
