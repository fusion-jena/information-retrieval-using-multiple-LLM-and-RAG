In the given context, the authors use a specific criterion to split their data for training and validating their Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier. They identified 100 80x80 pixel image patches containing Ziziphus lotus shrubs and another 100 images for bare soil with sparse vegetation. These images were then divided into 80 images per class for training purposes and 20 images per class for validating the obtained CNN classifiers. This distribution is summarized in Table 1 within the context. Therefore, the authors employed a simple yet effective method of splitting their data, using a fixed ratio of 80% for training and 20% for validation.
