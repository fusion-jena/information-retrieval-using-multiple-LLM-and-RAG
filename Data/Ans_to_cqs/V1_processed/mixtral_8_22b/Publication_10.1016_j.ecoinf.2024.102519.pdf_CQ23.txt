Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the authors might have employed some form of validation technique such as cross-validation or stratified splitting due to their common usage in machine learning models. Additionally, they mentioned using genetic optimization algorithms to adjust hyperparameters which could also contribute towards improving the model's performance across different datasets. Nevertheless, without further details about the exact methods applied, we cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
