The purpose of the deep learning model used in this research is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, based on the keywords and the description of the methodology, it appears that the model was used for making predictions about Short-billed Gull abundance hotspots and coldspots using various open-access predictor layers such as socio-economic US Census data. It seems that the researchers employed an ensemble of machine learning models, which included Random Forest, TreeNet, CART, and MARS, to train, test, and evaluate their performance. Therefore, it can be inferred that the primary objective of the deep learning model was to classify or categorize different regions based on the predicted abundance of Short-billed Gulls.
