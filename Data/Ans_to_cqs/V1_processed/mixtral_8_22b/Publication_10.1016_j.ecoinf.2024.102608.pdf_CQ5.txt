Based on the given information, it appears that the study uses two types of datasets: Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data. These datasets are not explicitly mentioned as being part of a deep learning pipeline, but they are used to predict Chlorophyll-a (CHL-a), Secchi depth (SD), and total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations in reservoirs.

The Random Forest (RF) algorithm was found to provide the most accurate CHL-a predictions from these datasets, outperforming other machine learning algorithms like k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), AdaBoost, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). However, there is no specific mention of any well-known deep learning datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet in this context. Therefore, I cannot definitively determine which datasets were used in the deep learning pipeline, if one exists within this research.
