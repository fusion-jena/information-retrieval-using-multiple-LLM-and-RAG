Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does discuss the use of the TPEBO algorithm for hyperparameter optimization, which could indirectly contribute to improving the model's generalizability by finding optimal hyperparameters that prevent overfitting and improve overall performance. Additionally, the context mentions setting ranges for key hyperparameters like the number of cells in hidden layers and initial learning rates, which may help strike a balance between capturing intricate data patterns and avoiding overfitting. Nonetheless, without further information, it cannot be definitively stated what exact measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
