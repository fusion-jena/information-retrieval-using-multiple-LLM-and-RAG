The text mentions that the proposed model uses a deep learning (DL) model based on Tree-CA, which stands for Tree Pooling-based Channel Attention. However, it does not explicitly specify the base architecture of the deep learning model used in the pipeline. Nevertheless, there are indications that the model might use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as its foundation. For instance, the text discusses how feature extraction occurs hierarchically through CNNs from a global perspective. Additionally, the mention of using a Bayesian optimizer to control the output of each CNN further suggests that a CNN-based model could be employed. Therefore, while the exact type of deep learning model used in the pipeline isn't directly stated, evidence points towards the possibility of a CNN being utilized.
