The given text does not provide explicit information about the specific types of data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that various data formats such as images, audio, video, or structured data like CSV files could potentially be utilized depending on the problem domain and requirements. Deep learning algorithms have been applied across diverse fields including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, and more. For instance, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are commonly employed for image classification tasks, while recurrent neural networks (RNNs) find applications in sequential data analysis like speech signals or text sequences. Therefore, the choice of data format would depend on the nature of the task and the type of deep learning architecture being implemented.
