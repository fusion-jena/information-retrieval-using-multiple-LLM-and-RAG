The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the model is likely being used for image recognition or identification tasks related to marine mammals and fish habitats. Specifically, the model appears to be designed to distinguish between different beluga whales using contrastive loss functions and normalization techniques. Additionally, the mention of popular neural network architectures such as ResNet50 and DenseNet121 further suggests that the model may be used for image classification or object detection purposes.
