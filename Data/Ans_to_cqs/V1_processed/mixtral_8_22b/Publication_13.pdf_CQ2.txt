Based on the given context, the study primarily focuses on image data for its deep learning pipeline. Specifically, the research uses high-resolution images of various taxonomic groups (taxa) to train and validate Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for species identification tasks. Although other types of data such as audio or video might be relevant for similar studies, they are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, based solely on the information available, the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline appears to be images.
