Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization being used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss some techniques aimed at improving the performance of the neural network and addressing potential issues related to overfitting.

One technique mentioned is data augmentation using ACGAN, which helps increase the amount of available bird song spectrogram data. By doing so, the authors aim to improve the classification accuracy of the neural network without necessarily adding more complexity to the model itself.

Additionally, the text mentions increasing the depth of the network to improve its feature extraction capabilities. While this could potentially help the model better understand complex patterns within the data, it also acknowledges that increasing the network depth might lead to overfitting and require substantial computational resources.

As an alternative solution to overcome these challenges, the paper introduces dynamic convolution. Instead of using a single convolution kernel per layer, dynamic convolution employs a set of parallel convolution kernels that are dynamically aggregated by attention. This allows the model to generate an adaptive dynamic convolution tailored to the input, thereby achieving improved performance in tasks like ImageNet classification and COCO key point detection.

However, none of these techniques directly correspond to traditional regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, I cannot provide a direct answer regarding the use of specific regularization methods to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
