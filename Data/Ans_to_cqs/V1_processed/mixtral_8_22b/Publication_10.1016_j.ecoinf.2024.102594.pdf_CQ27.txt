The text does not provide explicit details about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, based on common practices in machine learning projects, once the model is trained using a framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch, it can be saved or serialized for later use. This involves saving the model architecture and its learned parameters (weights and biases) to disk. Later, this serialized model can be loaded back into memory for making predictions on new data. As for platform selection, since both model training and inference were executed on a GeForce RTX 3070 GPU, it can be assumed that the same or similar hardware might have been chosen for deploying the trained model. But again, these are assumptions based on typical workflows, as the specific deployment steps are not mentioned in the given context.
