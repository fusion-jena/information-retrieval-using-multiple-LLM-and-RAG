Based on the given references, it appears that there are no specific mentions of any standard datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in the deep learning pipelines discussed. However, reference [19] does mention the use of a large-scale benchmark dataset called IP102 for insect pest recognition. Additionally, reference [21] discusses the use of internal databases for pest detection and identification on tomato plants. Therefore, while we cannot provide information about widely known datasets, we do have some insight into custom or specialized datasets used in certain applications related to agriculture and pest management.
