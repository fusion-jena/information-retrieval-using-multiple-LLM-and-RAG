Unfortunately, based on the given information, I cannot provide the exact location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in GreenCam for GVI extraction. It appears that the authors created a custom dataset named UGE-D (Urban Green Extraction Dataset) specifically tailored for training the GVI-learning model. However, they did not mention any details about where this dataset can be accessed or downloaded.

It would be best to contact the original authors or refer to their published work for more detailed information regarding the availability of the UGE-D dataset.
