The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the context that the study involves remote sensing data, which often includes satellite imagery. Additionally, there is reference to texture parameters, suggesting that images might be one of the data formats used. Furthermore, the use of neural networks and stochastic gradient boosting algorithms also implies the potential involvement of numerical datasets, such as those stored in CSV format. Nevertheless, without explicit information about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, we cannot provide a definitive list of the exact data formats employed in the study.
