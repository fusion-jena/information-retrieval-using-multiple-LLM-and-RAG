The given context does not provide specific details about the dataset used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the data are divided into five equal folds in the proposed FAA-based approach. It also discusses the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and attention mechanisms for plant identification. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact dataset used in this case. Common datasets used in deep learning pipelines include MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet, among others. These datasets contain images of various objects and are commonly used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.
