In the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific data annotation techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does discuss the process of digitization and annotation under section 2.1, but without providing details about the exact methodology employed for annotation.

Furthermore, the text mentions the use of data augmentation transformations during the training phase. Data augmentation is a strategy used to expand the size of the dataset by applying various modifications to the original images, such as rotating, flipping, zooming, cropping, etc. These alterations help create additional training examples, thereby improving the model's ability to generalize and reducing the risk of overfitting.

Although not explicitly stated, one can infer that some form of image annotation must have been performed beforehand to provide ground truth labels for the supervised learning task. Depending upon the nature of the task, different types of annotations could be utilized, including bounding boxes, polygons, semantic segmentation, or instance segmentation. Nonetheless, based solely on the provided information, we cannot definitively determine the precise type(s) of annotation techniques employed in their deep learning pipeline.
