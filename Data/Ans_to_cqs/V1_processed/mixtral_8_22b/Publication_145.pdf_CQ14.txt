According to the given information, it appears that the hyperparameters of the model were not explicitly mentioned to be optimized through methods such as grid search or random search. However, some details about the optimization process can still be inferred.

In the context provided, it is stated that the model uses the optimizer RMSprop with an initial learning rate of 0.0001. This suggests that the learning rate was one of the hyperparameters considered during the optimization process. Furthermore, the model was trained for 300 epochs with 24 images per batch, indicating that the number of epochs and batch size were also taken into account as part of the optimization strategy.

While there isn't explicit mention of specific techniques like grid search or random search being employed, these choices of learning rate, number of epochs, and batch size could have been determined through experimentation or based on prior knowledge and experience. Therefore, although we cannot definitively state how the hyperparameters were optimized, we can infer that they were chosen carefully to achieve optimal performance.
