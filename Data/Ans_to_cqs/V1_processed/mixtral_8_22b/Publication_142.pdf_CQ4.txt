The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the CNN architecture used is the Inception model, which has been extended with batch normalization. This suggests that some form of data normalization was employed during the training process. Additionally, the text discusses the use of high-level image classifiers to filter out irrelevant images, indicating that image processing techniques were utilized. While the exact methods like flipping, rotating, or scaling are not mentioned, they may still have been part of the overall pipeline. Unfortunately, based solely on the provided context, I cannot confirm the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
