The given context does not provide information on data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it discusses the use of datasets in machine learning for modeling purposes. These datasets can include various types of labeled data, which may involve different annotation techniques like bounding boxes, semantic segmentation, or polygon annotations.

In general, data annotation techniques in deep learning pipelines depend on the specific task and application. For object detection tasks, bounding box annotation is commonly used to draw rectangles around objects of interest within images. Instance segmentation involves labeling individual pixels belonging to each distinct object instance, providing more detailed information about their shapes and locations. Other annotation techniques include semantic segmentation, key point annotation, and text annotation, among others.

However, based solely on the provided context, I am unable to specify the exact data annotation techniques employed in the described process.
