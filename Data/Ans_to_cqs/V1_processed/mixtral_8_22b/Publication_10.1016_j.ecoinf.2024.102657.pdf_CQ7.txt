The data was split into three parts - training set, validation set, and testing set. For each dialect class, the first 70% of songs in the folder were taken as the training set, the next 10% as the validation set, and the last 20% as the test set. This method aimed to reduce variability between tests. While the validation set was used to tune the hyperparameters of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the only hyperparameter of the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm was fixed as k = 4. Therefore, both the training and validation sets, totaling 80% of the full dataset, were used directly to fit the k-NN. As such, 80% of the full data set was used to train and validate the CNN spectrogram classifier and to train the k-NN location classifier, while the remaining 20% of the data set was reserved to test the two systemsâ€™ ability to classify songs correctly.
