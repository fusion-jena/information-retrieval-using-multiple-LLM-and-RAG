Unfortunately, there isn't any explicit information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model in the provided context. However, it does mention that since the 2012 ImageNet competition, new computational power accessible through latest GPU has made neural networks a strong possibility for classification tasks. Therefore, it can be inferred that GPUs might have been used for training the deep learning model. But without further details, it cannot be confirmed if other hardware resources like TPUs or CPUs were also utilized.
