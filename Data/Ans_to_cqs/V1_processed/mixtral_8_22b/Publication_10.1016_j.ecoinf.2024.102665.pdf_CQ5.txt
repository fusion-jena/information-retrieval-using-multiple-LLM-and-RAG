The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific dataset used in the deep learning pipelines. However, it mentions several studies that use machine learning techniques for various purposes related to coral reefs. For instance, Villon et al. (2021) developed automatic underwater fish species classification with limited data using few-shot learning. This suggests they might have used their own custom dataset for this purpose. Similarly, Do and Tran (2023) combined a deep learning model with an optimization algorithm to detect the dispersal of the early stages of spotted butterfish in northern Vietnam under global warming. Again, no specific dataset is mentioned, implying they could have used their own collected data. Other studies like Burns et al. (2022) and Sun et al. (2022) discuss using multiple machine-learning networks for reef image identification, but do not specify which datasets were utilized. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot determine the exact datasets employed in these deep learning pipelines.
