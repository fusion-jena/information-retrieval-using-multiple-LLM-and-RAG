Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily utilizes image data. Specifically, the study employs Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data and red, green, blue (RGB) images. LiDAR is a remote sensing method that measures distance to a target by illuminating the target with pulsed laser light and measuring the reflected pulses with a sensor. These measurements are typically visualized as point clouds or raster images. On the other hand, RGB images are standard digital images composed of three color channels - red, green, and blue. Therefore, both LiDAR and RGB images fall under the category of image data. However, there is no mention of any other data format such as audio, video, or CSV being used in this particular deep learning pipeline.
