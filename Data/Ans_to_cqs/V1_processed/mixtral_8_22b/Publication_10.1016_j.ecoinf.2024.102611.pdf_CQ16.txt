Based on the provided context, it appears that the authors use a combination of training, validation, and testing sets with a ratio of 70:20:10 respectively. However, there is no explicit mention of the criteria used to determine when training is complete. Typically, common criteria include reaching a certain number of epochs or iterations, early stopping when performance on a validation set stops improving, or when a desired level of accuracy or loss is achieved. Given the information available, we cannot definitively state what criteria were used in this study.
