The query asks about the evaluation metrics used for a deep learning model, but the provided context does not discuss any deep learning models or their evaluation metrics. Instead, the context focuses on various estimators used in forest inventories, such as the inventory estimator, NN1, NN2, NN3, and NN4 estimators. These estimators are used to calculate diversity indices in forest ecosystems. The discussion revolves around the relative root mean square error (rRMSE) of these estimators when applied to different diversity indices.

Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to the query using the given context, as it does not contain any relevant information regarding the evaluation metrics for deep learning models.
