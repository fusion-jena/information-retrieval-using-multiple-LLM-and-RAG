The information provided does not explicitly state the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the primary data format used is images since the study focuses on image classification using ResNet-50, which is a convolutional neural network commonly used for image recognition tasks. Additionally, the mention of MegaDetector suggests that the input data consists of images, as this tool is specifically designed for object detection in images. Therefore, based on the given context, it can be concluded that the main data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images.
