The text does not provide explicit information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning models, such as learning rates or optimizers. However, it mentions that ResNet18 and ResNet50 were trained with the same hyperparameters. Additionally, it discusses how certain hyperparameters like depth, batch normalization, and weight decay can impact the calibration of the network. Unfortunately, without more detailed information, we cannot determine the exact values of these hyperparameters.
