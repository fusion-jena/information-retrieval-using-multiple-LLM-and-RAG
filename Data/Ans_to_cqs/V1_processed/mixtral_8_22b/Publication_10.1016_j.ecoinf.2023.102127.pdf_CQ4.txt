The given context does not provide information on specific data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline like flipping, rotation, scaling etc. However, it discusses various methods used in integrated Species Distribution Models (SDMs) which can be considered as a form of data augmentation. These include factor interactions, multinomial predictions using convolutional neural networks, and co-occurrences through joint SDM frameworks. It also mentions that these models are heavily dependent on the availability and quality of data at adequate scales.
