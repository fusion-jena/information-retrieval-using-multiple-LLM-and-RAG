The text does not provide explicit information on the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions using Google Earth Engine and Landsat images, which suggests that remote sensing satellite imagery is one source of data collection. Additionally, the focus on phenological features implies that temporal data related to plant life cycles might be collected through ground observations or other means. But without additional context, it cannot be confirmed what exact methods were employed for gathering raw data.
