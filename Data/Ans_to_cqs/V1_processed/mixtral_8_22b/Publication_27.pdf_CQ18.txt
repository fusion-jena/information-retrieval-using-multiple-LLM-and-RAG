The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using a validation set and tracking metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve. Additionally, learning curves are used to visualize the progress of the model over time. Model checkpointing is also employed to save the best models based on their performance on the validation set. Furthermore, TensorBoard is utilized for real-time monitoring of various metrics and parameters during the training process.
