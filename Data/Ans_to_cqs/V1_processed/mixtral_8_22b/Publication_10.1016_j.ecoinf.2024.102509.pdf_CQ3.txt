The given context does not provide information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it discusses the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), specifically Backpropagation Artificial Neural Networks (BP-ANNs), in modeling and predictive analysis. It also mentions the importance of high-quality and large datasets for accurate training of these networks.

To address the query directly, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include:

1. Bounding Box Annotation: This technique involves drawing boxes around objects within images to identify their location and size. It is commonly used in object detection tasks.

2. Instance Segmentation: This technique goes beyond bounding boxes and provides pixel-level classification of each object in an image. It is useful when precise object boundaries are required.

3. Semantic Segmentation: Unlike instance segmentation, semantic segmentation classifies every pixel into a category without differentiating instances of the same category.

4. Landmark Annotation: This technique involves identifying key points on objects within images. It is often used in facial recognition systems.

5. Polygon Annotation: Similar to bounding boxes, polygonal shapes are drawn around objects but offer more precision by allowing irregular shapes.
