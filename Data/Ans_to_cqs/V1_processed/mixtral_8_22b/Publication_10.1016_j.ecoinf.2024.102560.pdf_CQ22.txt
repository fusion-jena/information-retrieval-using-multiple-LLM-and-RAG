Based on the given context, it does not provide information about any deep learning models or their evaluation metrics. However, generally speaking, common metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, and confusion matrix. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of total instances. Precision indicates the ratio of true positives to all predicted positives. Recall calculates the fraction of relevant instances retrieved among all relevant instances. The F1 score combines both precision and recall into a single metric. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve plots True Positive Rate against False Positive Rate, while a confusion matrix summarizes the number of correctly and incorrectly classified instances.
