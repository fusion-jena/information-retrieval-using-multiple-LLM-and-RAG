The study employed a training-and-test approach with stratified splitting. Each setting had 100 different splits into training and testing sets. Hyperparameters were tuned on the training set for each split, followed by model training using the optimal hyperparameter settings. Four regression models were used: AdaBoost, random decision forest (RF), multilayer neural network (NET), and Bayesian ridge regression (Bayes). Nonparametric machine learning models have become popular for estimating forest biomass based on ALS data. Model performance was evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy with assigned tolerances (AC\_T1 and AC\_T2), root mean squared error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), cross-validation R2 (CV\_R2), and average angle deviation from the line 1:1 for samples (AD). These metrics were calculated for both test and all samples. However, it is not explicitly mentioned how these metrics were monitored during the training process. It can be assumed that they were used after the completion of training to evaluate the final model performance rather than monitoring them continuously during training.
