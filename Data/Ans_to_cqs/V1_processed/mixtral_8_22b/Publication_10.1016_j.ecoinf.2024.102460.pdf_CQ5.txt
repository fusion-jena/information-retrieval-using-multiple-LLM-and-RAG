Unfortunately, the given context does not explicitly mention any specific dataset used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the study uses an LSTM model for time series forecasting and a PLUS model for analyzing the driving mechanism of land expansion and exploring the land conversion pattern. It also discusses the use of a fuzzy multiobjective programming (FMOP) model. Therefore, without additional information, I cannot determine which specific datasets were used in their deep learning pipeline.
