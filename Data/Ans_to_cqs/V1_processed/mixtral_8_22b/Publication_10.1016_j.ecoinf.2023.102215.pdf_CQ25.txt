The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is binary classification. This is indicated by the statement "Our study can be categorized as a binary classification" in section 2.3 titled "Model Training". The model, referred to as TrunkNet, is trained using the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss function, which is commonly used in supervised deep learning for measuring the difference between the predicted probability and the actual value. Minimizing this difference indicates a better training effect. The specific formula for the BCE loss function used in this case is also provided.
