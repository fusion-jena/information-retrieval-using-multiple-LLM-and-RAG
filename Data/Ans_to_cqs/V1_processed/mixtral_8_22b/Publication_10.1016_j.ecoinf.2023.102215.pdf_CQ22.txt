The paper uses several metrics to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, specifically for salient tree trunk detection. These include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), F-measure (Fβ), Weighted F-measure (Fωβ), Precision, Recall, Structural measure (S-measure), and Enhanced-alignment Measure (E-measure). MAE assesses the pixel-level similarity between the final saliency map and the ground truth mask. F-measure combines precision and recall into a single statistic, while Weighted F-measure handles unreasonable comparison caused by flaws of prediction. Precision and Recall are common evaluation metrics in machine learning. S-measure evaluates region-aware and object-aware structural similarities, while E-measure jointly considers local pixel values and their image-level statistics.
