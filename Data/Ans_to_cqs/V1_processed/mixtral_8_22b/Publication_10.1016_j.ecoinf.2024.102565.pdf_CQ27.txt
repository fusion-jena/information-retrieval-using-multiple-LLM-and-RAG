Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available in the given context to provide a specific answer regarding the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. Typically, after training a deep learning model, it can be deployed through various methods such as model serialization, where the model is saved in a file format that can be loaded later for use, or platform selection, which involves choosing a suitable environment for running the model, such as cloud services or edge devices. However, without further details about the specific case mentioned in the context, I cannot provide a more precise response.
