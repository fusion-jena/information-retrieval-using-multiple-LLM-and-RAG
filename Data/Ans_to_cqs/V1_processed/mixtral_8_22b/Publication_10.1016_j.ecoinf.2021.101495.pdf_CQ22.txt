The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the deep learning models mentioned. However, we can infer that accuracy might be one of the metrics used since the text mentions that data augmentation helps the model learn with better accuracy. Other common evaluation metrics for deep learning models include precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC), among others. Without more detailed information, it would be speculative to state which exact metrics were employed in evaluating these models.
