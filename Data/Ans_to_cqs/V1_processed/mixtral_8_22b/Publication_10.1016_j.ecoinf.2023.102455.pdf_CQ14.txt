In this study, the Bayesian Optimization program was employed to optimize hyperparameters associated with machine learning algorithms. Unlike traditional methods like grid search or random search, Bayesian optimization offers a more efficient approach for hyperparameter tuning. By leveraging Bayesian optimization, the algorithm explores the hyperparameter space by choosing the subsequent set of hyperparameters to evaluate based on previous assessments. In this research, optimal hyperparameters were achieved through the application of the Bayesian optimization technique linked with various complementary models for one-day and three-days-ahead prediction of streamflow values. For instance, Table 3 displays the optimal hyperparameters acquired via the Bayesian optimization strategy connected with different complementary models for one-day and three-days-ahead projections of streamflow data.
