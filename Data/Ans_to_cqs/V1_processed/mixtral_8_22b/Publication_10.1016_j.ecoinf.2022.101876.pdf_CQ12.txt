The pipeline uses a deep learning model called Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN). It is a type of convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for object detection tasks. The model works in two stages: it first identifies potential regions containing objects within an image, then classifies the detected objects based on their features. In this case, the Faster R-CNN model was trained using hundreds of thousands of images labeled through manual human review, and can classify objects as either animals, humans, or trucks.
