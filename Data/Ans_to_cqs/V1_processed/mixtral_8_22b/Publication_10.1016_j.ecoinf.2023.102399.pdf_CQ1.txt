The paper does not provide explicit details about the method used for collecting raw data in their deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of underwater stereo images for recognizing the head and mouth of Southern Bluefin tuna. This suggests that they might have collected raw data using cameras or other imaging devices installed in deep-sea cages where the fish were being cultured. Additionally, the authors discuss obtaining high-quality images through a fully automated biomass estimation method, which implies that they could be utilizing some form of automated data collection process. Nevertheless, the exact methodology employed for gathering raw data remains unspecified in the given context.
