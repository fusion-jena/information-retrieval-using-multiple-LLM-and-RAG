The process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model involved saving the model after each epoch for later use. This was done using the `SaveModelCallback` function within the `fit_one_cycle()` method. The saved models were then made available online via Zenodo (<https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5164796>). However, due to the high computational requirements of the model, a full reproducible analysis could not be provided. Instead, a subsample of the dataset was used for demonstration purposes, as detailed in the appendix. It is also mentioned that the model was trained on a platform using a GPU machine (Titan Xp Nvidia) with 16GB of RAM, taking approximately 10 hours for 20 epochs.
