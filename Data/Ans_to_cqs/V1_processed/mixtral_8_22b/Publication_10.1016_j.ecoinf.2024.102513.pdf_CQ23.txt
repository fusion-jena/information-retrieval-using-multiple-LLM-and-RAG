To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were implemented. Firstly, the integration of auxiliary data, such as climate or soil characteristics, was used to strengthen the neural network's generalization capability. This approach allowed the model to leverage insights from additional datasets, thereby improving its predictive power even in historical periods with limited direct data. Secondly, transfer learning techniques were employed to enable the model to make informed predictions based on these auxiliary datasets. These techniques helped the model adapt to new situations by applying knowledge gained from previous tasks, thus enhancing its overall performance and robustness. Lastly, the use of a diverse dataset was also crucial in ensuring the model's generalizability. A diverse dataset exposed the model to a wide range of examples, allowing it to learn more comprehensive patterns and relationships between variables. This diversity helped prevent overfitting and improved the model's ability to handle unseen data accurately. In summary, the combination of integrating auxiliary data, employing transfer learning techniques, and utilizing a diverse dataset contributed significantly to maintaining the generalizability of the deep learning model.
