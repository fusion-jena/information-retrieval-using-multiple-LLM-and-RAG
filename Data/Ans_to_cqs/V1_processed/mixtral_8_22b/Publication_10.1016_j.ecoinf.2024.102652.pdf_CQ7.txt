The given text mentions that the satellite images were split into 70% and 30% for training and testing, respectively. However, it does not explicitly state any specific criteria used to split the data. In general, when splitting data for machine learning or deep learning models, one common approach is to randomly divide the dataset into three subsets: training, validation, and testing sets. This random division helps ensure that each subset has similar statistical properties to the original dataset. Another approach could be stratified sampling, where the splits maintain the same distribution of classes as in the original dataset. Without further information from the authors, we cannot determine which method they employed for this study.
