The deep learning pipeline primarily uses static images and living videos of a commercial orchard, RGB-images and point cloud data of a commercial orchard, RGB-images of a single tree branch, RGB-images of urban streets, synthetic images and natural images of forests, and RGB-images of a modern apple orchard. These datasets consist mainly of visual data formats such as images and videos. There is no mention of other data formats like audio, text, or CSV files being used in the given context.
