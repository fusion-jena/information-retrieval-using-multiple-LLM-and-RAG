The context does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed for the proposed models. However, it mentions that the performance of the models increases with the number of epochs and the amount of training data. This suggests that the authors might have used some form of early stopping or convergence criterion based on the performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, or F1-score. In Figure 8, the authors present the accuracy of training sets at different epochs for each of the four modules (Tree-CA, Gated-CA, Mixed-CA, and GAP-CA). Based on these graphs, one could infer that the authors may have chosen a certain threshold for the desired level of accuracy or another metric to decide when to stop training. Nevertheless, without more detailed information from the original paper, we cannot definitively state what specific criteria were used to determine when training was complete.
