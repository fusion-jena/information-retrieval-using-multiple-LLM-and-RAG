The performance of the deep learning model, specifically SegFormer, is evaluated using several metrics such as mean Intersection over Union (mIOU), accuracy, and F1-score. These metrics help assess the quality of the segmentation output produced by the model. Additionally, other factors like inference time and number of parameters are also considered while comparing it with other models.
