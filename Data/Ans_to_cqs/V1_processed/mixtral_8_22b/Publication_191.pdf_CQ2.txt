The given context primarily discusses the use of deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for plant species classification. From the information available, it appears that the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is images. Specifically, the authors mention various datasets such as MS COCO, Places2, Sport-1M, Visual Genome QA, ILSVRC 2010, and PlantClef2015 dataset, all of which contain images. They also describe preprocessing steps involving leaves and their respective images. However, there is no explicit mention of other data formats like audio, video, or CSV being utilized in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be concluded that the main data format employed in this case is images.
