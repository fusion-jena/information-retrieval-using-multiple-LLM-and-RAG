The given text does not provide information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it mentions that big data theory and technology, neural networks, and other deep-level data mining methods have been applied to understand the impact of climate differences on selected variables and the overall prediction ability of relevant models. This suggests that some form of large dataset is being utilized for this analysis. Additionally, the use of random forest models implemented through R statistical software indicates that machine learning techniques are employed in the study. Unfortunately, without further details regarding the nature of these datasets, I cannot provide more specific information about their content or origin.
