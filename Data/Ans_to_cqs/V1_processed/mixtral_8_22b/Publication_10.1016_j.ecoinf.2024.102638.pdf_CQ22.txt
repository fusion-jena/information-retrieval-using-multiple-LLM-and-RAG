The text does not mention a deep learning model specifically but discusses various performance evaluation metrics used to measure the performance accuracy and suitability of prediction models. These include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Mean Absolute Scale Error (MASE), and Coefficient of Determination (R^2). Each metric is defined mathematically in equations (2)-(7) within the given context. However, it should be noted that these metrics are not exclusive to deep learning models and can be applied to any predictive modeling task.
