The authors did not explicitly mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, they mentioned adapting and configuring TensorFlow for their project and adjusting two parameters - validation percentage and number of training steps - from their default values. They also mentioned exploring different numbers of training steps and comparing the results to find the optimum balance between computing time and classification efficiency. Additionally, they calibrated their models for Mexican and Brazilian species using different numbers of training steps and considered factors like correct identification rate and processing time to find optima for training TensorFlow. These actions suggest that the authors took steps to optimize the performance of their deep learning model, though explicit measures for ensuring its generalizability are not directly stated.
