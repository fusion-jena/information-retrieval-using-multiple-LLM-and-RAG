Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available from the given context to provide a detailed explanation about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, typically, after training a deep learning model like CNN, the next step would be to serialize or save the model using popular libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. This serialized model can then be deployed on various platforms depending upon the use case. For instance, if the application requires real-time processing, edge devices like NVIDIA Jetson could be chosen. On the other hand, cloud services like AWS SageMaker or Google Cloud AI Platform might be more suitable for large scale applications. But without specific details regarding this particular study, these steps remain speculative.
