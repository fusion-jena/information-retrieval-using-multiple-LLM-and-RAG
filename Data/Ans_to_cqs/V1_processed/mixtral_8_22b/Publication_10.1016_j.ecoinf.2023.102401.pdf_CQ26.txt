In the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it does discuss data augmentation techniques used to improve the training dataset and enhance the learning effect and generalization performance of the network. These techniques include HSV adjustment, rotation, scaling, cropping, flipping, and mosaicking. While these techniques do not directly address data bias, they help increase the diversity of the dataset and potentially mitigate some forms of bias by introducing variations in the data. Nevertheless, addressing data bias typically requires more targeted strategies like those mentioned in the query.
