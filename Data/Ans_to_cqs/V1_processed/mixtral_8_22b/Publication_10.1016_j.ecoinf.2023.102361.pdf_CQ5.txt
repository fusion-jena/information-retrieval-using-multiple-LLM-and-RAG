The text does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the dataset was shared by Jiang et al. (2020) through the GitHub repository: https://github.com/zhangchuanyin/weed-datasets. Therefore, one of the datasets used could be from this source. Additionally, the text refers to the DeepWeeds dataset, indicating that this dataset was also used in the study. Unfortunately, no further information about the datasets is provided in the given context.
