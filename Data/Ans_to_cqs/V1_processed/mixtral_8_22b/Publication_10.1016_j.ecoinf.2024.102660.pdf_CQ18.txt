To monitor the model performance during training, the study utilized 176 image pairs from the total 1764 image pairs for validation purposes. These image pairs were used to validate the model accuracy during the training phase. Additionally, the learning rate was adjusted using the equal-interval adjustment strategy (StepLR), halving the original rate every 10 epochs of iteration. This approach helped ensure that the model did not overfit or underfit the training data, thereby maintaining optimal performance.
