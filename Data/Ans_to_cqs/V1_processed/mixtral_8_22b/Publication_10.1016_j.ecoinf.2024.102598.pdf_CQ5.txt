The given context does not mention any specific dataset used in a deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it discusses the use of ensemble modeling in enhancing predictive accuracy, increasing stability, improving generalization, providing robustness against overfitting, and increasing model interpretability. It mentions using data mining techniques to extract valuable information from large datasets related to forest fires and simulation models to recreate fire behavior and spread under various conditions. Additionally, it highlights the use of machine learning models like support vector machines, neural networks, kernel logistic regression, random forests, and other emerging models to predict forest fire risk zonation. Model ensembling is mentioned as a way to improve the predictive ability of forest fire susceptibility in large-scale studies. Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot provide the names of the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
