The purpose of the deep learning model presented in the given context is for image segmentation. Specifically, it aims to automate the segmentation of fish images, which involves identifying and separating the fish bodies from the background in digital images. This is achieved by using a convolutional neural network (CNN), which has been trained using transfer learning with pre-trained COCO weights. The overall goal is to develop a toolkit that enables rapid and accurate high-throughput image segmentation of digitized organisms, including fishes that may not be represented within existing datasets like COCO.
