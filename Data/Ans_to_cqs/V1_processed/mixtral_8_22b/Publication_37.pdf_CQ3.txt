Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the study explores two state-of-the-art classification techniques for large vocabulary bird species classification from flight calls: a shallow learning unsupervised dictionary learning method and a deep convolutional neural network combined with data augmentation. These methods do not explicitly mention any specific data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine which data annotation techniques were used in the deep learning pipeline.
