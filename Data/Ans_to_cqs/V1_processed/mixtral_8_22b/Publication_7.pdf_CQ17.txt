The authors do not explicitly mention any specific regularization techniques used in their deep learning pipeline to prevent overfitting. However, they discuss using pre-trained models like VGGnet and fine-tuning them with domain-specific datasets. This approach can be considered a form of transfer learning, which often helps reduce overfitting by leveraging knowledge gained from training on larger datasets. Additionally, while not mentioned directly, it is common practice to employ regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization when working with deep learning architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Dropout randomly sets a fraction of input units to 0 during training time, helping to avoid co-adaptation between neurons. On the other hand, L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, discouraging large weight values and promoting simpler models. These techniques could potentially be part of the deep learning pipeline but are not explicitly stated in the given context.
