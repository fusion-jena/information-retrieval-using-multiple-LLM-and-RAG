The given context does not provide explicit information on the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the context that the study uses various types of land cover data such as urban areas, sparse vegetation, croplands, mosaics of croplands and natural vegetation, tree covers, etc. These data could have been collected using remote sensing techniques like satellite imagery, drones, LiDAR, etc. Additionally, the mention of 'open data entries' suggests that publicly available datasets might also have been used. Nevertheless, without more detailed information about the study's methodology, it is impossible to definitively state what methods were used for collecting raw data.
