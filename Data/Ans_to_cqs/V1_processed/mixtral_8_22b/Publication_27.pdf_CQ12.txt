The text does not provide explicit information about the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, based on the context and the mention of image processing tasks such as segmentation and classification, it can be inferred that a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) might have been employed for these purposes. Nevertheless, without further details or confirmation, this remains speculative.
