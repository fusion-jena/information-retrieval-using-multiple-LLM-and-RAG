The text does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, based on common machine learning practices, some possible criteria include reaching a certain number of epochs, achieving a desired accuracy or loss value on the validation set, or observing no further improvement in validation metrics after a certain number of iterations (validation loss plateau). The authors do mention using a validation dataset to assess model performance, suggesting that they likely use some form of validation metric to decide when training should stop. Additionally, they emphasize the importance of avoiding overly optimistic or unrealistic performance estimates, implying that they may prioritize robustness and generalization over maximizing validation scores.
