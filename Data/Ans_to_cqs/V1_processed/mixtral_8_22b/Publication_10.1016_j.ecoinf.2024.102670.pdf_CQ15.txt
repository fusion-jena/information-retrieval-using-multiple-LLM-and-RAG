The given context does not provide specific details about the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it mentions that Guo et al. (2021) used a deep learning-based model to classify points of interest in 3D volumetric images. This suggests that some form of optimization technique would have been employed during training of this model, but the exact technique remains unspecified within the provided context.
