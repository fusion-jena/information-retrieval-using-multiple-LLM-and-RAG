The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. In this study, the ML bounding box model achieved an overall accuracy of 92.2%. The true positive rate or sensitivity, which measures the proportion of actual positives correctly identified by the model, was 45.2%. The true negative rate, which indicates the proportion of actual negatives correctly identified by the model, was 47.0%. False positive and false negative rates were 4.2% and 3.6%, respectively. Precision, calculated as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true and false positives, was 92.6%. Recall, computed as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives, was 91.5%.
