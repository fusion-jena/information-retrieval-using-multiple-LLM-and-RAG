The article discusses several deep learning models used for object detection in camera trap images, specifically for bird recognition. These models include Cascade RCNN, FCOS, Sparse CNN, Faster CNN, ATSS, and RepPoint. All of these models fall under the category of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). CNNs are a class of artificial neural networks that have proven very effective in areas such as image recognition and processing. They are designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from tasks with grid-like topology, such as an image.
