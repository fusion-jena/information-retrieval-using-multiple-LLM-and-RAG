The deep learning pipeline described in the given context uses Sentinel-2 optical images as input data format. These images are processed using a deep learning approach involving Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to create a high-resolution Canopy Height Model (CHM) of the Earth at 10 meters resolution. Therefore, the primary data format utilized in this deep learning pipeline is image data.
