The provided context does not directly address the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some general techniques can be applied to manage randomness in machine learning models, including deep learning pipelines. These methods include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using ensemble methods to reduce variance caused by randomness, and employing cross-validation or bootstrap sampling to evaluate model performance more robustly. Additionally, advanced optimization algorithms like Bayesian Optimization can help tune hyperparameters while accounting for randomness. Nonetheless, it should be noted that these strategies may not be explicitly mentioned or utilized within the given context.
