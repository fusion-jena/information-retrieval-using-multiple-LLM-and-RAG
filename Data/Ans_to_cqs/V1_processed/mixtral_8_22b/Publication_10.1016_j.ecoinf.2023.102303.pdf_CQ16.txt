Based on the provided context, there isn't explicit information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, common practices in machine learning include using validation loss plateaus, where training stops once the validation loss stops decreasing significantly over several epochs. Other possible criteria could be reaching a predefined maximum number of epochs or achieving a target performance metric such as accuracy or precision. Without more specific details, it would be difficult to provide a definitive answer based solely on the given context.
