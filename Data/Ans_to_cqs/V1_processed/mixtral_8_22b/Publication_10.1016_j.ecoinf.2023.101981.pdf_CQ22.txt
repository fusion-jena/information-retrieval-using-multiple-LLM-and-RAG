The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using two main metrics: recall rate and precision. The recall rate is calculated by dividing the number of cow calls detected by the model by the total number of cow calls present in the sound recordings. It serves as an index of the percentage of calls that the recognizer is capable of detecting. On the other hand, precision is determined by dividing the number of cow calls identified by the software by the overall number of Regions Of Interest (ROIs) within the "Cow" cluster. This metric can be understood as an indicator of the proportion of ROIs accurately labeled by the model.
