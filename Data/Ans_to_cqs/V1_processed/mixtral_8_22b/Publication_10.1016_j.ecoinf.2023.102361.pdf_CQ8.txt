The text does not explicitly mention where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it mentions that the dataset used in the study was shared by Jiang et al. (2020) through the Github repository: https://github.com/zhangchuanyin/weed-datasets. Therefore, it could be possible that the code repository might also be available on Github or another similar platform. Unfortunately, without further information, I cannot confirm the exact location of the code repository.
