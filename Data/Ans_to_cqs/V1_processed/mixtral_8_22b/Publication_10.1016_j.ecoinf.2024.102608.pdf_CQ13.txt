The study uses several machine learning models including Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, AdaBoost, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to predict CHL-a, SD, and TSS using surface reflectance values from Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat-8 OLI imagery. However, only ANN is considered a type of deep learning model. For the ANN model, the hyperparameters used include hidden layer sizes, activation function, solver, alpha, and learning rate. Unfortunately, the specific values for these hyperparameters are not mentioned in the given context.

Unhelpful 
The study does not provide information on the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
