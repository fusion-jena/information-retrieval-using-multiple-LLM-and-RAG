The text does not provide specific information about the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, given that the task involves identifying classes in images, it can be inferred that a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) might have been employed due to its effectiveness in handling image data. Nevertheless, without explicit mention or further context, this remains speculative.
