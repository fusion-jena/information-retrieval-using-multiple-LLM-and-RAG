The provided context does not contain specific information about the hyperparameters used in any particular deep learning model. However, some common hyperparameters used in deep learning include learning rate, optimizer, batch size, number of epochs, and regularization parameters like weight decay or dropout rate. These hyperparameters can significantly impact the performance of a deep learning model and need to be carefully tuned based on the problem domain and available data. For example, the learning rate controls how much the weights of the network should change during each iteration of optimization, while the choice of optimizer determines the algorithm used to update these weights. Commonly used optimizers include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop. The batch size specifies the number of samples processed before updating the internal model parameters, while the number of epochs refers to the total number of times the entire dataset is passed forward and backward through the neural network during training. Regularization techniques like weight decay and dropout help prevent overfitting by adding constraints to the complexity of the learned model. To determine the optimal values for these hyperparameters, various methods such as grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and evolutionary algorithms can be employed.
