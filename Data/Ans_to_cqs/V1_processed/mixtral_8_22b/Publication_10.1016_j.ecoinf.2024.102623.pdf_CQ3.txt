The given context does not provide specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, generally speaking, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and labeling. Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangles around objects in images to identify them. Semantic segmentation involves assigning a label to every pixel in an image, while instance segmentation involves identifying individual instances of objects within an image. Polygon annotation involves tracing the outline of objects in images, and key point annotation involves marking specific points on objects in images. Labeling involves assigning labels to entire images or parts of images. These techniques can be used alone or in combination depending on the requirements of the project.
