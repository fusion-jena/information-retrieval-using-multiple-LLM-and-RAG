The provided context does not explicitly mention which specific hardware resources were used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. However, it is mentioned that the IUC-NN algorithm is based on the Python TensorFlow library, which can utilize both CPUs and GPUs for computation. Therefore, it can be inferred that either CPUs, GPUs, or possibly even TPUs could have been employed during the training process. Nevertheless, without explicit information regarding the hardware resources utilized, one cannot definitively state whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware components were specifically used for training the deep learning model.
