The authors used the hold-out method to divide the dataset into training and testing sets at a ratio of 3:7. This means that they allocated 70% of their data for training purposes and reserved the remaining 30% for testing. They did not explicitly mention using a separate validation set; however, it is common practice in machine learning to use a portion of the training data as a validation set during the training phase to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.
