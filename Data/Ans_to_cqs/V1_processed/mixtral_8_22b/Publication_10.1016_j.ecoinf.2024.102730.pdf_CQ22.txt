The authors used three standard metrics to evaluate the performance of their deep learning models: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Average Error (MAE), and the Coefficient of Determination (r2). They primarily focused on minimizing the MSE during the grid search process to identify the optimal set of hyperparameters. These metrics help measure the quality of the model's predictions and its overall performance.
