Based on the given context, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not explicitly mentioned. However, typically, the data is divided into three sets: training, testing, and validation. The training set is used to train the model, the testing set is used to evaluate its performance after training, and the validation set is used during the training process to fine-tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. In this case, the data acquisition involved querying the API of Xeno-Cano and setting certain parameters such as audio quality, duration, maximum number of recordings per species, and geographic coordinates. These parameters could potentially influence how the data is split, depending on the specific approach taken for splitting the data. For instance, one might choose to stratify the data based on these parameters to ensure balanced representation across different categories in each set. However, without further information, it cannot be definitively stated what criteria were used to split the data in this particular case.
