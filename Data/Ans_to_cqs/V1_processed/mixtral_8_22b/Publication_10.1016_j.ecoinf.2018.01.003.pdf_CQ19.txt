The given context does not provide specific details about the frameworks or libraries used to build the deep learning model. It only mentions that since 2006, deep learning algorithms have broken the limitations of traditional neural networks regarding the number of layers, allowing them to extract deeply hidden characteristics and features using large-scale data training. The text also discusses comparisons between the Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) model and Support Vector Machine (SVM) model but does not mention any specific deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
