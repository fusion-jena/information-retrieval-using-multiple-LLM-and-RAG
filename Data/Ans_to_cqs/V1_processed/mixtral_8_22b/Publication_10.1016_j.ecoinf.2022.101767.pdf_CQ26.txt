To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. One such technique is stratified splitting, which involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same proportion of classes in both sets. This ensures that the model is trained and tested on representative samples of all classes, reducing any potential bias towards certain classes. Another technique is oversampling, where examples from minority classes are duplicated to balance out the class distribution. Conversely, undersampling involves removing examples from majority classes to achieve a similar effect. Both oversampling and undersampling aim to create a balanced dataset, thereby mitigating any potential biases caused by imbalanced class distributions. Additionally, diverse data collection can also help reduce data bias by ensuring that the dataset includes a wide range of examples representing different demographics, scenarios, and use cases. In summary, various techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection can be utilized to minimize data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
