The given context does not provide specific information about the hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model. However, it mentions that using a pre-trained CNN feature extractor and adding a softmax output layer can reduce complexity and the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning. It also states that their findings showed that results could be obtained within 9 hours (10 epochs of fine-tuning the feature extractor), indicating that some form of optimization process took place. Unfortunately, without further details, we cannot determine the exact values of the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
