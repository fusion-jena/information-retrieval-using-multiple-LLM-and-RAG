The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is called early stopping. It is a process that stops growing additional trees/layers/splits when further addition of more trees/layers/splits does not improve the validation statistic. In this case, the validation statistic includes the R^2 value for a continuous response. For the entire machine learning model, early stopping was enabled so that the model would not overfit the predicted percentage of Cotton Leaf Curl Disease (CLCuD). Additionally, to address the tendency of neural networks to overfit data, the penalty method was employed within the framework of artificial neural network (ANN) models.
