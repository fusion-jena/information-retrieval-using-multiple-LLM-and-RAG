None of the provided sources directly address the specific issue of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or managing random seed values. However, some general principles can be applied to manage randomness in machine learning pipelines. One common strategy is to use cross-validation techniques, such as k-fold cross-validation, which helps reduce overfitting and provides more robust performance estimates. Another approach is to set a fixed random seed before training the model, ensuring reproducibility across different runs. Additionally, ensemble methods like bagging and boosting can help mitigate the effects of randomness by combining multiple models trained on different subsets of the data.
