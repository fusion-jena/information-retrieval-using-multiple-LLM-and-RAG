Regularization methods are techniques used to prevent overfitting in machine learning and deep learning models. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the noise or outliers in the training data instead of generalizing from the underlying pattern. Two common regularization methods mentioned in the given context are dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to reduce interdependent learning among them. By ignoring some neurons, the model becomes more robust and less likely to rely too heavily on any single feature. Dropout is often applied between layers in a deep learning architecture.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of all weights in the model. This encourages smaller weights, making the model simpler and less prone to overfitting. It is called L2 because it uses the L2 norm (Euclidean distance) of the weights.

While not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, other popular regularization methods include L1 regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation. L1 regularization, like L2, adds a penalty term but uses the absolute value of the weights instead of their squares. Early stopping involves monitoring the model's performance on a separate validation set during training and halting the process once the validation error starts increasing. Data augmentation generates additional training samples by applying transformations such as rotations, translations, or flips to existing examples, helping the model generalize better.
