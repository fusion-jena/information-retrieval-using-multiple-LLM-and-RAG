The text does not provide information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the CNNs were trained using the TensorFlow backend on a Tesla M100 GPU. It also describes the use of data augmentation techniques such as rotation, reflectance bias, and random noise to enhance sample variation during training. Additionally, the schematic of the CNN used in the study shows an input image size of 32x32 pixels, which suggests that the dataset may have been preprocessed to fit this size requirement. Unfortunately, without more specific details about the dataset(s), it is impossible to definitively identify them.
