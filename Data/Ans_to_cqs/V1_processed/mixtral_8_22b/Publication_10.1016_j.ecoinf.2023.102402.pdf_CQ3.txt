Based on the given context, it is not possible to determine the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context does mention various sources of data collection methods such as citizen science surveys, social media, diving centers, fishing events, and questionnaires. However, there is no explicit mention of any particular data annotation technique like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based solely on the given context.
