Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention or reference to the specific location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in these studies. Therefore, it cannot be determined where the code repository is available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket) based solely on this information. It would require further research or access to more detailed documentation related to each study to find out about their respective code repositories.
