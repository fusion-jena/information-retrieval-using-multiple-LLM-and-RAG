The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the given context is for the automated detection and classification of bird vocalizations from sound recordings. This model, known as BirdNET, was developed as part of a research project between The Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the Chemnitz University of Technology. It uses a deep neural network to facilitate the identification of over 3000 bird species. Therefore, the primary function of this deep learning model is both classification and detection of bird species based on their vocalizations.
