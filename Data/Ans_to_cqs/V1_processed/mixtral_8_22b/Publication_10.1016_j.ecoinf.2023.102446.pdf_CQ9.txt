The information regarding the specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline data is stored is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, it does state that the half-hour temporal resolution flux tower data used in this study is available with Dr. Sandipan Mukherjee and the competent authorities of G.B. Pant National Institute of Himalayan Environment, Almora, Uttarakhand, India. Therefore, one might infer that the deep learning pipeline data could also be obtained by contacting these individuals or institutions. Unfortunately, without more specific details, I cannot provide a definitive answer as to whether the data is available through repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
