The given context does not provide explicit information on how the authors handled randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, based on common practices in machine learning research, there are several ways to manage randomness in deep learning pipelines. One approach is setting a fixed random seed value before running any code involving random processes like data shuffling or weight initialization. This ensures consistency across experiments and allows for reproducibility. Another strategy involves performing multiple runs with different random seeds and averaging results to reduce variance caused by randomness. Lastly, some researchers may choose to report results over multiple runs instead of a single run to account for variability due to randomness.
