The provided context does not explicitly mention which specific cloud platform or deployment environment was used to host the Pl@ntNet classification tool. However, it mentions that access to the tool is provided through a dedicated API available at <https://my.plantnet.org>. This suggests that the application may be hosted on a custom server or a private cloud solution rather than a public cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. Additionally, the text states that the training of Pl@ntNet's Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) required mobilizing a high-performance computing infrastructure, indicating that significant computational resources were involved in developing the model. Unfortunately, without further details about the hosting environment, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the exact platform used to deploy the deep learning model.
