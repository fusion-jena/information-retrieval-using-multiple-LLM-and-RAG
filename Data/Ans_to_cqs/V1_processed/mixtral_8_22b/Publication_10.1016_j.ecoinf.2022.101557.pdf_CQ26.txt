Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection being employed to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, one technique that can help mitigate potential biases is the use of random sampling when selecting validation sets. As stated in the context, samples are selected randomly from all areas used in the training set and are never used to fit the model. This approach helps ensure that the validation set remains representative of the overall dataset, reducing the risk of introducing bias through manual selection processes. Additionally, dropout regularization is applied during training to improve stability and prevent overfitting, which could potentially exacerbate existing biases within the dataset. While these techniques do not directly target data bias, they contribute to maintaining the integrity and fairness of the deep learning pipeline by promoting unbiased evaluation and generalizability.
