The authors monitored the model performance during training by considering two factors: 1) correct identification rate and 2) processing time. They trained their models for Mexican and Brazilian species using different numbers of training steps and observed how these factors changed with increasing training steps. For the Mexican dataset, they found that the correct identification rate improved up to a certain point before reaching a plateau, while processing time increased linearly with the number of training steps. By analyzing these trends, they determined that 2,000 training steps were optimal for achieving an 83.0% overall identification rate without excessively long processing times. Similarly, for the Brazilian dataset, they identified 12,000 training steps as optimal based on the tradeoff between correct identification rate and processing time. This approach allowed them to balance accuracy and efficiency when monitoring the model performance during training.
