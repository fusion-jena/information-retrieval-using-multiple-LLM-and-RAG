The text does not provide explicit information about which specific deep learning framework was used to build the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the study uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based models, specifically Inception v.3. Both TensorFlow and PyTorch support Inception v.3 architecture, so either could potentially be used. Without further context or information, it is impossible to determine which one was actually employed.
