The text does not provide explicit information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning models mentioned, such as learning rate, optimizer, batch size, etc. However, it does mention the use of various pre-trained deep learning architectures like AlexNet, ResNet-50, VGG-19, GoogleNet, and Inceptionv3. These models have their own default hyperparameter settings, which can be adjusted based on the requirements of the task. For instance, the learning rate, optimizer, and other hyperparameters can be fine-tuned during training to improve the model's performance. Unfortunately, without additional context, I cannot provide more detailed information regarding the exact hyperparameters used in these models.
