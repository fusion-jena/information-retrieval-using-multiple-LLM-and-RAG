In the given context, the method utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is through the use of a fixed camera called KaKaXi. This camera captures images every hour within a fixed period of time each day, and these images are saved in a database. The process of creating a dataset from scratch and annotating it for custom training is also mentioned. However, no specific details about the use of surveys, sensors, or public datasets are provided in the given context. Therefore, based on the information available, we can only infer that one possible method for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is through the use of cameras such as KaKaXi.
