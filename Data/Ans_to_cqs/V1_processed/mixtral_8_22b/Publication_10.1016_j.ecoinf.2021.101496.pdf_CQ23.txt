The text does not explicitly mention specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it is mentioned that the evaluation was performed on "test dataset" records for all three modeling approaches, which suggests some form of validation process. Additionally, the fact that the artificial neural network was fitted using the Keras package in Python implies that standard practices for training and validating deep learning models may have been followed. Nonetheless, without explicit information about these practices, we cannot definitively state what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
