Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved to ensure that the input data is suitable for the model. These steps may include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing or handling missing values, outliers, and irrelevant features in the dataset. It ensures that the model does not learn from incorrect or misleading information.

2. Normalization/Standardization: This step scales the input features so that they fall within a specific range, usually between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. Scaling helps prevent certain features from dominating others due to their larger magnitudes, ensuring that all features contribute equally during training.

3. Feature Engineering: This process involves creating new features from existing ones to help improve the performance of the model. For example, polynomial features can be created from numerical variables to capture nonlinear relationships.

4. Encoding Categorical Variables: Since neural networks only accept numeric inputs, categorical variables need to be converted into numerical form using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

5. Data Augmentation: To increase the size of the dataset and introduce more variability, synthetic samples can be generated through transformations like rotation, flipping, zooming, etc. This technique is particularly useful when working with image datasets.

6. Splitting Dataset: Before training the model, the dataset needs to be divided into three subsets: training, validation, and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is employed to tune hyperparameters and select models, while the test set evaluates the final model's performance.
