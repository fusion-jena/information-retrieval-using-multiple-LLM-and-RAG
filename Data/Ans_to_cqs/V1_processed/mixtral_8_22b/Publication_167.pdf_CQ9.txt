The given context does not provide any explicit information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it mentions that the training set consists of grids with neighborhood features from six years (1986, 2005, 2008, 2010, and 2013), including the LU type, soil, topography, elevation, slope, aspect, distance to settlements, distance to roads, distance to rivers in this grid unit, and the four neighborhood grid units. This suggests that the authors may have used their own dataset for training the deep learning model. Therefore, without additional information, I am unable to provide the exact location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline.
