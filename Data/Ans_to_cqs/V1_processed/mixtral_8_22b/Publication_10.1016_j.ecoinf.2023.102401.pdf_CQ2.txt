Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily utilizes image data. Specifically, several datasets mentioned in the text contain images for training and testing purposes. For instance, the first dataset has 638 images divided into seven categories, with 510 images for training and 128 for testing. Similarly, the trash-ICRA19 dataset includes 1144 images across three categories, with 915 images for training and 229 for testing. Other datasets such as VisDrone, NWPU VHR-10, and HRSID also use image data. Therefore, based on this information, it can be concluded that the deep learning pipeline discussed here mainly deals with image data. However, without explicit mention of other data formats like audio or video, it cannot be confirmed if those formats are also used in this particular pipeline.
