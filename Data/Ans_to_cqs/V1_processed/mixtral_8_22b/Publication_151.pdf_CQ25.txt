The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is not explicitly stated as either classification, segmentation, or detection. Instead, it appears to be used for mapping a given query sequence to a vector of distances. This is done by computing two sets of distances, with and without gap reconstruction, respectively. The final distances are then calculated as a weighted sum of these distances, with the weights determined by the proportion of sites with gaps in the query sequences. Once the distances have been computed, the query is placed onto a phylogenetic tree using distance-based placement. The goal of this approach seems to be to accurately place new sequences onto an existing phylogenetic tree based on their genetic similarity to other sequences in the tree.
