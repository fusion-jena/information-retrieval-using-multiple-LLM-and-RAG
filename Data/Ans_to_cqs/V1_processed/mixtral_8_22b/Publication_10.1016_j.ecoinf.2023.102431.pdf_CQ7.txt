The table titled "Table 1 Sample sizes for training, test, and validation groups for discriminant analysis" provides information about how the data was divided into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. In total, there were 167 samples for Marten Tracks and 367 samples for Fisher Tracks. Each subset has its own purpose in building and evaluating the performance of the deep learning models. The training set is used to fit the parameters of the model, while the validation set is used to tune the hyperparameters of the model. Finally, the test set is used to assess the final performance of the fully trained model.
