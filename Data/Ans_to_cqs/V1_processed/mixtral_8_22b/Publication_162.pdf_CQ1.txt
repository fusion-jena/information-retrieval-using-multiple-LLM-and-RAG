The paper does not provide specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in their deep learning pipeline. However, some clues can be found in the references cited within the text. For instance, reference number 5 discusses a new LED lamp for collecting nocturnal lepidoptera, which suggests that the authors may have used this method or similar ones to collect data. Additionally, reference number 6 mentions augmenting fine-grained datasets with selected internet images, indicating that the authors might have used publicly available datasets to supplement their own collected data. Lastly, reference number 33 describes a large-scale species classification and detection dataset called iNaturalist, which could potentially be another source of data for the authors. Overall, while the exact methods used for collecting raw data are not explicitly stated in the given context, these references suggest that the authors likely employed a combination of custom data collection techniques and publicly available datasets.
