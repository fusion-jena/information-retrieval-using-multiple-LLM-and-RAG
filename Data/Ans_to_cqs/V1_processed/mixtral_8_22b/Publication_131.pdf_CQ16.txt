The text does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed for the given models. However, it mentions that the first CNN model was trained using five epochs, while the second network was trained using six epochs. This suggests that the number of epochs might have been used as a criterion to stop the training process. Additionally, the use of the term 'best training' implies that some form of evaluation or metric was employed to assess the performance of the models during training. Common criteria used to determine when training is complete include monitoring metrics such as validation loss, accuracy, or other performance indicators, and stopping the training process once these metrics reach a satisfactory level or start to plateau.
