The study by P.A. Kowalski et al. utilizes various sources for collecting raw data in their deep learning pipeline. For instance, they use data from the Central Statistical Office (GUS) such as the percentage of the population employed in industry (INDST), which serves as an indicator of the potential impact of industrial workplaces on disease outbreaks. Additionally, they employ data from OpenStreetMap like the distance from land border crossings (BOR), which helps determine the 'internationalization' of a particular district and reveals the likelihood of contact with infected individuals from other countries. Furthermore, they gather information about access to medical assistance (DOC) from GUS, representing the availability of local medical services through the number of doctors per 100,000 residents. Although not explicitly mentioned, these data collection methods suggest the use of publicly accessible datasets and possibly surveys or sensor data to obtain relevant information for their research.
