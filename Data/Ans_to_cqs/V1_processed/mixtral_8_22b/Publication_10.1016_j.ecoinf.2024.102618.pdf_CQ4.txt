The paper by Shijie et al. (2017) applies several data augmentation techniques to enhance the diversity of their Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model. These techniques include Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), flipping, cropping, shifting, Principal Components Analysis (PCA), color, noise, and rotation. Among these, cropping, flipping, GANs, and rotation were found to have superior performance compared to the others. Furthermore, combining multiple augmentation techniques was observed to yield significant advantages over employing individual methods alone.

In another study, Tiwari et al. (2021) developed a new dataset and tested new data augmentation algorithms. Although specific details about the employed augmentation techniques are not mentioned, they likely included common methods such as flipping, rotating, scaling, and translating images.

Additionally, Shrivastava and Pradhan (2021) utilized color features for rice plant disease classification using machine learning approaches. While not explicitly stated, it is plausible that their methodology involved some form of color manipulation as part of their data augmentation process.

Lastly, Tan and Le (2019) introduced EfficientNet, which achieved high accuracy among various deep learning models. Their approach incorporated a complex data augmentation technique to expand the number of images from 55,448 to 61,486. Unfortunately, the exact nature of this augmentation technique remains unspecified within the given context.

In summary, the discussed papers apply numerous data augmentation techniques, including but not limited to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), flipping, cropping, shifting, Principal Components Analysis (PCA), color, noise, and rotation. Some studies also mention utilizing complex or novel augmentation methods; however, further information regarding these techniques is not available within the provided context.
