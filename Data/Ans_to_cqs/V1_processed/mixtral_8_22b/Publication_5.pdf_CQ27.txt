After training the deep learning model for approximately 5000 iterations using a NVIDIA Titan X GPU, the model was developed using TensorFlow, an end-to-end open source platform for deep learning. However, the text does not provide explicit information about the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. It only mentions that TensorFlow was used to develop the species richness estimation model.
