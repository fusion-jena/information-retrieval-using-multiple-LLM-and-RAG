The given information does not provide details about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It discusses the use of YOLOv4 and EfficientNet for re-identifying candidate regions and mentions the use of data augmentation techniques. However, it does not specify any specific data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, without additional information, it is impossible to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
