Based on the given context, we can infer that images are used in the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, the context discusses the application of deep learning in image recognition, focusing on the CNN architecture called AlexNet. This architecture was used to win the 2012 ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge. Therefore, it can be concluded that one of the data formats used in this deep learning pipeline is images. However, the context does not provide information about other possible data formats such as audio, video, or CSV files.
