The text does not provide specific information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It discusses various aspects of image classification, including the use of machine learning tools, the limitations of machine learning methods, and potential improvements for mixed-methods analytical historical ecology. However, it does not mention any specific repositories like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based on the given context.
