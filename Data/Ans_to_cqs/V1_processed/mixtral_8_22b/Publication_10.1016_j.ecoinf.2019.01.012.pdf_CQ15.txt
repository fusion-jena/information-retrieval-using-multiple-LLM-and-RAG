The text mentions that the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was trained using the Adaptive Moment Estimation (ADAM) optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001. ADAM is a popular optimization algorithm used in deep learning pipelines, known for its efficiency and low memory requirements. It combines the advantages of two other optimization algorithms, RMSprop and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with momentum, resulting in an optimization technique that can converge quickly while being computationally efficient. Other optimization techniques mentioned in the references include SGD without momentum and RMSprop, but these were not explicitly stated as being used in this particular deep learning pipeline.
