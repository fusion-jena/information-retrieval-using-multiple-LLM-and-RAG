Based on the given context, it appears that a deep learning model was constructed using H2O in R. However, the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline, such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer, is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. Therefore, without additional information, we cannot determine which type of deep learning model was employed in this study.
