The given context does not provide explicit information about specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning before training the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that some preprocessing steps might have taken place based on the overall process described.

Firstly, the raw audio data is converted into spectrogram images, which could be considered a type of preprocessing step. These spectrogram images are then fed into the ResNet-50 deep convolutional neural network. Before being inputted into the network, it is likely that the images underwent standard image processing techniques like resizing or cropping to fit the required dimensions of the network.

Additionally, the text mentions that the ResNet-50 network was pre-trained using millions of labeled images in over 1000 categories. This implies that the network had already gone through a significant amount of preprocessing and training before being used in this particular study.

However, without more detailed information about the exact preprocessing steps performed on the data before feeding it into the deep learning model, it is difficult to provide a comprehensive list of preprocessing steps involved in this case.
