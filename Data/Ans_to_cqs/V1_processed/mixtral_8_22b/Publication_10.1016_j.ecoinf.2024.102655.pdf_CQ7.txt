The given context does not provide explicit details on the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into sets such as train, test, or validation. However, it does mention some general considerations when working with water quality datasets for machine learning models.

The text suggests that using too much data can lead to model overtraining and precision loss. This implies that the amount of data used for training should be carefully considered to avoid this issue. Furthermore, the context mentions that water quality datasets often contain redundant information, which could potentially affect the performance of the model if included in the training set. Therefore, one possible criterion for splitting the data might involve removing or reducing redundant features before dividing the dataset.

Additionally, the context emphasizes the importance of analyzing historical trends in water quality to identify the most variable and representative scenarios for machine learning model training. This indicates that another potential criterion for splitting the data could involve selecting samples based on their representativeness and variability within the dataset. By doing so, the resulting subsets would better capture the overall characteristics of the data, leading to improved predictive outputs.

In summary, while the given context does not explicitly state the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it provides insights into some factors that should be taken into account during this process. These include considering the amount of data used for training, handling redundant information, and selecting representative and variable samples for each subset.
