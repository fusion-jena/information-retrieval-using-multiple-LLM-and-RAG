The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using the IKHO algorithm. This algorithm is a swarm intelligence-based approach inspired by the swarming behavior of krills. It integrates the Krill Herd (KH) algorithm with a free search (FS) operator to overcome the local optimum problem often encountered in the KH algorithm. By applying this algorithm, the authors aim to improve the performance of their proposed PTDLEN-VAE model when dealing with unseen data.
