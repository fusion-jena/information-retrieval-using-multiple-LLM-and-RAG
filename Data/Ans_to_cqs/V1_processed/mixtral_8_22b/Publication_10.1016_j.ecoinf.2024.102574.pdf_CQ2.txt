Based on the given context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily uses image data. Specifically, the context mentions the use of high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) such as Digital Surface Models (DSMs), Digital Terrain Models (DTMs), and Digital Orthophoto Models (DOMs) derived from Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry. These models are essentially raster or grid-based representations of terrain elevations and surface features, which can be considered as image data. Additionally, the context refers to the use of the Image Classification tool in ArcMap 10.7, further suggesting the involvement of image data in the deep learning process. However, without explicit mention of other data formats like audio, video, or CSV files, it cannot be confirmed if they are part of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, based on the available information, we can conclude that the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is image data.
