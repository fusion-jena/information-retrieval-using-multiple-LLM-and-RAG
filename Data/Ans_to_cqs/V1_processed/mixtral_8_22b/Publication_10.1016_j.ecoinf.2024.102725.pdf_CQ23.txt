The given context does not provide explicit information on the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model used in the study. However, it can be inferred that the researchers may have used diverse datasets, such as those from the Danjiang River Basin, to train their model. This would help improve its ability to predict NDVI reconstructions accurately across different environments. Additionally, techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting might have been applied during the training process to further enhance the model's performance and prevent overfitting. Nevertheless, without more detailed information about the methods section, we cannot confirm which specific strategies were implemented to guarantee the generalizability of the deep learning model.
