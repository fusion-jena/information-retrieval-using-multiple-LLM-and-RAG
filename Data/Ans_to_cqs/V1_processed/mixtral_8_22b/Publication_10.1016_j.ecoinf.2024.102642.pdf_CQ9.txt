The information regarding the availability of the deep learning pipeline's data repository is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide specific details about its location on platforms such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. However, the context does mention that the study uses 7 hours of audio signals recorded during the OHASISBIO program, which were collected at the SWAMS site in the Indian Ocean's oceanic zone between Kerguelen and Amsterdam Island. Additionally, the study mentions that only a small portion of these datasets were used due to computational constraints.
