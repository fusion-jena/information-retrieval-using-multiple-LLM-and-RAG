Unfortunately, there isn't any specific information about the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline within the given context. Data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, etc., are commonly used in image processing tasks to increase the size of training sets by creating modified versions of images from existing ones. However, since the context focuses on predicting dissolved oxygen concentrations in water rather than image processing, these specific techniques might not apply directly. Instead, other forms of data preprocessing and manipulation could have been employed, such as normalizing numerical values, encoding categorical features, or applying feature engineering techniques. Without further details, it's impossible to provide a definitive list of data augmentation techniques used in this particular scenario.
