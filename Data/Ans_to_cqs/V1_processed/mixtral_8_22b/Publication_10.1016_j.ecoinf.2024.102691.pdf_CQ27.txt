Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available in the given context to provide a detailed explanation about how the trained deep learning model was deployed. However, generally speaking, once a deep learning model has been trained, it can be saved or serialized into a file format such as.h5,.onnx, or.pb depending upon the framework used for development. After saving the model, it can then be loaded onto different platforms like TensorFlow Serving, AWS Sagemaker, Google Cloud AI Platform, etc., where it can be utilized for making predictions on new data.
