The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the given information, we can infer that some form of visual data such as images or videos are utilized. For instance, the text mentions "features from images" and discusses methods like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which are typically applied to image data. Furthermore, there is reference to detecting mammals in UAV images and actions in wildlife videos, suggesting the use of visual data. Therefore, while the exact format isn't specified, it appears that image or video data is likely being employed within this deep learning pipeline.
