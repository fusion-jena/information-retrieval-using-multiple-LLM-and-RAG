The given context does not explicitly mention where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it mentions that the dataset used in the research was obtained from the Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency. Therefore, one could infer that the data might be available through their website or upon request. Unfortunately, without more specific information, it cannot be determined if the data is also available on platforms such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
