Based on the given information, there is no mention of any specific deep learning models being used in the pipeline. The text discusses data filtering, retrieval, and scaling using Google Earth Engine (GEE), but does not provide details about the use of deep learning models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), or transformer models. Therefore, without additional context, we cannot determine what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline.
