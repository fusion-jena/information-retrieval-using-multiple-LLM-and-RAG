The purpose of the deep learning model in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred that the model is being used for species distribution modeling based on bioclimatic variables. The authors mention using a convolutional neural network to model the distribution of species at a fine resolution, suggesting that the model might be used for classification or prediction tasks related to species distribution. It's worth noting that other studies have used deep learning models for visualizing results, while this particular study uses UMAP for both visualization and quantifying a similarity gradient among species and background classes. Therefore, without further information, it cannot be definitively determined whether the deep learning model serves a specific purpose like classification, segmentation, or detection.
