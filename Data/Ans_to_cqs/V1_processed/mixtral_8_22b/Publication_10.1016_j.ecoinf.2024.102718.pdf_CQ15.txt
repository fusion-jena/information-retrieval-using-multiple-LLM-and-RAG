Unfortunately, there isn't any explicit information about specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline within the given context. However, it can be generally assumed that popular optimization algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), or Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp) could have been employed due to their widespread use in deep learning applications. These methods help minimize loss function during the training process, enabling the model to learn more efficiently. Nonetheless, without further details regarding the implementation of the BEiT model or other mentioned models, we cannot definitively state which optimization technique was utilized.
