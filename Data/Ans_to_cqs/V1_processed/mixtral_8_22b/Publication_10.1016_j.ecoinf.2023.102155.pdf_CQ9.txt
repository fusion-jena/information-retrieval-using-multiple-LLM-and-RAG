I am sorry, but I cannot find any specific information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available from the given context. It does not mention any specific data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide an accurate answer to your query.
