Deep learning leverages neural networks to solve complex problems by utilizing various types of input data. This includes but is not limited to images, audio, video, and structured data such as CSV files. For instance, deep learning has made significant strides in areas like machine translation using textual data, speech recognition employing audio data, and computer vision utilizing image or video data. Specifically, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) have been extensively applied for image processing tasks. Moreover, the mentioned studies demonstrate the use of camera trap images for ecological information extraction. However, while these examples highlight specific data formats, it should be noted that deep learning can accommodate a wide array of data formats depending on the problem being addressed.
