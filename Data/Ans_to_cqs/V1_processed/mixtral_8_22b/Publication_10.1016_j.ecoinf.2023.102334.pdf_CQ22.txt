The authors of the paper employ various metrics to evaluate the performance of their deep learning model. These include accuracy, precision, and other evaluation indicators. To calculate these metrics, they utilize a confusion matrix, which provides a visual representation of the model's performance across different categories. The values along the main diagonal of the matrix indicate the proportion of correctly predicted samples for each class, while the off-diagonal elements signify misclassifications or false positives/negatives. By analyzing the confusion matrix, one can quickly determine the strengths and weaknesses of the model and identify areas for potential improvement.
