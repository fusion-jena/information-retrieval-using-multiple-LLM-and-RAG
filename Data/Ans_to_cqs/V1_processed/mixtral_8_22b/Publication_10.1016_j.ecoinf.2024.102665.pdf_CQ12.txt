Based on the given context, there isn't enough information to determine the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. While the paper by Do and Tran mentions using a deep learning model combined with an optimization algorithm to detect the dispersal of the early stages of spotted butterfish in northern Vietnam under global warming, it does not specify which type of deep learning model was employed. Therefore, without further details or access to the original research papers, we cannot definitively state whether they used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Transformer, or another type of deep learning model.
