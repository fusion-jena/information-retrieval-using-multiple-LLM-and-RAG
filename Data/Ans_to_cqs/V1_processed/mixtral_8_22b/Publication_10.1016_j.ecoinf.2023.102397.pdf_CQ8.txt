Unfortunately, there is no information provided about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The given context only mentions that ARBIMON is linked to the Rainforest Connection website and uses a random forest model, but it does not provide any details regarding the location of the code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
