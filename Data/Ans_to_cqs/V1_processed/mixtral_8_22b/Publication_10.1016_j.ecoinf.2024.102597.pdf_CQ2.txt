The text does not provide explicit information about the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that researchers have developed numerous Water Quality Parameters (WQP) inversion algorithms using different approaches, including deep learning algorithms. The study considers the development of these algorithms, but it does not specify the type of input data used in the deep learning models.

Additionally, the text discusses the application of machine learning methods to estimate WQP, mentioning examples like Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Neural Networks (NN). It also refers to ensemble learning as a key technology in the field. However, there is no clear indication of the data format used in these models either.

Based on the given context, we can infer that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline could potentially involve satellite imagery or remote sensing data, considering the focus on estimating WQP. This assumption is further supported by the mention of sensors like the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and Landsat satellites being used for similar purposes. Nevertheless, without more specific details from the provided context, we cannot definitively determine the exact data format used in the deep learning pipeline.
