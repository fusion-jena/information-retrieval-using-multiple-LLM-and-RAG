The given context does not contain any information about specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotation, or scaling. These techniques are commonly used to increase the amount of training data by creating modified versions of existing images or datasets, which helps improve the performance and generalization of machine learning models. However, without explicit mention in the provided sources, it is impossible to identify the exact data augmentation techniques employed in this case.
