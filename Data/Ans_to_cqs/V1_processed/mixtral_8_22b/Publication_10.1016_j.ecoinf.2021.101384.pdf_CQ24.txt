The given context does not provide any specific details about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline using strategies such as setting a fixed random seed value. However, generally speaking, one common strategy to manage randomness in machine learning models, including deep learning pipelines, is to set a fixed random seed value. By doing so, we ensure that the results obtained from running the model multiple times will be reproducible since the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers will be generated every time. Another strategy could involve using techniques like cross-validation or bootstrapping to estimate the variability introduced by randomness in the dataset or model initialization.
