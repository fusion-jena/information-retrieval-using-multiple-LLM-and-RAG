The provided context does not directly address the query about regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide some information regarding this topic. Regularization methods are techniques used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models, including deep learning pipelines. Two common regularization methods mentioned in the query are dropout and L2 regularization. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps reduce overdependence on any single feature and prevents overfitting. On the other hand, L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, encouraging smaller weights and preventing overfitting due to large weight values. Other regularization methods include L1 regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation. In summary, while the provided context does not discuss these methods specifically, they are important tools for preventing overfitting in deep learning pipelines.
