The text mentions that various deep learning networks have been employed in constructing the pipeline, including Faster R-CNN (Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network) (Ren et al., 2017). Additionally, some methods use Fully Convolutional Regression Network (FCRN) (Xie et al., 2016) as inspiration. These examples suggest that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are primarily utilized in the pipeline. However, the specific architecture may vary depending on the approach taken, as evidenced by the mention of multiple strategies and architectures.
