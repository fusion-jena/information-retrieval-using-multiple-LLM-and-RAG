The text does not provide explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps used after model training. However, it can be inferred that some common postprocessing steps might have been employed given the nature of the study. These could include metrics calculation such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score to evaluate the performance of the models. Additionally, confusion matrices might have been generated to visualize the performance of the classifiers. The study also mentions the use of hyperparameter optimization techniques like random grid search and Bayesian optimization, suggesting that cross-validation might have been used during this process. Lastly, since the study focuses on tracking changes in chlorophyll-a concentration and turbidity, saliency maps might have been utilized to understand the importance of different features in predicting these variables.
