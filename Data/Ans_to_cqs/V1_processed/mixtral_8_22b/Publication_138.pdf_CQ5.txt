Unfortunately, there is no explicit information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context. However, based on common practices in deep learning research, some possible datasets could include popular ones such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. These datasets are widely used for various tasks like image classification, object detection, and segmentation. For instance, MNIST is commonly used for handwritten digit recognition, while CIFAR contains small natural images suitable for computer vision tasks. On the other hand, ImageNet is a vast dataset containing millions of labeled images across thousands of categories, making it ideal for training complex models like those discussed in the context. Nevertheless, without further details, it cannot be confirmed if these datasets were indeed used in the described deep learning pipeline.
