The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it mentions that the SGRU model outperformed several statistical and machine learning models, including another deep learning model called SLSTM, in terms of predictive performance. Additionally, the SGRU model demonstrated significantly higher accuracy in predicting CO concentrations compared to other models. These comparisons suggest that the SGRU model has been tested against various benchmarks, contributing to its robustness and potential generalizability. Nevertheless, without further details regarding the validation process, it remains unclear whether additional steps were taken to enhance the model's generalizability.
