Unfortunately, there is no explicit mention of the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model in the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding whether GPUs or TPUs were utilized during the training process. It would require more detailed information about the implementation of the deep learning model to determine which hardware resources were employed.
