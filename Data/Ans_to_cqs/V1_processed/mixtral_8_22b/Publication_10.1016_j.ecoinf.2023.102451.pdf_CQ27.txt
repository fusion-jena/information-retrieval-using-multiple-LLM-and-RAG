The text does not provide information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. It only mentions details related to the development environment, programming language, input dataset, loss function, activation function, learning rate, epochs, and optimizer used during the training phase. However, it does not discuss any steps taken for model serialization or platform selection for deployment purposes. Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot determine what process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
