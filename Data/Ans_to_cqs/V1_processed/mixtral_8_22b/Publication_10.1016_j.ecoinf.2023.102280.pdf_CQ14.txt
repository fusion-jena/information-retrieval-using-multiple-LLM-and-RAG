The paper does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, it mentions that both methods used in the study are manually tuned to maximize the evaluation metrics. This suggests that some form of manual or iterative optimization process was employed, such as grid search or random search, although the specific method is not mentioned.
