In this study, the criterion used to determine when training is complete is identifying the best training epoch for the CNN model. This is done by using one of the four training folds as a validation set and training on the remaining three folds. The parameter setting (epoch) achieving the highest classification accuracy on the validation set is then selected as the best training epoch. Therefore, the completion of training is determined by reaching the highest classification accuracy on the validation set during the training process.
