To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, it was recommended to reserve monitoring areas for creating validation and test sets. These areas would avoid any link with the training data, which would help estimate the correct generalization of the model. By doing so, the authors suggest that this could expedite threshold calibration during production. Additionally, the use of deep learning allows for a large number of classes and benefits from numerous and diverse data, further contributing to the model's ability to generalize well. However, the specific details regarding the implementation of cross-validation or stratified splitting are not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
