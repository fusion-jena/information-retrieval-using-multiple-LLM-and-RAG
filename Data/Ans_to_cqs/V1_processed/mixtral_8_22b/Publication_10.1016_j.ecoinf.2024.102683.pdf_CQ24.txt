The given context does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, we can infer that the proposed approach employs certain strategies to address variability and improve the overall performance of the deep learning model.

Firstly, the data is divided into five equal folds, which could help reduce the impact of any inherent biases or noise present in the dataset. By processing each fold separately, the model can learn from diverse subsets of the data, potentially leading to improved generalization capabilities.

Secondly, the use of a Bayesian optimizer suggests that the model incorporates probabilistic reasoning to manage uncertainty and randomness. Bayesian optimization is a sequential design strategy for global optimization of black-box functions that doesn't require derivatives. It works by constructing a posterior distribution of functions (Gaussian Process) that best describes the function you want to optimize. This allows the model to make informed decisions regarding hyperparameter tuning and policy selection, even in the presence of randomness.

Lastly, the implementation of attention mechanisms further enhances the model's ability to focus on relevant input elements, thereby reducing the influence of irrelevant or noisy features. Attention mechanisms enable the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input data, effectively mitigating the effects of randomness and improving overall performance.
