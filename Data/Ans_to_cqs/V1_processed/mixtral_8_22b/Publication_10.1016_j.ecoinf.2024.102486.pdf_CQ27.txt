The provided context does not contain specific information about the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. However, it mentions several popular libraries and frameworks used for developing and training deep learning models, including TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and others like the Deep Learning Toolbox by MathWorks, cuDNN, and Darknet. These tools often provide functionalities for saving and loading models, which can be useful during the deployment stage. For instance, TensorFlow has built-in functions for saving and restoring models, while PyTorch provides methods for saving and loading entire models or individual components. As for platform selection, the choice depends on various factors such as hardware requirements, scalability needs, and integration with other systems. Some platforms commonly used for deploying deep learning models include cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, as well as edge devices for real-time processing.
