Unfortunately, there is no information available regarding the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model such as learning rate or optimizer. The given context primarily discusses the PLUS model, which is not explicitly stated to be a deep learning model. Furthermore, it focuses on the components of the PLUS model, including the LEAS module and the CA model based on the CARS mechanism. It also mentions the application of the random forest algorithm within the LEAS module but does not provide any details about specific hyperparameters related to a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information based on the given context.
