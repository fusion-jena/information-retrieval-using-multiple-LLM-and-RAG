Unfortunately, the given context does not provide explicit information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the training set is pre-processed using a MinMaxScaler that transforms each feature by scaling it to a [0â€“1] range. This suggests that the dataset could contain numerical data related to air quality measurements or similar. Additionally, the text refers to a study conducted in Casarotti (2021), which may include more details about the datasets used. Nevertheless, without further context or access to the mentioned sources, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the exact datasets employed in the deep learning pipeline.
