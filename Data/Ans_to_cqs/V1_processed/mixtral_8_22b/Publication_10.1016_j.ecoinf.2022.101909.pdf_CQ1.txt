Based on the given context, it appears that the researchers used a labeled dataset containing audio recordings of birds. However, the specific details about how this dataset was collected are not explicitly mentioned. It is possible that they used publicly available datasets like Audio Set or VGG-Sound, but there is no direct confirmation of this. Additionally, the use of mobile applications like BirdNet for gathering data is also suggested, but again, there is no explicit mention of its usage in this research. Therefore, while it seems likely that the researchers used some form of audio recording devices or existing datasets, the exact methods employed for collecting raw data remain uncertain based solely on the provided information.
