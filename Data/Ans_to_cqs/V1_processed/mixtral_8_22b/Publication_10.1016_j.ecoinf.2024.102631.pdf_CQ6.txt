Based on the given context, it appears that there isn't explicit mention of specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning prior to training the deep learning model. However, some aspects of data preparation can be inferred from the description of the network architecture and its components.

For instance, the network accepts images with dimensions of 256 x 256 pixels and three color channels as input. This implies that the images have been resized and possibly converted to a standard format (RGB). Additionally, the use of Batch Normalization after each convolution layer suggests that the input data has undergone some form of normalization during the training process.

Furthermore, the presence of Leaky-ReLU activation functions indicates that the network handles negative values appropriately, implying that no additional processing might be required to address potential issues related to negative pixel intensities.

However, without more specific information about the dataset and any preprocessing steps applied to it, one cannot definitively state what exact preprocessing techniques were employed before training the deep learning model.
