Based on the given context, it appears that the performance of the machine learning models was monitored using several evaluation metrics such as coefficient of determination (R2), NSE (Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970), Klingâ€“Gupta efficiency (KGE) (Gupta et al., 2009), and correlation coefficient (COR) (Sardoei et al., 2024). These metrics are used to assess the quality of predictions made by the models during the training phase.

In Table 5, we can see that the performance statistics for the training dataset include NSE, COR, KGE, and R2 for both Random Forest (RF) and Classification and Regression Trees (CART) models. This suggests that these metrics were employed to evaluate the performance of the models during training. However, the context does not provide explicit details regarding the specific strategy or methodology used to implement these metrics for monitoring model performance during training. Therefore, I cannot provide a more detailed explanation of the exact strategy used for monitoring model performance during training.
