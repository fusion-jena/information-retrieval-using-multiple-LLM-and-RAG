The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics such as estimated weight, estimated efficiency per minute, identified accuracy percentage, and root mean square error (RMSE). Additionally, parameters like W ± STD (body weight ± standard deviation) and Mean Relative Error (MRE) are also used. For instance, the table shows that the estimated weights range from 457.82 ± 63.46 to 483.98 ± 108.09 grams, while the estimated efficiencies vary from 2.79 to 17.11 per minute. Furthermore, the identified accuracies range from 83.33% to 94.44%, indicating the effectiveness of the model. Lastly, the RMSE values range from 11.83 to 18.7 grams, and the MRE ranges from 2.15% to 4.14%. These metrics help assess the overall performance of the deep learning model.
