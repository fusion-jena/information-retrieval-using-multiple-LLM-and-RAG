The materials and methods section describes the use of standardization for pre-processing the data before applying it to the statistical models. However, there is no information about any specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, based on the given context, I do not know what postprocessing steps are involved after the model training.
