The text does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it can be inferred that the Mean Intersection over Union (IoU) score is used as a metric to evaluate the performance of the model. A threshold of >50% was considered as an indicator of excellent performance. Additionally, the text mentions that the iterative nature of model training is required to achieve performance suitable for one's specific needs, which suggests that the completion of training might depend on achieving satisfactory performance according to the user's requirements.
