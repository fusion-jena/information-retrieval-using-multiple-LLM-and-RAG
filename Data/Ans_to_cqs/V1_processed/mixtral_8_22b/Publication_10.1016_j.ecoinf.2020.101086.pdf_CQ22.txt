The text discusses a study comparing different methods for correcting sampling bias effects in species distribution modeling. Three indices are used to measure the relative impact of the correction methods on model performance: ΔAUCCx, ΔDenvCx, and ΔDgeoCx. These indices compare the performance of the corrected model to the original biased model and the ideal unbiased model. They range from negative infinity to 1, where a negative value means the biased model performed better, a positive value means the corrected model did better, and a score of 1 represents perfect correction.

However, the specific metrics mentioned in the query such as accuracy, precision, and recall are not explicitly discussed in the given context. Instead, the study uses Area Under Curve (AUC), environmental distance (Denv), and geographical distance (Dgeo) as performance indicators. Therefore, based on the provided information, we cannot directly state which traditional machine learning metrics like accuracy, precision, or recall are being used in this particular study.
