The given context does not provide any specific details about how the trained deep learning model was deployed. However, based on common practices in machine learning projects, once the model is trained, it can be serialized into a format like ONNX or saved as a checkpoint file. Then, depending on the application requirements, the model can be integrated into various platforms such as web applications, mobile apps, or edge devices. The platform selection depends on factors like computational resources, latency requirements, and security considerations. Unfortunately, without more specific information, I cannot provide a detailed description of the deployment process used in this case.
