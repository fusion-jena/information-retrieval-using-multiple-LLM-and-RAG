Unfortunately, there isn't any information available regarding the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into sets such as train, test, and validation. However, typically, datasets are divided randomly into these subsets, often with a larger portion allocated for training and smaller portions for testing and validation. The exact proportions may vary depending on factors like the size of the dataset and the complexity of the task.
