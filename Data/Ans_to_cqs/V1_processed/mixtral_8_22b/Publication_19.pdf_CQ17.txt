The text does not provide explicit information regarding the use of specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that stochastic gradient descent (SGD) was used as the optimizer for all four models, which can help reduce overfitting due to its inherent noise during optimization. Additionally, the table indicates that the models were evaluated based on their performance on a separate test set, which is another common method to detect and mitigate overfitting.
