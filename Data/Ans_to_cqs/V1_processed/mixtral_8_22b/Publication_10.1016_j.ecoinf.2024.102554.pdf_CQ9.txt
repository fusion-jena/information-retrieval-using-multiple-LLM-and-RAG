Unfortunately, based on the given information, there isn't any explicit mention of where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The text mentions a crawling tool developed to gather historical and near real-time data from different SRS products, but it does not specify where this data is stored or made accessible. It also discusses the use of NetCDF files sourced from either ESA or NASA, which include important parameters like reflectance, Aerosol Optical Thickness (Kd940), and Chlorophyll-a concentrations. However, no specific repositories are mentioned. Additionally, the text refers to a README.md file that might provide more operational details about the tools used, but again, it doesn't indicate where the actual data repository can be found. Therefore, without further context or information, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
