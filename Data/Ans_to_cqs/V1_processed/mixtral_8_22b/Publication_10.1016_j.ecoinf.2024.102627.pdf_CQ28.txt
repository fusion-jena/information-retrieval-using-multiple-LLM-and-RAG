The text does not provide explicit information about which specific cloud computing platform was used for deploying the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the computations were performed using the High Performance Computing (HPC) resources from GENCI-[CINES](http://www.cines.fr/) (Centre Informatique National de l’Enseignement Supérieur) under the allocation [2020-A0080911732](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.46290) made by Grand Equipement National De Calcul Intensif (GENCI). Therefore, we cannot determine if the deployment was done on platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform based solely on the given information.
