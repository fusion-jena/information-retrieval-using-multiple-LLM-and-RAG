The text does not provide explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of hyperspectral images (HSIs) for forest species classification tasks. Hyperspectral images can be collected using various remote sensing techniques, including satellite or airborne platforms equipped with specialized cameras or spectrometers. These devices capture detailed spectral signatures across numerous narrow bands, providing rich information for analysis. Additionally, the paper references several studies that utilize HSIs for classification tasks, which may involve publicly available datasets or custom collections depending on the research objectives. Therefore, while the exact methodology for gathering raw data isn't specified here, we can infer that remote sensing technologies play a crucial role in acquiring hyperspectral images for deep learning applications.
