The provided context does not discuss any specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Instead, it focuses on correcting the effect of sampling bias in species distribution modeling when dealing with a low number of presence data. Therefore, I cannot provide information regarding the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline based on this context.
