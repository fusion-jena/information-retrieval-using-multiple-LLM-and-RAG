The purpose of the deep learning model is for classification. The model is being developed to classify birds using both visual and acoustic data. The goal is to create a more comprehensive understanding of various habitats by combining image and audio analysis. The current version of the model uses a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architecture with backpropagation and the Adam optimizer. It aims to minimize overfitting through techniques like dropout regularization. The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, precision, and accuracy. Future plans include expanding the number of classes in the model and comparing it to other advanced network architectures like 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
