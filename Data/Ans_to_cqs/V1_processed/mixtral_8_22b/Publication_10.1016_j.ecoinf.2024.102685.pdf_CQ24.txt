The text does not provide information about specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it discusses the use of Random Forest, a machine learning method that combines decision trees and bootstrapping. Bootstrapping involves creating multiple subsets of the original dataset and building separate models for each subset, which can help manage randomness and improve model performance. Additionally, Random Forest uses randomly selected features at every split node, further introducing variability into the modeling process. These techniques may indirectly address some aspects of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
