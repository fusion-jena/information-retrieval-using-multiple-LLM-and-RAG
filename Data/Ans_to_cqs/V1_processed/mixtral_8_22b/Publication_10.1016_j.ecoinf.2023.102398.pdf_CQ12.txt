Although the paper does not explicitly mention the specific type of deep learning model used, we can infer that the authors use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) due to several clues throughout the text. Firstly, they discuss convolutional and dense layers, which are common components of CNN architectures. Secondly, they reference YOLOv5, an object detection algorithm known for its implementation using CNNs. Lastly, the authors describe the input image size, which is typically required when working with CNN models. Therefore, while not stated outright, it is highly likely that the authors employ a CNN-based deep learning model in their pipeline.
