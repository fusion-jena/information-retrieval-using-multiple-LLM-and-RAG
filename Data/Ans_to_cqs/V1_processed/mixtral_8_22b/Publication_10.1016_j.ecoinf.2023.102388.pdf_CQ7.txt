In the given context, the data is split into several parts for deep learning model training. These include the training dataset (Dtrain), the attack dataset (DS), and the attack test dataset (T).

The training dataset (Dtrain) is used to train the target model using the learning algorithm A. This dataset is not shared with the attack dataset (DS).

The attack dataset (DS) is used to train the attack model. It is completely separate from the training dataset (Dtrain) but consists of data points drawn from the same data distribution as the training samples in Dtrain.

The attack test dataset (T) is disjoint from both DS and Dtrain. It is composed of non-member individuals never seen before by DS and Dtrain. This dataset is used to test the performance of the attack model after its training is completed.

Additionally, there is mention of a target validation set and a target test set, although their specific roles are not explicitly defined in the context. However, based on common practices in machine learning, these sets could be used for validating hyperparameters and assessing the classification accuracy of the target model, respectively.

Therefore, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in this context seem to be based on the need to have separate datasets for training the target and attack models, as well as for testing their performances.
