While the given context does not directly address the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, I can provide some general insights based on common practices. Preprocessing steps often involve data cleaning, normalization, and augmentation. Data cleaning involves removing or correcting erroneous data points, such as missing values or outliers. Normalization scales the input data to a standard range, typically between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1, to improve convergence during training. Scaling adjusts the scale of the input data to prevent any single feature from dominating the others. Lastly, data augmentation generates new samples by applying transformations like rotation, flipping, or zooming to existing ones, helping to increase the size and diversity of the dataset.
