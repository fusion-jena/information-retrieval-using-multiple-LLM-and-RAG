The given context does not provide specific information about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge, some common techniques used to address data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and collecting diverse data.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets such that each subset maintains the original class proportions. Oversampling increases the number of instances in the minority class, while undersampling reduces the number of instances in the majority class. Collecting diverse data involves gathering data from various sources to ensure that the model is exposed to different types of examples.

In the context of transfer learning, the problem of data bias can arise due to differences between the source and target domains. To address this issue, techniques such as instance weighting, feature representation mapping, and domain adaptation methods like adversarial training can be employed. These techniques aim to reduce the discrepancies between the source and target domains, thereby improving the performance of the transferred models.
