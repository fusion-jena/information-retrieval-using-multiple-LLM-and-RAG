The text does not provide information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it mentions that documentation for the machine learning pipeline can be found at specific sources for each library or tool used in the pipeline, including PyTorch, scikit-learn, and skorch. Additionally, there is mention of commercial restrictions applying to the availability of data used in this work, but no explicit reference to any publicly accessible code repositories. Therefore, I do not know where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
