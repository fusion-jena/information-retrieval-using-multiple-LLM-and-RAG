The model accuracy was assessed after each full training set iteration (epoch), quantifying the proportion of correct class predictions out of the total predictions made. This suggests that the completion of training may have been determined based on the performance of the model on the validation set after each epoch. Additionally, Fig. 3 shows the overall training loss curve for the ground-truthed training and validation sets, indicating that the training loss decreased over time, which could also suggest that the completion of training was determined based on the convergence of the training loss. However, it is not explicitly stated what specific criteria were used to determine when training was complete.
