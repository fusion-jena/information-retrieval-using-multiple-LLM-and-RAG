Unfortunately, the given context does not provide explicit information about any preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model. However, it can be assumed that some form of preprocessing would have been performed due to its importance in preparing raw data for effective machine learning tasks. Common preprocessing techniques include normalization or standardization, scaling, noise removal, missing value imputation, encoding categorical variables, etc. These methods help improve the quality of input data, reduce computational complexity, and enhance the overall performance of the model.
