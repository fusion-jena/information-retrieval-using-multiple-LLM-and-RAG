While the given context does not explicitly mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models, it does provide information about the types of networks employed. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are mentioned as being particularly useful for classification tasks involving many features. Additionally, other network architectures like ResNet are also suggested as potential alternatives.

However, without explicit reference to frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, it cannot be definitively stated which framework was used to construct these neural networks. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, I am unable to determine which frameworks were utilized to build the deep learning models.
