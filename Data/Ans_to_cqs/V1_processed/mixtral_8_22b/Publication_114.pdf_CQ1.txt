The paper discusses the application of deep learning methods for tree species diversity mapping using high-resolution RGB images and LiDAR data. However, it does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Nevertheless, we can infer some possible methods based on the information provided.

For instance, the authors mention that they used high-resolution RGB images and LiDAR data. This suggests that they might have employed various sensors such as digital cameras for capturing RGB images and LiDAR scanners for obtaining detailed topographical information. Additionally, the authors note that their methodology could benefit from crowd-sourced tree samples, implying that citizen science initiatives or online platforms could potentially contribute to data collection efforts.

Moreover, the paper acknowledges that deep learning approaches often necessitate substantial amounts of training data. To address this requirement, the authors point out that there are benchmark datasets publicly available for training and testing deep learning models in remote sensing fields like LULC classification, urban feature extraction, and crop detection. Although these datasets may not directly pertain to tree species diversity mapping, they underscore the significance of leveraging existing resources when gathering raw data for deep learning pipelines.

In summary, while the paper does not provide explicit details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it implies that sensor technologies such as digital cameras and LiDAR scanners, along with crowd-sourced tree samples and publicly accessible benchmark datasets, could play crucial roles in acquiring necessary input data for deep learning applications in remote sensing.
