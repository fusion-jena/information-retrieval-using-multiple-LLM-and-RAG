The given context does not provide specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it mentions that the authors utilized ChatGPT for spell checking, grammar checking, and debugging in code to improve readability. Additionally, they recommended using missing value imputation as part of the data preprocessing pipeline to preserve valuable data and improve the accuracy of Footprint Identification Technique (FIT) predictions when low-quality footprints are included. It is also mentioned that their findings were supported by a study using deep learning models to classify three sympatric otter species. Therefore, while the exact data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that some form of image processing and labeling may have been involved based on the use of deep learning models for classification tasks.
