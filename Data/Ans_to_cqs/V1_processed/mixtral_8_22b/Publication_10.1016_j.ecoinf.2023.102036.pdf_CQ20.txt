The text mentions that the training was performed on an Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9900K CPU @ 3.60GHz processor and 32GB RAM memory. However, there is no explicit mention of any specific hardware accelerators like Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) being used for training the deep learning model. Therefore, based solely on the given context, one can only infer that the training process utilized a powerful multi-core CPU and a significant amount of RAM but cannot definitively state whether GPUs or TPUs were employed during this stage.
