The text does not explicitly mention which specific deep learning framework is used to build the model. However, since the training was done within the Google Colab platform, it could be assumed that either TensorFlow or PyTorch were used, as they are both popular choices supported by Google Colab. But without explicit information, it cannot be definitively stated which one was used.
