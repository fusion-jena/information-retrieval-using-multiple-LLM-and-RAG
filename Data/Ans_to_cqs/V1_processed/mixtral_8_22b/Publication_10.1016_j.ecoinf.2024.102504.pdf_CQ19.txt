Unfortunately, none of the provided sources explicitly mention the specific frameworks used to build their respective deep learning models. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer based solely on these references. However, some commonly used frameworks for building deep learning models include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. These tools offer powerful capabilities for designing, training, and deploying complex neural networks. It would be necessary to consult additional resources or contact the authors directly to determine the exact frameworks employed in each case.
