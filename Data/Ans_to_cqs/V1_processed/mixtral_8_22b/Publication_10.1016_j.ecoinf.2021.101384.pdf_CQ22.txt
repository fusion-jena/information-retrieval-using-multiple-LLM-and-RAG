The text does not explicitly mention any specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does discuss aspects related to the precision and completeness of the data used in the analysis. It mentions that the statistical analysis has a higher precision when vessel data are abundant and that the precision of the workflow's output depends on factors such as the completeness of the input vessel data and the suitability of the selected spatial resolution for the analysis. Additionally, it notes that the classification and spatio-temporal aggregation of data can help compensate for biases, especially when using large input datasets. While these points do not directly address the evaluation metrics for the deep learning model, they suggest that precision and completeness may be important considerations in assessing the overall effectiveness of the approach.
