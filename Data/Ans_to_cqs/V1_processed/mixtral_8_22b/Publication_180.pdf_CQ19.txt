The deep learning model is built using TensorFlow, an open-source software platform released by researchers at Google. This platform was chosen due to its ability to eliminate the need for image preprocessing in the identification system. The authors adjusted two parameters from their default values within TensorFlow: validation percentage and number of training steps. They increased the validation percentage to 16% due to limited available images for certain species and experimented with various numbers of training steps to find the optimal balance between computation time and classification efficiency.
