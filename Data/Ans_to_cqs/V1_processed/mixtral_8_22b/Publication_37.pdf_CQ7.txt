In this study, the authors divided the CLO-43SD dataset into five folds for performing 5-fold cross-validation. This means that they split the dataset into five equal parts or 'folds'. Four of these folds are used for training the model, while one fold is held back for testing. This process is repeated five times, such that each fold serves once as the test set. Additionally, for identifying the best training epoch for the CNN model, one of the four training folds was used as a validation set, and the model was trained on the remaining three folds. Therefore, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in this case were 5-fold cross-validation and using one fold as a validation set within the training data.
