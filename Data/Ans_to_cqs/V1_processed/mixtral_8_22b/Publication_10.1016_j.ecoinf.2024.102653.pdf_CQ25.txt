The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, based on the information provided about the performance metrics used to evaluate the model, it can be inferred that the model is likely designed for a binary classification task. This is because the listed performance metrics, such as confusion matrices, accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, Cohen Kappa, and the area under the ROC curve, are commonly used for evaluating the performance of binary classification models. Additionally, the mention of the Binary Cross Entropy loss function further supports this inference. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model is most likely intended for binary classification purposes.
