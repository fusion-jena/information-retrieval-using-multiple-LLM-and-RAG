Based on the given context, there isn't explicit mention of specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, the text does indicate that the proposed method demonstrates superior performance across a diverse range of environments, suggesting that the model was tested under varied conditions to ensure its robustness and applicability. Furthermore, the use of a joint training approach for image adaptive enhancement modules and deep learning models implies that efforts were made to optimize the model's performance by integrating different components of the system. Nonetheless, without more detailed information about the training process, it is not possible to definitively state what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
