The text does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, it mentions that the algorithm was trained on an RTX 3090 for 6 hours under the same training environment and epoch. It also compares the training time of the original YOLOv5 algorithm, which took 12 hours. These details suggest that the duration or number of epochs might be one of the factors considered to decide when the training should stop. Nevertheless, without further context, we cannot definitively conclude what criteria were used to determine when training was complete.
