The deep learning pipeline presented in the given context uses audio data format. This can be inferred from the fact that the framework monitors bird species based on their vocalizations, which implies the use of audio data. Furthermore, the BirdNET-Analyzer deep learning model mentioned in the text is specifically designed for processing audio data related to bird sounds. Therefore, it can be concluded that the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is audio.
