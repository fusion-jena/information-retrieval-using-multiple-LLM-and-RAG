Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does state that the classification accuracy and performance improved as data increased during the training of a deep learning model using satellite imagery over multiple periods. This suggests that accuracy might be one of the metrics used to measure the performance of the deep learning model. Additionally, since the study mentions using the U-Net model, which is a type of CNN used for image segmentation tasks, other common evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, or Intersection over Union (IoU) may also be used. These metrics are often employed when evaluating the performance of deep learning models in image segmentation tasks. Nevertheless, without explicit confirmation from the authors or further context, this remains speculative.
