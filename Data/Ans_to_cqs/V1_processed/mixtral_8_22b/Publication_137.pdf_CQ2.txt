The given context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the input data consists of point clouds, which are a type of 3D data structure consisting of a collection of points in space. In this case, the point cloud data is being used for segmentation tasks using a SuperPoint Graph (SPG) framework.

Furthermore, the context mentions that some deep learning methods convert point clouds into a large number of 2D images and further process them using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This suggests that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline could be either point cloud or 2D images generated from point clouds.

Additionally, the context references several papers related to deep learning and computer vision, including one paper titled "Deep-learning-based classification for DTM extraction from ALS point cloud" (Hu & Yuan, 2016). This indicates that the authors may have used LiDAR point cloud data as their input data format.

Therefore, while the exact data format used in the deep learning pipeline is not specified, it can be inferred that the input data consists of point cloud data, potentially converted into 2D images for processing using CNNs.
