The text does not provide information about the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. It only mentions that machine learning models like Random Forest, Multilayer Perceptron, Long Short Term Memory, and Support Vector Regression have been used successfully to predict different algal-related parameters. However, it does not specify whether these models were built using TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other framework. Therefore, based on the given context, we cannot determine which frameworks were used to build the deep learning model.
