The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, based on the information available, it can be inferred that the model is being used for ecological niche modeling. This type of modeling involves using species occurrence and prevalence data to predict the geographic distribution of species. In this case, the model is being used to predict the potential effects of climate change on animal spatial distribution in a specific basin. It appears that the model is trained using MaxEnt, a popular algorithm for ecological niche modeling, and produces spatial species distributions over time for multiple species. These distributions are then binarized through thresholding and combined to obtain species richness. Therefore, the overall goal of the model seems to be to provide insights into how climate change may impact biodiversity in the basin.
