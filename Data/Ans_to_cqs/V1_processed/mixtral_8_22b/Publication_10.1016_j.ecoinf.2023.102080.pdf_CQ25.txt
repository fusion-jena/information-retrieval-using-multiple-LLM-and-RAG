Based on the given context, there is no mention of a deep learning model being used. The context discusses the use of Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) with elastic-net regularization and Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) with null-space penalization for fitting models with embedded selection procedures. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the purpose of a deep learning model from this context.
