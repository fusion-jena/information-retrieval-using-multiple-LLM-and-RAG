The text does not provide explicit information about the specific deep learning framework used to build the model. However, it mentions that TensorBoard was used to monitor the experiments, suggesting that TensorFlow could have been utilized since TensorBoard is a tool integrated into TensorFlow for visualizing metrics during training. Nonetheless, without further clarification, it cannot be definitively confirmed if TensorFlow was indeed the chosen framework.
