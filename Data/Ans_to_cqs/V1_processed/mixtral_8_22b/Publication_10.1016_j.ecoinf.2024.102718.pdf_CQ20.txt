For training the BEiT deep learning model, the authors utilized an NVIDIA RTX 3060 Ti GPU along with an AMD Ryzen 9 5900X CPU and 32GB of RAM. This combination of hardware resources was chosen to provide robust processing capabilities required for managing large datasets and intricate model architectures. Additionally, the model development took place within a TensorFlow framework inside a Jupyter Notebook environment, which facilitated an interactive setup allowing for real-time modifications and visual feedback.
