Based on the given information, it appears that the primary metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models is Mean Squared Error (MSE). This can be seen in the statement regarding the RY models, where it says "the best performing models (based on MSE)" indicating that MSE was used as the evaluation metric. Additionally, the use of early stopping to prevent overfitting suggests that some form of error or loss function was being minimized during training, although this isn't explicitly stated. However, there is no mention of other common classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall, suggesting that these weren't used in evaluating the models.
