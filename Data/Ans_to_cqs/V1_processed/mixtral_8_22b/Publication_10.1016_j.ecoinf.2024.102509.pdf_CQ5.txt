The information provided does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for land use and land cover classification. However, it mentions the use of an imagery dataset acquired from the Pleiades-1B satellite, which consists of four spectral bands (blue, green, red, and near infrared) with a fine spatial resolution of 2 meters and one panchromatic band (480â€“820 nm) with a resolution of 0.50 meters. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm was then applied to classify this imagery dataset into eight Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) categories. Additionally, the text references the World Agroforestry Centre databases, but it does not specify whether these databases were utilized in the deep learning pipeline or for what purpose they were used.
