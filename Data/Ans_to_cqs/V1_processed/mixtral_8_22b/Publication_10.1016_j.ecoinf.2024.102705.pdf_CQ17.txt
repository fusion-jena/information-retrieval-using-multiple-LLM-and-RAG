Regularization methods are techniques used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty to the loss function or modifying the architecture of the neural network. Two common regularization methods mentioned in the given context are Dropout and L2 Regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent overfitting by making the network more robust and reducing its reliance on any single feature. This forces the network to learn redundant representations of the input data, leading to better generalization.

L2 Regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. By penalizing large weights, L2 Regularization encourages smaller and more distributed weight values, promoting a simpler and more generalized model.

Other regularization methods not explicitly mentioned in the given context include L1 Regularization, Early Stopping, and Data Augmentation. L1 Regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the absolute value of the weights, encouraging sparse solutions. Early Stopping monitors the validation error during training and stops when it starts increasing, preventing further overfitting. Data Augmentation generates additional training samples by applying random transformations to existing ones, artificially expanding the dataset and improving the model's ability to generalize.
