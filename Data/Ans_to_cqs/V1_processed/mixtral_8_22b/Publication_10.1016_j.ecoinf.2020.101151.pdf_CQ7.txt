The context does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, or validation sets. However, based on common practices in machine learning, we can infer that the dataset might have been divided randomly, stratified, or sequentially. Random splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets without any specific order, while stratified sampling ensures that each subset maintains the same distribution of classes as the original dataset. Sequential splitting separates the dataset chronologically, where earlier data points are used for training and later ones for testing and validation. In this case, since there is no mention of time series data, random or stratified splitting could have been employed.
