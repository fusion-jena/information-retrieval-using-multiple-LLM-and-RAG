In evaluating the performance of the deep learning model, several metrics are employed. These include precision (P), recall (R), harmonic mean of P and R (F1), and mean average precision (mAP). Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made by the model. Recall, also known as sensitivity or true positive rate, quantifies the proportion of actual positives correctly identified by the model. The F1 score provides a single metric that combines both precision and recall into a single value, offering a balanced measure between these two aspects. Lastly, mAP serves as an indicator of the overall performance of the model across various thresholds, providing a comprehensive assessment of its effectiveness.
