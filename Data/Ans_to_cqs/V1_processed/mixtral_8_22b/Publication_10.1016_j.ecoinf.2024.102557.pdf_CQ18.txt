To monitor the model performance during training, the authors employed Bayesian optimization focused on reducing the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the predictions based on environmental cross-validation with ten folds. This process was carried out using the R package "mlr3mbo". The goal of this approach was to tune the model hyperparameters for each species-specific model, ensuring optimal performance. The search space of optimal hyperparameters was defined by the ranges of "mtry" (number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split), "min.node.size" (minimum size of terminal nodes), and "num.trees" (number of trees to grow).
