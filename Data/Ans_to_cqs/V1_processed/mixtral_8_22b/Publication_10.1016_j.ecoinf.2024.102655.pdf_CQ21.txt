The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices. However, it is common practice in machine learning to perform various types of analysis and evaluation after a model has been trained. These can include generating visualizations like saliency maps to understand what parts of the input data most influence the model's predictions, calculating performance metrics to quantify how well the model performs on unseen data, and creating confusion matrices to summarize the model's correct and incorrect classifications. It should be noted that these are general practices and may not necessarily apply to every situation. Therefore, without more specific information about the particular machine learning application being discussed, it is difficult to provide a definitive list of postprocessing steps.
