The paper uses several metrics to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Top-1 accuracy, Top-5 accuracy, Top-1 error, and Top-5 error. The formulas for these metrics are not explicitly mentioned but they are commonly known in machine learning literature. For example, Accuracy is calculated as the sum of true positives (TP) and true negatives (TN) divided by the total number of samples. Precision is calculated as the ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives. Recall is calculated as the ratio of true positive predictions to the actual positives. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. Top-k accuracy refers to whether the correct label is among the top k most probable classes according to the model.
