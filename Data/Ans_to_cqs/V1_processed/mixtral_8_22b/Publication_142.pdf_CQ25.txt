The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the provided context is for classification. Specifically, it is designed to identify plant species based on input images. This is achieved using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture called the inception model, which has been extended with batch normalization. The network is initially trained on the ImageNet dataset and then fine-tuned using Pl@ntNet data, covering over 30,000 species and utilizing millions of images. The primary function of this deep learning model is to provide a list of likely species when presented with one to five images of a plant. It accomplishes this by returning the softmax output of the CNN along with a list of matching images retrieved from its extensive database.
