The given context does not provide information about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model such as learning rate or optimizer. Instead, it discusses various aspects of evaluating models using Area Under Curve (AUC), True Positive Rate (TPR), True Skill Statistic (TSS), and Cohen's kappa coefficient (k). It also mentions the use of the 10th percentile training presence as a threshold for generating models. However, there is no mention of any hyperparameters related to a deep learning model.
