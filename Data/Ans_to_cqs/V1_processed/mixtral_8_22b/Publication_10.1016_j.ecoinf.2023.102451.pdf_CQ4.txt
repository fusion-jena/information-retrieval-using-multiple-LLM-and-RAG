Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does state that some preprocessing steps such as data augmentation were performed to address the diversity of training data and data imbalance problems in classification tasks. Commonly used data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, translation, and adding noise. Therefore, it can be inferred that similar techniques might have been employed here, but without explicit confirmation, we cannot definitively determine which ones were utilized.
