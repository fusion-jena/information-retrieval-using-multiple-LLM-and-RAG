The given context does not provide specific information on the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on common practices in deep learning pipelines, some possible data annotation techniques include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. These techniques help label or classify objects within images or videos, which is crucial for training machine learning models. Without explicit mention in the provided context, it cannot be confirmed if these techniques were employed in this particular study.

Based on the keywords and references mentioned, we can infer that the study involves multi-year fieldwork, open access data, big data, socio-economic factors, and machine learning ensemble predictions using RandomForest, Treenet, CART, and MARS algorithms. Additionally, the study uses geographical information systems (GIS), ARCGIS, and various datasets such as Fairbanks Borough GIS, Forest Layer Tanana Valley State Forest, Alaska Clearinghouse, and Alaska US Census Portal. However, there is no direct reference to any specific data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline.
