The information provided does not specify where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that the dataset was divided into three parts: 70% for the training set, 10% for the validation set, and 20% for the test set. However, it does not provide any details about the source or location of the dataset. Therefore, based on the given information, I do not have enough knowledge to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
