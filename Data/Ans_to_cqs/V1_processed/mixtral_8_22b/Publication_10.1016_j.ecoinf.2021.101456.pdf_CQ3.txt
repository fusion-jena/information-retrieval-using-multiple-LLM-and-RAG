The provided context does not explicitly mention specific data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Instead, it focuses on the use of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) for dimensionality reduction and semi-supervised clustering. However, there is a brief reference to using a small subset of labeled data to improve the quality of learned representations. This suggests that some form of supervised learning may have been employed during training, but the exact nature of the labeling process is not specified. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed description of the data annotation techniques used in this particular case.
