Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, the context does provide information about various studies that have utilized machine learning and deep learning methods for predicting dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in water bodies. These studies include works by authors like Heddam, S., Kim, S., Mehr, A.D., Zounemat-Kermani, M., Malik, A., Elbeltagi, A., et al., 2022b; Heddam, S., Lamda, H., Filali, S., 2016; Heddam, S., Yaseen, Z.M., Falah, M.W., Goliatt, L., Tan, M.L., Sa’adi, Z., Ahmadianfar, I., Saggi, M., Bhatia, A., Samui, P., 2022; Huan, J., Cao, W., Liu, X., 2017; Areerachakul, S., Sophatsathit, P., Lursinsap, C., 2013; Arepalli, P.G., Naik, K.J., 2024 Mar.; Arora, S., Keshari, A.K., 2021; Ay, M., Kisi, O., 2012; and Ay, M., Kis¸i, 2017.

These studies employed various machine learning and deep learning algorithms, including SVR, LSTM, GRNN, ANFIS, and others, to predict DO concentrations. Some of these studies considered additional environmental factors like temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure as input variables for their models. While the exact datasets used in these studies remain unknown from the provided context, they likely involved time series or spatial data related to water quality parameters and other relevant environmental factors.
