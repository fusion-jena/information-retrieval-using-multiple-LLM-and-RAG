The query asks for the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, but based on the given context, there is no mention of any specific deep learning pipeline or datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the context discusses the use of several NDVI datasets in a study related to vegetation dynamics. Therefore, I cannot directly answer the query with the provided context. However, I can list the datasets mentioned in the context:

1. 16-day synthesized MOD13Q1 V6 NDVI dataset (MODIS NDVI)
2. Daily NOAA Climate Data Record (CDR) of AVHRR NDVI V5 dataset (CDR AVHRR NDVI)
3. Third generation GIMMS NDVI from AVHRR sensors dataset (GIMMS NDVI)
4. SPOT/VEGETATION products (SPOT NDVI)
