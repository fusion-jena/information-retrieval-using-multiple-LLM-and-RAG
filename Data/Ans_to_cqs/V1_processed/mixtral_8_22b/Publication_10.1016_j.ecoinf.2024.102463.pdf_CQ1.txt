Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge, common methods for gathering raw data include surveys, sensors, and public datasets. Surveys involve collecting data through questionnaires or interviews, while sensors measure physical quantities like temperature, pressure, or radiation levels. Public datasets are collections of data made available by various organizations, governments, or researchers, often accessible online. In the context of environmental studies, data collection might involve deploying sensors along rivers to monitor water quality, using satellite imagery, or accessing historical records from government agencies.
