The paper uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as its deep learning model. This can be seen in several places throughout the text, such as when it mentions "our deep learning CNN" and "ImageNet pre-trained ResNet34 model". Additionally, the use of transfer learning and data augmentation techniques like vertical flipping of images and limiting overexposure are common practices in CNN applications.
