The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific process used to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. However, it is mentioned that the model was run on independent validation and test splits of the acquired data and applied to continuous soundscape recordings. This suggests that some form of deployment was carried out to use the trained model for these tasks. Without further information, it cannot be determined exactly what process was followed for deployment.
