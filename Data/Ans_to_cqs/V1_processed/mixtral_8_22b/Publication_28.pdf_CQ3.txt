The given context does not provide specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipelines mentioned. However, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and landmark annotation. These techniques help label datasets with relevant information required for training machine learning models. Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest within an image or video frame. Semantic segmentation involves assigning each pixel in an image to a class label, while instance segmentation involves identifying individual object instances within an image. Polygon annotation involves outlining complex shapes within an image, while key point annotation involves marking specific points on an object such as joints or facial features. Landmark annotation involves placing dots on specific parts of an object to define its shape or pose. It is essential to choose the appropriate annotation technique depending on the task requirements and the nature of the data being labeled.
