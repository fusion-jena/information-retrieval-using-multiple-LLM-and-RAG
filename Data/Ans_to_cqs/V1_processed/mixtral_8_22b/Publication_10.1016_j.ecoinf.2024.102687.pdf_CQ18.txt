From the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of a specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, we can infer some aspects about how the model was evaluated and monitored based on the available information.

Firstly, the model was fine-tuned using the Adam optimizer with a default learning rate of 0.0001 and a weight decay of 0. Fine-tuning was performed on the entire model for 100 epochs, with one epoch corresponding to 500 episodic tasks. This suggests that the model's performance might be tracked after each epoch or even after every few epochs to observe its improvement over time.

Secondly, two episodic tasks were constructed from the training set with 5 way-1 shot and 5 way-5 shot tasks. These tasks could potentially serve as evaluation metrics to assess the model's performance during training. By comparing the results obtained from these tasks before and after fine-tuning, researchers would gain insights into whether the model has improved or not.

Lastly, latent space representations were extracted from the backbone of the model to evaluate their capacity to improve the quality of clustering. This implies that the model's ability to generate meaningful latent representations was also considered when monitoring its performance.

However, without more detailed information regarding the implementation of the training process, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer on the exact strategy employed to monitor the model performance during training.
