The study uses several datasets derived from the original dataset by taking different percentages (40%, 60%, and 80%) of it and replacing varying proportions of those subsets with generated images. These datasets are labeled as G1\_Dataset1 through G3\_Dataset3\_mixup. The specific details of the original dataset are not mentioned in the given information. However, the datasets are divided into training and testing sets in an 8:2 ratio, and all evaluation metrics are calculated based on the test set. The classification experiments are performed using ResNet18, VGG16, and MobileNetV2 as the base classifier models with consistent hyperparameters such as a learning rate of 0.001, a batch size of 32, and 40 epochs.
