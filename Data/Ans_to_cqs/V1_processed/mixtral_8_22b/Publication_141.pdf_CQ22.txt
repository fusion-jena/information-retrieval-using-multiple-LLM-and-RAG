The primary metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this study is classification accuracy. This can be seen throughout the given text, such as when it mentions "The classification accuracy based on our CNN approach is the highest...ever demonstrated" or when discussing specific percentages like "99.47% for the species model and 100% for genus and sub-family models." Additionally, the term 'accuracy' is mentioned multiple times in relation to both training and validation datasets. However, there is no explicit mention of other common evaluation metrics like precision or recall. Therefore, we can conclude that the main metric used to assess the performance of the deep learning model in this case is classification accuracy.
