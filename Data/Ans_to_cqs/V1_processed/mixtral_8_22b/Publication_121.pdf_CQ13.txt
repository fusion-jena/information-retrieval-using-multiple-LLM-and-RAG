The document mentions that the deep learning model with the base model of MobileNetV2 was compiled and optimized with the Adam optimizer. On the other hand, the models with the base models of MobileNetV3 were optimized with gradient descent. However, the specific hyperparameters like learning rates or any additional details about the optimization methods are not mentioned in the given text.
