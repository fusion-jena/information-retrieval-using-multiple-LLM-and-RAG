The pipeline uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) as its deep learning model. This is mentioned in the beginning of section 4.2, stating that CNNs stand out among Deep Learning techniques due to their ability to disentangle high-level representations across multiple processing layers. Furthermore, the text explains how CNNs process data on two levels: a convolutional block for automatic feature extraction, and fully connected layers to establish feature-output correlation. Four pre-trained models are compared within the pipeline: AlexNet, VGG-19, ResNet-101, and DenseNet-201.
