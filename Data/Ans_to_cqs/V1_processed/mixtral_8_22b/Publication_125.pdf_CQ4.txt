The study employs several data augmentation techniques to enhance the efficiency of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The specific techniques used include a 90-degree rotation range, a zoom and shear range of 20%, a brightness scale between 0.2 to 1.0, and a shift range of 20% in both height and width. Additionally, horizontal and vertical flips were also applied. These methods help increase the amount of data available for training the proposed CNN model without requiring additional data acquisition. Figure 6 illustrates sample image data augmentations using these techniques.
