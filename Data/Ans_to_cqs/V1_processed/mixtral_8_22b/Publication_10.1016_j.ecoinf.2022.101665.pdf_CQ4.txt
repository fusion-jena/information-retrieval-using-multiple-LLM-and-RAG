The given context does not provide information on data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotation, or scaling. However, it discusses methods for evaluating the accuracy of thematic maps produced by calibrated statistical prediction methods when data availability is limited. These methods include using a training set for fitting models, a validation set for estimating prediction errors and hyperparameter tuning, and a test set for assessing the accuracy of the final model. When data availability is scarce, resampling methods like cross-validation can be employed. Additionally, the text mentions two model-based methods for computing map accuracy metrics from simulated residuals.
