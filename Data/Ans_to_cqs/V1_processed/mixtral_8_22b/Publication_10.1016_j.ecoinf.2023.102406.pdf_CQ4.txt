The given text does not discuss any data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotating, scaling, etc. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer based on the given context. However, these techniques are often used in image processing tasks to increase the amount of training data by creating modified versions of images in the dataset. This helps improve model performance and prevent overfitting.
