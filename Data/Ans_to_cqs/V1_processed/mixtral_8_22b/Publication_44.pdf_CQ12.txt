The pipeline utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based architecture known as DeepLabv3+. It employs a modified ResNet-101 or Xception model as its backbone for feature extraction. The network incorporates Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP), which allows capturing information from a larger receptive field of view without increasing the number of parameters. Additionally, Depth-wise Separable Convolution is applied to both ASPP and the decoder module to enhance the speed and robustness of the encoder-decoder network. The training process involves adapting a pre-trained VGG16 network, freezing earlier layers, and adding extra max-pooling layers to reduce dimensionality and computational complexity.
