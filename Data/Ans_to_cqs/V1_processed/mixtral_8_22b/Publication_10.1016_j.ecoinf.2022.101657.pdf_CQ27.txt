The provided context does not explicitly state the process used to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it mentions that further research is required to identify and automate a process that, given a set of species of interest, outputs a robust and reliable neural network model with suitable weights. This suggests that the researchers are still working on developing a methodology for deploying their customized neural networks. Additionally, the text discusses the desire to reduce power consumption using low-power neural networks implemented in hardware like Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). This implies that the researchers might be considering hardware platforms for deploying their models. Unfortunately, without more specific information about the deployment process, I cannot provide a detailed answer.
