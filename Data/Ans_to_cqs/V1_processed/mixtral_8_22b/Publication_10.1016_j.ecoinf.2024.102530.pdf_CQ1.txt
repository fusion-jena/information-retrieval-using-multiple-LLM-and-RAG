The study utilizes various methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. For instance, it employs annual LULC maps with a spatial resolution of 10 meters, which provide detailed information about land use and cover changes over time. Additionally, the study incorporates daily weather data with a spatial resolution of 2.5 kilometers, offering insights into meteorological conditions affecting honey bee flight times and performance. Moreover, the research combines LULC map and BDPPAD information to acquire precise data on agricultural land area and usage. The BDPPAD is a database containing agricultural parcel and production records connected to client profiles from La Financière Agricole du Québec (FADQ), encompassing vector polygons outlining agricultural plots and covering most of Quebec's agricultural territory. Lastly, the study also leverages GeoBase Addresses Quebec, providing geospatial data related to addresses within Quebec. These diverse sources of raw data contribute significantly to the accuracy and reliability of the deep learning models employed in the study.
