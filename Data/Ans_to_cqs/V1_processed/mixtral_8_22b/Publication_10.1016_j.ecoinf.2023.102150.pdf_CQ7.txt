The table provides information about the dataset used for training, validating, and testing the deep learning model. The dataset is split into three parts: training images, validation images, and out-of-sample test images. Training images are used to teach the model how to recognize different classes, while validation images are used to fine-tune the model parameters during training. Out-of-sample test images are used to evaluate the final performance of the model after training has finished. Additionally, there are also new training images selected for model retraining. These images are likely chosen based on specific criteria such as improving the model's ability to identify certain species or adding images from new locations. It is important to note that all training images should be reviewed manually to ensure they are correctly labeled and do not contain any errors.
