The provided context does not explicitly mention which specific metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models. However, it does indicate that one metric used is the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the predictions. This is done through Bayesian optimization focused on reducing the RMSE of the predictions based on environmental cross-validation with ten folds. Therefore, while we cannot definitively state that other common evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall are used, we can confirm that RMSE is indeed utilized.
