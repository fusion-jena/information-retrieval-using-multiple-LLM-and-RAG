The text mentions that the authors resorted to purely deterministic variants of certain architectures. However, it does not explicitly state what specific types of architectures were used. It can be inferred from the context that Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) might have been considered due to their effectiveness in capturing time dependencies. Furthermore, the mention of Transformer-based architectures suggests that these could also have been part of the pipeline. Unfortunately, without explicit confirmation, it cannot be definitively stated which specific type of deep learning model was used in the pipeline.
