The text does not provide explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that CNNs were trained on a patch-level, suggesting that some form of image segmentation was likely employed during the data preparation stage. Image segmentation involves partitioning an image into multiple segments or regions, often based on pixel intensity values or other characteristics. This technique can help identify objects within images, making it useful for various applications, including object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. In the case of wetland mapping, image segmentation could involve identifying different types of wetlands, such as marshes, swamps, and bogs, based on their unique visual characteristics. Additionally, the text refers to the use of field validation data, indicating that ground truth data collection was also part of the data preparation process. Ground truth data is essential for training and evaluating machine learning models, providing a reference against which model predictions can be compared. Without more detailed information, it is impossible to determine precisely what data annotation techniques were used in the deep learning pipeline. Still, it is clear that both image segmentation and ground truth data collection played significant roles in preparing the data for analysis.
