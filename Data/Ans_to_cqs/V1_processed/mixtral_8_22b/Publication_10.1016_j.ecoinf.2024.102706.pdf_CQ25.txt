The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in this context is not explicitly stated. However, based on the given information, it appears that the deep learning approach being referred to is the application of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) for semantic segmentation across various types of young vegetation cover. Semantic segmentation involves assigning a label or category to every pixel in an image, which could be useful for tasks such as identifying different types of vegetation or estimating canopy cover. Therefore, it seems that the primary purpose of the DCNN model in this case would be to perform semantic segmentation of satellite images to aid in the analysis and modeling of forest canopy cover.
