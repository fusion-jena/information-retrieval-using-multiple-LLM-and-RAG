In this case, the dataset used in the deep learning pipeline isn't explicitly named as one of the common datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it is mentioned that the dataset consists of images, with a total of 4,867 images divided into three sets: training, validation, and testing. The training set comprises the majority of the data (82%) with 4,000 images, while the validation set contains 607 images (13%), and the testing set has 260 images (5%). During the preprocessing phase, techniques like auto-orientation, resizing, tiling, and filtering were applied to standardize and enrich the dataset. Images were made consistent in orientation and had a uniform size of 640 x 640 pixels. Data augmentation was performed by introducing random saturation adjustments to each training example, increasing the number of outputs per example to two. Although not specifically identified, the dataset appears to have been customized for this particular study.
