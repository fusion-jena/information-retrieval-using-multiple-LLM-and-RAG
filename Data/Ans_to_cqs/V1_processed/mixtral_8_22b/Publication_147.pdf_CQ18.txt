The text does not provide explicit information about the strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions that the CNN model was trained for 110 epochs using a geometrically decaying learning rate. It also states that the XGBoost model parameters were tuned using grid search functions to find the optimal value based on the test error metric. These details suggest that some form of monitoring was performed during the training phase, but the specific strategy remains unclear without additional context.
