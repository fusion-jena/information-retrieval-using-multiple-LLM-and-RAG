The study uses a grid search method (GridSearchCV) based on the out-of-bag (OOB) error and five-fold cross-validation to monitor the model performance during training. This approach helps in searching for the optimal parameters of the model. The n\_estimators are spaced at 50 intervals, ranging from 100 to 1000. The minleaf is set to 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50. The max\_features are spaced at intervals of 1, ranging from 1 to k where k is the number of characteristic variables.
