Hyperparameters of the model are optimized using Bayesian optimization focused on reducing the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the predictions based on environmental cross-validation with ten folds. This process is implemented in the R package "mlr3mbo". The search space of optimal hyperparameters is defined by the ranges of "mtry" (number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split), "min.node.size" (minimum size of terminal nodes), and "num.trees" (number of trees to grow). The specific values for these parameters are not mentioned but can be found in Table S3.
