Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning model being discussed is an AODEGRU model. However, the exact hyperparameters used in this model are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. Typically, common hyperparameters used in deep learning models include learning rate, optimizer type (such as Adam or SGD), number of layers, number of units in each layer, dropout rate, batch size, and others depending on the specific architecture and requirements of the task. In order to determine the exact hyperparameters used in this particular AODEGRU model, additional information would be needed.
