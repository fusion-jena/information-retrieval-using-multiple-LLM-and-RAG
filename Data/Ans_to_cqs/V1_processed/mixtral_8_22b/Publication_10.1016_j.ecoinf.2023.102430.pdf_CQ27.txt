The text does not provide information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. It only mentions the implementation of AN in MATLAB and the use of stochastic gradient descent with momentum optimizer during training. However, it does not discuss how the trained model is deployed or any specific details regarding model serialization or platform selection.
