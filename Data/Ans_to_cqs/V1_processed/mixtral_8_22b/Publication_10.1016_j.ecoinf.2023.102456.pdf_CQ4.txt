The given context does not provide information about specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, padding, and adding noise. These techniques help increase the amount of training data available and prevent overfitting by introducing variations into the dataset.
