Based on the given context, it does not provide explicit information about the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, considering the nature of the research, which involves modeling fish distribution in a mesotrophic lake using hydroacoustic surveys and artificial neural networks, it can be inferred that the data format used might include numerical or tabular data such as CSV files containing measurements from the hydroacoustic surveys. Additionally, since the study uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), the data would likely need to be preprocessed into a suitable format for feeding into the network, typically involving normalization and scaling of features. Nevertheless, without further details regarding the exact data collection methods and processing steps, it remains uncertain what other types of data formats could potentially be involved in the deep learning pipeline.
