The given context does not provide information about specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on textual data processing methods like word embeddings, language understanding, and natural language processing. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact data annotation techniques used in this case.
