The article does not provide specific information on handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, including managing random seed values. However, some common strategies to manage randomness in deep learning pipelines include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using techniques like cross-validation or bootstrapping to reduce variability, and employing ensemble methods to combine multiple models trained with different initializations. These strategies help improve the robustness and reliability of deep learning models by reducing the impact of random factors on their performance.
