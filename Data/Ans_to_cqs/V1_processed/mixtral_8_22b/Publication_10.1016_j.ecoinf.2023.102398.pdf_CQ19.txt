The text does not provide information about the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. However, since the authors mention using CUDA version 12.0, we can infer that they likely used either TensorFlow or PyTorch, as both support CUDA acceleration for deep learning tasks. Without further details, it is impossible to definitively state which framework was used.
