After the model training, several postprocessing steps can be employed depending on the requirements of the project. Some common postprocessing techniques include generating saliency maps, calculating evaluation metrics, and creating confusion matrices.

Saliency maps help visualize which parts of the input image contribute most significantly towards the final prediction made by the model. This technique involves computing gradients of the predicted class score concerning the input pixels, highlighting areas of high importance.

Calculating evaluation metrics is essential to assess the performance of the trained model accurately. Commonly used metrics include precision, recall, F1-score, area under the curve (AUC), Cohen's kappa coefficient, etc. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to correctly identify positive instances, minimize false positives/negatives, and maintain a balance between precision and recall.

Creating confusion matrices offers another way to evaluate the model's performance visually. A confusion matrix is a table layout that allows us to see if the system is confusing two classes (i.e., mislabeling one as another). It provides detailed information about actual vs. predicted values, enabling users to understand the types of errors produced by the model.

In summary, postprocessing steps after model training may consist of generating saliency maps, calculating evaluation metrics, and constructing confusion matrices. Each method serves a unique purpose in evaluating the model's performance and understanding its strengths and weaknesses better.
