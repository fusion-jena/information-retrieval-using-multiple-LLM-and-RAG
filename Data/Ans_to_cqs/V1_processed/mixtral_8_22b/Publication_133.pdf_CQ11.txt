The information regarding the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer to your query based on the provided information. However, it is worth noting that the paper mentions the use of datasets from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) homepage. Unfortunately, without additional details or access to the full research article, I am unable to determine if the authors shared their specific dataset or deep learning pipeline on any public repositories like Zenodo, Figshare, or Dryad.
