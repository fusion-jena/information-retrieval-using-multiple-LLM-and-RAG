To deploy the trained deep learning model, the authors used graphics processing units (GPUs) and specialized hardware components for running parallel arithmetic operations. They conducted their analysis using the Google Cloud suite of cloud platform (<https://console.cloud.google.com>). However, the exact process of how they deployed the trained deep learning model is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. It can be assumed that they serialized the trained model and then uploaded it to the Google Cloud platform for deployment. But without further information, it cannot be confirmed.
