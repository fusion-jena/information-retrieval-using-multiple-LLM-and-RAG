The given context does not provide explicit details about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, or validation sets. However, generally, common practices include splitting the dataset randomly or using stratified sampling techniques to maintain class balance. In some cases, time series datasets may be divided chronologically, where earlier data is used for training and later data for testing/validation. It is also important to note that the proportion of data allocated to each set depends on factors such as the size of the dataset and the complexity of the problem being addressed. Common splits include 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing, but other ratios like 80/10/10 or 60/20/20 might also be employed depending on the requirements of the project.
