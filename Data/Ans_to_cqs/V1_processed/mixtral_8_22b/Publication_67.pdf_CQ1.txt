The study utilizes two main sources for collecting raw data: Google Earth and the Northwestern Polytechnic University (NWPU)-Remote Sensing Image Scene Classification (RESISC45) dataset. Google Earth is used to gather very high-resolution satellite and aerial RGB images, while the RESISC45 dataset provides additional image samples for training purposes. These sources contribute to the creation of five distinct training datasets, which include examples of images with different levels of tree cover, both continuous and discrete approximations, and an auxiliary class labeled as 'Non-Forest.' This approach ensures a diverse range of input data for the deep learning pipeline.
