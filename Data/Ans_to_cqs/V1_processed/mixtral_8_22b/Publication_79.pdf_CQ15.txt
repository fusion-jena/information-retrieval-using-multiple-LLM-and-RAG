The given context does not provide specific information on the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for mapping Brazilian Savanna physiognomies. However, common optimization techniques used in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). These methods help minimize the loss function during training by adjusting the model parameters iteratively based on the gradient of the loss with respect to those parameters. Other popular optimization algorithms include RMSProp, AdaGrad, and Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG). The choice of optimization technique depends on factors such as convergence speed, computational efficiency, and robustness to hyperparameters.
