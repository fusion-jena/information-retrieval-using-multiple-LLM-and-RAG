The purpose of the deep learning model used in this study is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, it can be inferred that the model is used for classification tasks. Specifically, the model is utilized to map the YAMNet embeddings to the available labels, which suggests that it is being used for multi-class classification. This is further supported by the mention of a Random Forest (RF) classifier, which is also typically used for classification tasks. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model is primarily used for classification purposes in this context.
