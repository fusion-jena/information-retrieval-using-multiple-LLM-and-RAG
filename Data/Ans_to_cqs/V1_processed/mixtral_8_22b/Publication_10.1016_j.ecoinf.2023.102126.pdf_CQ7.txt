Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to determine the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, common methods include splitting the data randomly, stratified sampling, time series splits, or even customized splits depending on the nature of the problem being solved. It would require additional details about the deep learning models being trained to provide a more accurate response.
