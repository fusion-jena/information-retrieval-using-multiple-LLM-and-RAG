Unfortunately, there is no explicit mention of any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline within the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based solely on the provided text. However, common data augmentation techniques often used in deep learning include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, translation, and adding noise or blurring. These methods help increase the size and diversity of datasets, improving the generalisation ability of deep learning models.
