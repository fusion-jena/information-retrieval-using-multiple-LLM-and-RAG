The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the researchers utilized image annotations for training their convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This is evident from the mention of datasets containing thousands of annotations, which were likely applied to images of coralligenous species or their broader taxonomical groups.

While the exact nature of these annotations isn't specified, they could have included various types such as bounding boxes, semantic segmentation, or instance segmentation. Bounding boxes involve outlining objects within an image with rectangles, while semantic segmentation entails labeling each pixel in an image according to its object category. Instance segmentation combines both approaches, where individual instances of objects are outlined and labeled separately.

In this case, considering the task involves identifying coralligenous species, it's plausible that the researchers employed either semantic segmentation or instance segmentation methods. These would allow them to accurately delineate and categorize the numerous organisms present in complex marine environments. Nonetheless, without further details, we cannot definitively determine the precise annotation technique used in this particular study.
