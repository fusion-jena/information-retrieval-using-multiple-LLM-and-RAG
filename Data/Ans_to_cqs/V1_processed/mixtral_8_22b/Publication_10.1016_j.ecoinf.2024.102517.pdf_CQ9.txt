The paper does not provide information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that the deep feature loss bird noise reduction network model was trained for 50 epochs on an RTX 2080 Ti GPU using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 10. Therefore, I do not have enough information to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
