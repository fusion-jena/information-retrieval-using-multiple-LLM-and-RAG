In the given context, the data is split into three subsets for training, validating, and testing the deep learning model. The first subset, known as the tuning set, consists of k-2 folds, while the second subset, referred to as the validation set, contains one fold. Lastly, the third subset, named the test set, also comprises one fold. The purpose of splitting the data into these subsets is to optimize the hyperparameters of the model, such as the number of iterations, and evaluate its performance accurately. By monitoring the performance on the validation set during training, the risk of overfitting can be mitigated, ensuring that the model generalizes well to unseen data. Additionally, the test set is utilized to assess the final performance of the trained model objectively.
