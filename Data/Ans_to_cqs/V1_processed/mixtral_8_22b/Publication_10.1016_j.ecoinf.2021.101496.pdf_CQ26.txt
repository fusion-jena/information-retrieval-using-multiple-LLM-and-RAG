The given context does not directly discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Instead, it focuses on various methods used for modeling SPAD values, including Linear Model (LM), Generalized Linear Model (GLM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). These methods are applied to datasets divided into training and testing subsets, but no specific mention is made regarding addressing data bias through techniques like stratification, oversampling, or undersampling. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based solely on the information available in the given context.
