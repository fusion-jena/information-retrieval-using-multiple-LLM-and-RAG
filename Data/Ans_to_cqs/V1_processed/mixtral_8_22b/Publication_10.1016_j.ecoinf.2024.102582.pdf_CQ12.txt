The given context does not provide information about the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It only mentions that a random forest algorithm was applied for rapid classification of land use types in the study area. Therefore, I cannot determine whether a convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), transformer, or any other deep learning model was employed in the process.
