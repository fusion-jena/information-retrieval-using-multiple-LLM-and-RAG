The given context does not provide explicit details about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some common techniques used to handle data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting is a technique where the dataset is divided into subsets or strata, ensuring each subset maintains the same distribution of classes as the original dataset. This approach can help prevent class imbalance issues during training and testing phases.

Oversampling involves duplicating samples from the minority class to achieve a more balanced dataset. Conversely, undersampling reduces the number of samples from the majority class to create a more balanced dataset. Both methods aim to mitigate the impact of class imbalances on model performance.

Diverse data collection focuses on gathering a wide range of examples representing different aspects of the problem domain. By collecting diverse data, it becomes possible to train models that generalize well across various scenarios and reduce potential biases introduced by limited or skewed datasets.
