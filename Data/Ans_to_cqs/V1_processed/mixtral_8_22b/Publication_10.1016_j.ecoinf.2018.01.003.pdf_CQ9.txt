The given text does not provide any specific information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that the experimental process map is randomly selected in Matlab (Fig. 6) and that data from 2014 and 2015 are used as the test dataset. There is no mention of any specific data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I do not know where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
