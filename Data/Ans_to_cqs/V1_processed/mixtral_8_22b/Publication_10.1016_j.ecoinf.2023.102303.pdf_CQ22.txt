The performance of the deep learning models in this study is evaluated using several metrics. These include Accuracy, Precision, F1-score, and AUC-ROC. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of the total number of instances. Precision, also known as Positive Predictive Value, is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, where recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the actual positives. Lastly, AUC-ROC stands for Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve, which plots True Positive Rate against False Positive Rate. It provides an aggregate measure of performance across all possible classification thresholds. Additionally, sensitivity, specificity, miss rate, and fall-out are mentioned as metrics to measure true and false classification probabilities. However, their definitions are not explicitly stated in the given context.
