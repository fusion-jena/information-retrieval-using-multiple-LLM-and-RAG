Based on the given context, it cannot be definitively determined what specific type of Deep Neural Network (DNN) model is being used in the pipeline. The text mentions that a search space of primary hyperparameters was defined and optimization algorithms were executed to find the highest accuracy from 1,788,160 hyperparameter combinations. It further states that three DNN architectures were found and used to build three models, which were then trained for the entire dataset for 1000 epochs. However, there is no explicit mention of the exact type of DNN model used, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. Therefore, based solely on the provided information, we cannot determine the precise type of deep learning model employed in the pipeline.
