The given context does not provide specific details about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotating, scaling, etc. However, it mentions some approaches that could potentially improve image classification tasks. These include incorporating information from online spectral libraries or other remote sensing products with more detailed spectral information and coarser spatial detail. Additionally, the text discusses the use of machine learning tools and human-in-the-loop classification methods to refine classifications. It also suggests using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for the four-band imagery to aid in classification. Nevertheless, without explicit mention of data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotation, or scaling, I cannot provide a definitive answer based on the given context.
