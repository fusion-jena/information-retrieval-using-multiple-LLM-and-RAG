To ensure the generalizability of the machine learning models, several measures were taken. Firstly, a diverse dataset was utilized, which included Planet satellite imagery data. This diversity in the dataset helped prevent overfitting and improved the model's ability to perform well on unseen data. Secondly, a 5-fold cross-validation grid search strategy was implemented to tune hyperparameters within the training dataset for all machine learning models. Cross-validation helps reduce bias and variance, making the model more robust and reliable. Lastly, the study mentions converting the canopy cover output percentage to a fraction (0â€“1), which could be considered a form of normalization or scaling. Normalizing input features can help improve the performance of some machine learning algorithms and contribute to better generalization.
