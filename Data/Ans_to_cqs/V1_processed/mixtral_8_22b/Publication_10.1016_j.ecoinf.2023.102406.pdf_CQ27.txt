The provided context does not contain any specific details regarding the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based solely on this context. However, generally speaking, after training a deep learning model, it can be deployed using various techniques such as model serialization, where the model is saved into a file format like.h5,.onnx, etc., and then loaded back during runtime. Another common method is platform selection, where the model is integrated into a web application, mobile app, or cloud service for real-time predictions. Other considerations include containerization, version control, and continuous integration/continuous delivery pipelines.
