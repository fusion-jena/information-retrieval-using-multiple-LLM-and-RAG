The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in their deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the context that they used image classification as part of their approach since they mention training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier. Image classification involves assigning labels to entire images rather than individual objects within them. Therefore, it is likely that the authors did not use bounding box annotations or instance segmentations, which are typically employed for object detection tasks. Instead, they might have simply labeled each image with its corresponding species name. Additionally, the context mentions that all images were center cropped to an equally sized rectangle, suggesting some form of preprocessing or normalization technique applied to the images before feeding them into the model.
