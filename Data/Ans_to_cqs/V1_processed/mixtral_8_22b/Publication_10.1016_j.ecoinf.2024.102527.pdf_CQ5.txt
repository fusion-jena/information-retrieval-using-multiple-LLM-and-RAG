The study uses three distinct datasets: ImageNet, Snapshot Serengeti (SS), and Lasha Mountain (LSM). ImageNet is a benchmark dataset in the field of computer vision, containing 1.2 million training samples across 1000 classes. The pre-trained model on ImageNet-1k is used as one of the source models for transfer learning. The SS and LSM datasets consist of camera trap images, where each capture event typically includes three images. These datasets maintain the integrity of events during data splitting by placing all images from an event into the same dataset.
