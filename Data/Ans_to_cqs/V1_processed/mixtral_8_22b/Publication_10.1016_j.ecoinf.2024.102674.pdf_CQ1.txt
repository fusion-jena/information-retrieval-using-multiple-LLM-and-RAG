The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the sources cited that the authors may have used publicly available datasets such as WorldClim 2 (Fick & Hijmans, 2017) or other climate databases like those mentioned in Hopkinson et al. (2012). These datasets often contain historical temperature records collected through various means such as weather stations, satellites, or other remote sensing technologies. Additionally, some studies might involve fieldwork to collect localized data using sensors or manual measurements. Nonetheless, without more detailed information regarding the study design or methodology, it is impossible to definitively state which methods were employed for gathering raw data in this particular case.
