The given context does not provide information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, generally speaking, there are several ways to collect raw data for deep learning applications. These include but are not limited to:

1. Surveys or Questionnaires: This method involves gathering data through direct interaction with individuals. It can be done online or offline and is often used when human insights are required.

2. Sensors: In various fields like IoT, robotics, autonomous vehicles, etc., sensor data is widely used. Sensors can capture real-time data, including visual, auditory, temperature, pressure, motion, etc.

3. Public Datasets: Many organizations and institutions release their datasets publicly for research purposes. These datasets cover a wide range of topics and can be very beneficial for training deep learning models. Examples include ImageNet for computer vision tasks, MNIST for handwritten digit recognition, etc.

4. Web Scraping: This technique involves automatically extracting large amounts of data from websites. It can be particularly useful when dealing with textual data.

5. APIs: Application Programming Interfaces allow developers to access data from different platforms and services. They can be used to gather data from social media, search engines, databases, etc.
