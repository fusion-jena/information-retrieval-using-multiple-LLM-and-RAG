The given context does not provide information about any specific deep learning pipelines or datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it discusses the use of the MOD13A2 dataset from the Google Earth Engine platform for acquiring NDVI data with a spatial resolution of 1 km and temporal resolution of 16 days. Additionally, twelve drivers related to climate, terrain, and human activity were also considered in this study. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline based on the given context.
