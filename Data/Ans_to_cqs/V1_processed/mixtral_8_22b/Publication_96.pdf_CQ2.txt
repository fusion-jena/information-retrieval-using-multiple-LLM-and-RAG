In this study, the researchers used Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) satellite images as input data for their deep learning pipeline. These images are raster data format, specifically multispectral images consisting of eleven spectral bands with varying spatial resolutions. The researchers did not use any other types of data formats like audio or video in their deep learning pipeline. They also did not mention using any tabular data formats like CSV files. Therefore, the only data format used in this study's deep learning pipeline is raster data format, specifically multispectral satellite images from Landsat 8 OLI.
