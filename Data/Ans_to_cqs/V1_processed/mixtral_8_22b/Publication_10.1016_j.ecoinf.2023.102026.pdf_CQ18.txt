The study uses both generalized linear models (GLMs) and random forests (RFs) for species distribution modeling of Southeast Asian felids. To monitor the performance of these models during training, they use different strategies depending on the type of model.

For the non-bootstrapped GLM, they calculate various evaluation metrics such as Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC), Percent Correctly Classified (PCC), sensitivity, specificity, and True Skill Statistic (TSS) using the remaining 20% of the camera trap locations not included in the training dataset. This allows them to assess how well the model can predict the occurrence of felids based on the environmental variables considered.

On the other hand, for the bootstrapped GLM, they perform 100 iterations of model training with different subsets of the data. After each iteration, they calculate the same set of evaluation metrics (AUC, PCC, sensitivity, specificity, and TSS) using the data retained from the model training, which consists of 80% of both presence and absence locations. The final evaluation metrics are then obtained by averaging the results of all 100 iterations. This approach helps ensure that the model is robust and reliable even when dealing with different subsets of the data.

In summary, the authors implement a comprehensive monitoring strategy to track the performance of their species distribution models during training. They use multiple evaluation metrics and consider both non-bootstrapped and bootstrapped versions of the GLM to ensure the reliability and accuracy of their predictions.
