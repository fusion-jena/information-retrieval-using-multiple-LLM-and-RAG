The text does not provide explicit information about specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it mentions segmentation and classification strategies used in eCognition, which can be considered part of image preprocessing. These strategies involve automatic selection of segmentation parameters and use of machine learning techniques for image classification. Additionally, the text highlights the importance of supervision and validation using other data sources during this process. While these steps might not directly correspond to traditional preprocessing tasks like normalization or scaling, they contribute to preparing the input data for further processing or analysis.
