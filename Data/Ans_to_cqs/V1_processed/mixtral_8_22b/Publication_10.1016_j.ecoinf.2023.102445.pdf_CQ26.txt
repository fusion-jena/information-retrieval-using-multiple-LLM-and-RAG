The given context does not provide specific details about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some common techniques used to handle data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting is a technique where the dataset is split into training and testing sets such that they maintain the same class proportions as in the original dataset. Oversampling is a method where the minority class samples are duplicated or synthetically generated to balance the classes. Undersampling is another approach where majority class samples are randomly removed to achieve balanced classes. Lastly, diverse data collection aims to gather more representative data from various sources to reduce bias.

These methods can be employed individually or combined depending on the nature and extent of the data bias present in the dataset. Proper application of these techniques helps mitigate data bias and improves the performance and generalizability of deep learning models.
