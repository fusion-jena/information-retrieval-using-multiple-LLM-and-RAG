Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that CLIP was trained on 400 million images from the web along with their captions. Additionally, it discusses the use of dataset imbalance and how it was dealt with by including class weights in the cross-entropy loss function. But no explicit mention of any standard datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet is found in the provided context.
