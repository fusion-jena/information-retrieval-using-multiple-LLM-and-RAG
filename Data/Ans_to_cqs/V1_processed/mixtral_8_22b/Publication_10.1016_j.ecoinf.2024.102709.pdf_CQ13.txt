While the given context does not explicitly mention the learning rate or the optimizer used in the deep learning model, it does provide information about some of the hyperparameters employed. Specifically, the model uses k-fold cross-validation with k=5, epochs=500, and image size=640 pixels. Epochs refer to the number of times the algorithm will work through the entire training dataset, while the image size specifies the resolution of the input images. These parameters help tune the performance of the model during training. However, without additional context, I cannot provide further details regarding the learning rate or the optimizer used in this particular case.
