The given context does not provide information on the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. The text mentions the use of random forest classification and machine learning techniques but does not specify whether a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer model is employed. Therefore, based on the available information, it cannot be determined what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline.
