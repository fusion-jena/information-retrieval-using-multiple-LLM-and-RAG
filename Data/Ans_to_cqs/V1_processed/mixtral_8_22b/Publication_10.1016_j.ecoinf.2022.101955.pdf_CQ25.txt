The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is classification. Specifically, it is used for land use and land cover (LULC) classification. This is evident from the statement, "In classifying with the MLP ANN model..." where MLP stands for Multilayer Perceptron, a type of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) commonly used for classification tasks. Furthermore, the output layer of the model has eight neurons, representing eight different LULC classes. Therefore, the goal of this deep learning model is to accurately categorize each pixel or region of interest into one of these eight LULC classes.
