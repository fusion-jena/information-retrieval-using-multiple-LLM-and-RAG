In the given context, the optimization of the hyperparameters of the model is mentioned briefly. According to the text, the constants alpha, beta, and gamma are determined using a grid search operation. Grid search is a type of exhaustive search that involves specifying a set of values for each parameter being tuned, and evaluating the model on every possible combination of those values. In other words, it systematically searches through a manually specified subset of a hyperparameter space of a learning algorithm. Therefore, in this case, the hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a grid search operation.
