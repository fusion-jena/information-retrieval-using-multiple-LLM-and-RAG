The text does not provide explicit information about specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it discusses several strategies employed to optimize the performance of a deep learning network for underwater object detection.

One strategy mentioned involves reducing computational complexity through the use of dilated convolution and depthwise separable convolution. Dilated convolution increases the receptive field of the convolution kernel without adding parameters or increasing computational load. Depthwise separable convolution reduces computation by performing spatial convolution independently for each input channel before applying pointwise convolution.

Additionally, modifications were made to the original YOLOv8 network to address issues related to capturing accurate feature information and recognizing objects of various sizes. A new LKSP module was proposed to replace the SPPF module, which included designing three large kernel convolution branches to increase the network's receptive field. This allowed the network to perceive a wider range within the image and better recognize objects of different sizes.

While these strategies contribute to improving the performance and efficiency of the deep learning network, they do not directly correspond to traditional optimization techniques like SGD or Adam. Instead, they focus on architectural changes aimed at enhancing feature extraction and recognition capabilities while minimizing computational overhead.
