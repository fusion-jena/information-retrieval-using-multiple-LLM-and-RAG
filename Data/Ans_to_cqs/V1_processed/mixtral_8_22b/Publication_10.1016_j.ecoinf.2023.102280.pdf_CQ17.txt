The text does not explicitly mention any specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses some general aspects related to deep learning-based denoising methods, particularly those using U-Net architectures and transformer attention mechanisms.

In general, there are several regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. Dropout is one popular method where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps reduce interdependent learning among them. Another technique is L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, which adds a penalty term to the loss function based on the square of the magnitude of all weights in the network. Other methods include early stopping, data augmentation, and batch normalization.

While these regularization methods are not mentioned specifically in the given context, they could potentially be employed in the deep learning-based denoising methods discussed in the text to improve their performance and avoid overfitting.
