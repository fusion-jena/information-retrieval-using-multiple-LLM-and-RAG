Based on the given context, there is no information about which specific frameworks were used to build the deep learning model. The context only mentions the use of various statistical computing environments such as R and different machine learning algorithms like GLM, MaxEnt, RF, GBM, and MARS. However, it does not provide any details regarding the use of deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, I cannot determine which frameworks were used to build the deep learning model based on the available context.
