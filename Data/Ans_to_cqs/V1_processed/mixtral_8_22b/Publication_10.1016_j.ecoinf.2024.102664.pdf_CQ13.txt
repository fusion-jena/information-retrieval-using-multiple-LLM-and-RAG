Based on the given information, it appears that the deep learning models used in this study include CNN, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM. However, the specific hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizers used for each model are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

From Table 1, we can see that three different optimizers - Adam, SGDM, and RMSProp - have been used for training the networks. But the exact learning rates associated with these optimizers are not specified. Similarly, the input time series lengths for the models are listed as 3 days, 7 days, and unspecified (represented by 'A', 'B', and 'C'), but other crucial hyperparameters like batch size, epochs, or weight initialization methods are not mentioned.

Therefore, based on the available context, I cannot provide detailed information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning models. It would be necessary to refer to additional resources or documentation related to this study to find out more about the specific hyperparameter settings employed.
