The authors of the paper employ several techniques to mitigate potential biases in their deep learning pipeline. One approach they take is to apply a five-fold subject-exclusive (SE) strategy when dividing their dataset into training and testing subsets. This method ensures that the same individual does not appear in both the training and testing sets simultaneously, thereby preventing any potential bias towards specific subjects.

To tackle the issue of class imbalance, the researchers implement aggressive data augmentation techniques. By applying various transformations like horizontal flipping to their original images, they aim to create a more balanced distribution across different classes or categories within their dataset.

Additionally, the authors mention using diverse data collection methods, although no further details are given regarding how this diversity is achieved. Nonetheless, collecting data from varied sources can help ensure that the resulting dataset represents a broader range of scenarios, reducing the risk of overfitting to a particular subset of examples.

In summary, the authors utilize a combination of stratified splitting, data augmentation, and potentially diverse data collection to minimize data bias during the preprocessing stage of their deep learning pipeline.
