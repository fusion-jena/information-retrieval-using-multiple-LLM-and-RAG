The information provided does not contain any details about data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. Data augmentation is a strategy that enables practitioners to significantly increase the diversity of training examples available for a machine learning model, without actually collecting new data. Commonly used data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, padding, and zooming. However, based on the given context, it cannot be determined which specific techniques have been applied in this case.
