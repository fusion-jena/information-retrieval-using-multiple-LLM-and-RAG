The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model. However, it is common practice in deep learning applications to perform various preprocessing techniques such as image resizing, normalization, augmentation, or noise reduction depending on the nature of the input data. In this case, since the datasets consist of images, some possible preprocessing steps could include converting color images to grayscale, rescaling pixel values to a certain range (like [0, 1] or [-1, 1]), applying histogram equalization, or performing geometric transformations like rotation, flipping, or cropping. Additionally, if there are missing or corrupted images in the dataset, they may be removed or replaced with alternative data points. It should also be noted that the choice of preprocessing technique depends on factors such as computational resources available, desired level of complexity, and the characteristics of the target task.
