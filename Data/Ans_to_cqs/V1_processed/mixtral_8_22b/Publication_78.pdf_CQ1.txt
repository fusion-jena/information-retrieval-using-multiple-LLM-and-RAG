The text does not provide explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that an image is initially taken with the help of an underwater drone. This suggests that one possible method for collecting raw data could be using underwater drones equipped with cameras to capture images of coral reefs. Additionally, the paper references other works that use hyperspectral bottom index imagery and deep convolutional neural networks like VGG-19 for bottom-type classification in coral reef areas. These methods may require large amounts of labeled data for training, which could potentially come from publicly available datasets or manual labeling efforts. Overall, while the exact methods for collecting raw data are not explicitly stated, the text implies that various techniques such as underwater drones, hyperspectral imagery, and publicly available datasets could be employed depending on the specific application and requirements of the deep learning pipeline.
