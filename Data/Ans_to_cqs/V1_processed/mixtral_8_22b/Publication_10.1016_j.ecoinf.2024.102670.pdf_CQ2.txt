The text does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the data format used is likely image data. This is because the study focuses on applying deep learning techniques to fungal images and chromosome images. Additionally, the use of filters such as the 2nd-order Gaussian filter suggests that the input data is in the form of images. Therefore, it can be concluded that the data format used in this deep learning pipeline is primarily image data.
