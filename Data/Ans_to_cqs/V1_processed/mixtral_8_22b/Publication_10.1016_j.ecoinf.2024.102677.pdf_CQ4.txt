The text does not provide explicit information about the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for promoting a deeper understanding of rural landscapes. However, common data augmentation techniques often applied in deep learning include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, zooming, shearing, and brightness adjustment. These techniques help increase the size and diversity of training datasets by creating modified versions of existing images, thereby enhancing the robustness and generalization capabilities of the models.
