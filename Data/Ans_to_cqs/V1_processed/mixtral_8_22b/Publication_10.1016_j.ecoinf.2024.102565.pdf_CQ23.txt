The study ensured the generalizability of its deep learning models by implementing several measures during the validation phase. Firstly, a K-fold cross-validation technique was used, specifically setting K to four. This approach differs from traditional methods that separate data into distinct sets, as it maximizes the use of both on-site and remote sensing datasets by incorporating them into both training and validation phases.

Moreover, a four-fold cross-validation was performed on the training dataset. The feature set was randomly split into four mutually exclusive folds via stratified sampling. Each fold functioned as the validation set, while the remaining three formed the training set for model training. To tackle class imbalance issues, random undersampling (RUS) was applied to the training set, leaving the validation set untouched. The model was then trained using the balanced three-fold training dataset for a certain number of epochs before being evaluated on the validation fold to yield predictions for that particular fold. This procedure was repeated four times with unique validation sets.

In terms of model selection, neural networks (NN) were chosen due to their versatility and widespread application in various tasks such as classification and regression. Neural networks consist of interconnected nodes called neurons arranged in layers, which process and transform input data to generate desired outputs. In this study, only wind speed was considered as the input feature.

Additionally, Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) was employed, denoted as f(x) ~ GP(m(x), k(x, x')). GPR is a nonparametric probabilistic model capable of handling high dimensionality and noise in data. It provides not only point estimates but also insights into prediction uncertainty. Hyperparameters in GPR are determined from the data using techniques like maximum likelihood estimation or Bayesian approaches, catering to diverse datasets with different levels of complexity.
