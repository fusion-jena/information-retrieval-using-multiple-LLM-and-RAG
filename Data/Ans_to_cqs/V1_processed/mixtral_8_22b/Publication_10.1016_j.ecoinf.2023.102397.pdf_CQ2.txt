The information provided does not explicitly state what type of data format is used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the study involves processing acoustic data related to bird songs. Therefore, it would be reasonable to assume that the data format used in this case is likely audio files containing bird sounds.
