The data and codes created in the research are available at <https://github.com/RyokoNod/sdm-asian-elephants>. Additionally, for informally exploring all outputs of models, an interactive map is available at <https://miro.mind.com/app/board/uXjVOX_Zhf8=/>. However, it should be noted that these links do not appear to be direct repositories like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Instead, they seem to lead to GitHub and Miro, which are platforms often used for sharing code and visualizations respectively.
