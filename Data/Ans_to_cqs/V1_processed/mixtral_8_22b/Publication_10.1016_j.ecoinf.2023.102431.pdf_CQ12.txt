The text does not mention any specific deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers being used in the pipeline. Instead, it describes the use of a predictor screening analysis that employs bootstrap forest partitioning to evaluate the contribution of predictors on the response object. This method involves building 1000 decision trees to evaluate all 124 potential FIT metrics. After selecting the top predictor variables, linear discriminant analysis is used to generate a discrimination line or hyperplane, depending on the number of variables in the resulting model, to classify species or sex. Uncertainty in classification is quantified by generating bands of uncertainty around this discrimination hyperplane. A logistic regression model is then applied to assign probabilities to values within these bands, indicating a level of certainty about the classification. Therefore, no specific deep learning model appears to be mentioned in the given context.
