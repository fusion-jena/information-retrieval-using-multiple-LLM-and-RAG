The text does not provide explicit information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the YOLO DCNN was initialized with pretrained weights from the COCO dataset provided by Redmon & Farhadi (2018). Additionally, the authors note that the availability of large image training datasets like the COCO dataset has contributed to advancements in deep learning techniques. Therefore, while the exact datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not specified, it is known that the COCO dataset was utilized.
