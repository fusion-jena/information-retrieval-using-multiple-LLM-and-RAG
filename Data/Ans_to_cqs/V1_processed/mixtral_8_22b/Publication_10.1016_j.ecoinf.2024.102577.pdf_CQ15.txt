The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that some form of optimization technique is likely being employed due to the presence of machine learning methods mentioned throughout the sources. For instance, Platt (1998) discusses fast training of support vector machines using sequential minimal optimization, which is a type of optimization algorithm. Additionally, Hall (2000) mentions correlation-based feature selection, which could involve optimization techniques such as genetic algorithms or simulated annealing. Nevertheless, without more specific details regarding the deep learning pipeline, it cannot be definitively stated what optimization techniques are being utilized.
