The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in this study is semantic segmentation. Specifically, it aims to detect water sun glint in UAV water images. The authors propose a new network called Res_AUNet, which is based on the UNet architecture but enhanced with additional components such as the Convolutional Block Attention Module and residual structures. The goal is to improve the ability of the network to accurately identify areas affected by water sun glint, which can negatively impact the quality of UAV imagery. The Res_AUNet network was trained and tested using the WSGD dataset, achieving high levels of accuracy, precision, recall, and intersection over union (IOU). It outperformed several other popular semantic segmentation networks, including UNet, UNet++, PSPNet, and HRNet. Overall, the main objective of this research is to develop a more effective method for identifying and removing water sun glint from UAV water images, thereby improving their usefulness for various applications.
