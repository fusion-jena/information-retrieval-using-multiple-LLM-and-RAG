The given context does not provide specific details about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the deep learning algorithms were trained using large-scale data to obtain deeply hidden characteristic information and features. It also discusses the use of adaptive strategies to modulate the learning rate to improve the neural network convergence rate. Unfortunately, without more specific information, we cannot determine which datasets were used in this particular study or deep learning pipeline. Some commonly used datasets in deep learning include MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet, but these are not mentioned explicitly in the provided context.
