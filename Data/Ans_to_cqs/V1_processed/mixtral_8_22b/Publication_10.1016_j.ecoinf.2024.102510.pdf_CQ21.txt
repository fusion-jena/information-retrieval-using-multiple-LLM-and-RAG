Based on the given context, it appears that there are several postprocessing steps involved after the model training. After generating classifiers using pre-trained models and retraining them to extract features through transfer learning, the optimal number of convolutional base layers to be retrained is determined during the fine-tuning process. Hyperparameters Optimization Search (HHOS) is utilized to find the best hyperparameter values. Once the models have been trained with the optimal hyperparameter values, they are evaluated using the validation dataset.

Additionally, the average accuracy of pre-trained models is assessed across three different train-test partitions both before and after data augmentation. The performance of these models is also compared to other existing methods. It seems that the performance evaluation is implemented in MATLAB R2021a on a specific workstation.

However, based solely on this information, we cannot determine if saliency maps, confusion matrices, or any other specific postprocessing steps such as those mentioned in the query are explicitly included in the described pipeline. Therefore, while there are certainly postprocessing steps involved after the model training, without more detailed information about the exact procedures followed, we cannot provide a definitive list of all the postprocessing steps performed in this case.
