In the given context, two types of deep learning models are mentioned: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Autoencoder. However, there is no explicit mention of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers.

The main focus of the text is on the use of an MLP for the classification of fish events. This MLP consists of four fully connected layers with sizes 256, 128, 64, and 12. Each layer includes a linear layer followed by PRelu as non-linearity, except for the third layer, which is provided with Batch Normalization. The network receives an input of size 512, consisting of learned features extracted from a diffusion model, and its final layer contains 12 neurons. The maximum neuron value from this layer is used for predicting the event class.

Additionally, the context mentions using an Autoencoder model to extract latent representations before feeding them into the MLP for classification. However, the specific architecture of the Autoencoder is not detailed.

Therefore, based on the provided information, the primary deep learning models used in the described pipeline are the MLP and Autoencoder. There is no clear indication of the use of CNN, RNN, or Transformer models.
