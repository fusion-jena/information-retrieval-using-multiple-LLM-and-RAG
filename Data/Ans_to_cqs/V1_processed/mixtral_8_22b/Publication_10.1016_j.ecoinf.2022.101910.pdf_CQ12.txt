The text mentions that BirdNET uses a deep neural network for the automated detection and classification of bird vocalizations from sound recordings. However, it does not explicitly specify the exact type of deep learning model used in the pipeline, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. Therefore, based on the given information, I am unable to provide a definitive answer regarding the specific type of deep learning model employed in the BirdNET pipeline.
