The text does not provide explicit information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions using three datasets: ImageNet, Snapshot Serengeti (SS), and Lasha Mountain (LSM). It also discusses how the data from these datasets were split for use in transfer learning experiments.

From the given context, we can infer that the ImageNet dataset is a benchmark dataset in the field of computer vision, containing manually annotated images of varying sizes. The study uses the pre-trained model on the ImageNet-1k dataset as one of the source models for transfer learning.

Regarding the SS and LSM datasets, they are both described as camera trap image datasets. Camera traps are remotely activated cameras often used in wildlife monitoring and conservation studies. These devices automatically take pictures when motion is detected, allowing researchers to collect large amounts of data without constant human presence.

In summary, while the text does not explicitly state the methods used for collecting raw data, it implies that the ImageNet dataset consists of manually annotated images, whereas the SS and LSM datasets contain images captured by camera traps.
