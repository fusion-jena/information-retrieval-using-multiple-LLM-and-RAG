The given context does not mention any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The focus of the text is on predicting Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Significant Wave Height (SWH) using various models including a combination of gated recurrent units (GRU) and regular neural network. Therefore, it cannot be determined what data annotation techniques were used in the deep learning pipeline based solely on the provided information.
