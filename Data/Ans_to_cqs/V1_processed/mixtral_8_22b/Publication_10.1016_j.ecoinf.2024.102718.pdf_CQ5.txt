The text mentions the use of the Dhan-Shomadhan dataset, which seems to be a custom or specific dataset not widely known outside this particular study. It is described as a large-scale image dataset, but no further details about its origin or contents are given. Unfortunately, there is no mention of other commonly used datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
