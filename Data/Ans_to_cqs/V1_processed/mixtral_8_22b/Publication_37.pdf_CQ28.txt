Unfortunately, there is not enough information provided in the given context to determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. The context only mentions that the authors explored two state-of-the-art classification techniques for large vocabulary bird species classification from flight calls: a shallow learning unsupervised dictionary learning method and a deep convolutional neural network combined with data augmentation. They evaluated these models on a dataset of 5428 flight calls from 43 different species and compared them against a baseline model based on MFCCs. However, it does not mention any details about the deployment or implementation of these models. Therefore, it is impossible to provide an accurate answer to the query based solely on the given context.
