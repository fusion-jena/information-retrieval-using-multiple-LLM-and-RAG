The papers cited do not directly address the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model mentioned in the query. However, common metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, and Area Under Curve (AUC). Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of total predictions made. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made. Recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of actual positives. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve plots True Positive Rate against False Positive Rate, while the Area Under Curve (AUC) represents the degree or measure of separability between classes. These metrics can be used individually or in combination to assess the performance of a deep learning model.
