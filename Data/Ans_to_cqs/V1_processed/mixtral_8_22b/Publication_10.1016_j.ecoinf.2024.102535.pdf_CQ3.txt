In the given context, there isn't explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does mention manual annotation of seabed images, which could potentially involve various annotation methods depending on the task requirements.

Manual annotation involves human experts labeling the data, often using tools like bounding boxes, polygons, or pixel-wise masks to identify objects or regions of interest within images. This process can be time-consuming and subjective, leading to potential inconsistencies between annotators.

While not explicitly stated, the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), specifically variants of the VGG network, suggests that the dataset may consist of labeled images used for object recognition tasks. CNNs are commonly employed for image classification, detection, and segmentation tasks, requiring appropriate annotations based on the problem at hand.

Given the lack of concrete details regarding the specific annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it would be speculative to provide further insights into the exact methodologies utilized. Nonetheless, it is reasonable to infer that some form of manual annotation was involved in preparing the dataset for training and evaluating the deep learning models discussed in the context.
