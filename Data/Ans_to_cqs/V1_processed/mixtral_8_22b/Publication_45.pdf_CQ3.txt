The given context does not provide explicit information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on common practices in deep learning, some popular data annotation techniques include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest in images or videos. Semantic segmentation entails labeling each pixel in an image with its corresponding class or category. Instance segmentation combines both object detection and semantic segmentation, where individual instances of objects are identified and labeled separately. Other techniques like polygon annotation, key-point annotation, and landmark annotation can be employed depending on the specific requirements of the project.
