The papers referenced do not provide specific information about the evaluation metrics used to measure the performance of their deep learning models. Halgamuge et al. (2020) mentioned developing an algorithm to automatically collect data and analyzing six different optimizer models using deep learning technology but did not specify any particular metric for evaluating these models. Similarly, Dowdy (2020) discussed a seasonal prediction system for wildfire event prediction in Australia without mentioning any specific evaluation metrics. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the exact metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models in these studies.
