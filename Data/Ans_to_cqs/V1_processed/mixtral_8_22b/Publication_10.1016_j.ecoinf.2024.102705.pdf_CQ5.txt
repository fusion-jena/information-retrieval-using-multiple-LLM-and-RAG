Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific details about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that deep learning models use extensive datasets for training feature extractors. It also highlights that Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) have been extensively utilized for image processing tasks, such as extracting ecological information from camera trap images. This suggests that the datasets used could be related to these applications, but without explicit mention, it remains speculative.
