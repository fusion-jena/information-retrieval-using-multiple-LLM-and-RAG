A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was used in the pipeline. Specifically, a ResNet50 model, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, was employed. This model was chosen due to its ability to learn various image features, which can be effectively adapted for spectrogram classification tasks. Despite previous studies suggesting improved performance with multiple CNN models, a single ResNet50 model was selected for prediction efficiency and manageable memory requirements.
