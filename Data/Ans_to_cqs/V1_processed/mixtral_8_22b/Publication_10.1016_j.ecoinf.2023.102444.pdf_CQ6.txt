Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be taken to improve its performance. These may include:

* Normalization or standardization: This involves rescaling the values of features so they fall within a specific range, often between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. This helps prevent any one feature from dominating the others due to differences in scale.
* Scaling: Similar to normalization, scaling involves adjusting the values of features to bring them into a common range. However, unlike normalization, scaling does not necessarily involve bringing all values into a fixed range. Instead, it might involve multiplying all values by a constant factor.
* Cleaning: This step involves removing or correcting errors, outliers, or missing values in the dataset. For example, if there are missing values in some rows of the dataset, these could be filled in using various imputation methods. Similarly, if there are outliers present in the dataset, these could be removed or replaced with more typical values.
* Feature engineering: This step involves creating new features or transformations of existing features that might help improve the performance of the model. For example, polynomial features or interaction terms could be created to better capture nonlinear relationships between features.
* Data augmentation: In cases where the amount of available training data is limited, data augmentation techniques can be used to artificially increase the size of the dataset. For example, images could be rotated, flipped, or cropped to create new variations of the same image.
