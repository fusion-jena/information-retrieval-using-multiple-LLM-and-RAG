The text does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on common practices in deep learning applications related to object detection and segmentation, we can infer that some potential techniques might include bounding box annotation and instance segmentation.

Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest in images or video frames. These boxes help the deep learning algorithm identify and locate the desired objects. For example, in the case of fish biomass estimation, bounding boxes would likely be drawn around individual fish instances in each frame.

Instance segmentation is another technique that goes beyond mere localization and also separates individual objects from one another. It involves creating pixel-level masks for each object instance, allowing the deep learning algorithm to distinguish between overlapping or closely packed objects. Instance segmentation may prove particularly useful when dealing with dense fish populations or environments with significant occlusion.

In summary, while the exact data annotation techniques employed in the described deep learning pipeline remain unknown, it is reasonable to assume that bounding box annotation and instance segmentation could potentially be utilized due to their relevance in similar applications involving object detection and segmentation tasks.
