Based on the given context, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using the Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) metric for evaluation. Specifically, the MOTA of the Sort model was compared to that of the Deep Sort model using Feature Extraction Networks (FENs). It was observed that the MOTA of the Sort model was significantly lower than that of the Deep Sort model using FENs. Additionally, the number of Identification (ID) allocations made by the Sort model exceeded those made by the Deep Sort model, indicating that the FEN network extracted more and richer target information features during the tracking process. Therefore, it appears that the use of FENs in conjunction with the Deep Sort algorithm was employed to enhance the model's ability to accurately detect and identify targets within complex scenes containing high dynamic densities and low training data. Furthermore, future work aims to optimize the detection model and implement migration learning during training to further improve detection accuracy.
