The papers mentioned in the given context do not explicitly state the specific datasets used in their deep learning pipelines. However, they discuss various approaches to wildfire event prediction in Australia using deep learning technology. Halgamuge et al. (2020) focus on selecting the best optimizers for wildfire event predictions using deep learning, while Dowdy (2020) presents a seasonal prediction system for wildfire events. Both studies use historical environmental conditions and spatial-temporal variations to train their models.

Additionally, the text mentions extracting 97 images from April 2013 to July 2021 using the Code Editor tool. These images were then analyzed to calculate mean NDVI scores and record the percentage of vegetation with low NDVI scores. The resulting dataset includes the mean NDVI score, the month and date when each image was taken, and forest vulnerability as the percentage of vegetation with low NDVI scores. Some images were excluded due to inaccuracies or lack of NDVI estimates and cloud coverage. Data was also collected during major wildfire events between September 2019 and January 2020.

However, it is important to note that none of the information provided specifies the exact datasets used in the deep learning pipelines. Therefore, based on the available context, we cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the datasets used in the deep learning pipelines.
