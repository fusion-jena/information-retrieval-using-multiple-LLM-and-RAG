Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does state that they extracted relevant features of birds from their endemic bird data which implies some form of feature extraction or labeling may have been performed prior to training the Inception-ResNet-v2 model. Without further information about how these features were extracted or labeled, I cannot provide more details regarding the specific data annotation techniques used in this study.
