Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, the authors do discuss normalizing all input channels (red, green, blue, and depth) by subtracting the respective mean and dividing by the respective standard deviation over the whole dataset. This technique can help mitigate some forms of data bias by ensuring that each channel has equal importance and preventing any single channel from dominating the model's decision-making process due to its magnitude. Additionally, the authors use weights pre-trained on the Microsoft COCO dataset for the region proposal network (RPN) classifier and mask head, which could potentially help address biases present in their own dataset if the COCO dataset is more balanced or representative.
