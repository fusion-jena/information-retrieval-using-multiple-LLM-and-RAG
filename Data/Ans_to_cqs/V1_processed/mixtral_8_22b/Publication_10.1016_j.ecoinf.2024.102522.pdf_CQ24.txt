The query asks about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, specifically regarding random seed values. However, based on the given context, there isn't any information directly related to this topic. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer using only the provided context.

Generally speaking, though, some common strategies used to manage randomness in deep learning pipelines include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, employing techniques like cross-validation or bootstrapping to reduce variance, and using ensemble methods to combine multiple models trained with different initializations. These strategies help mitigate the impact of randomness and improve model performance and reliability.
