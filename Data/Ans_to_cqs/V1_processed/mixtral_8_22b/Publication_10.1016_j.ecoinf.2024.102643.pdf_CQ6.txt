The text does not provide specific information on the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, common preprocessing steps include normalization, which scales numeric variables to a standard scale, typically between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1; scaling, which rescales the input features to have zero mean and unit variance; and cleaning, which involves handling missing values, outliers, and irrelevant data. These steps help improve the model's performance and convergence speed during training.
