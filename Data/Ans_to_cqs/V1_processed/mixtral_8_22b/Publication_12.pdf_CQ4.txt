The text does not provide explicit details about the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the size of the images was reduced from 256*256 pixels to 64*64 pixels to save training time and reduce high memory graphics use. Additionally, it is mentioned that signals were rescaled exponentially, and windows were shifted slightly either side of the call to change background noise. These could be considered as part of the data augmentation process. Unfortunately, there is no mention of flipping, rotating, or scaling as data augmentation techniques in the given context.
