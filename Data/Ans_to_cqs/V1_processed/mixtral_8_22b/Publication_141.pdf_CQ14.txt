The text does not provide explicit information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, it does mention that the authors chose to use a ResNet-50 network architecture, which suggests they may have experimented with various architectures before selecting one. Additionally, the text discusses using transfer learning, data augmentation, and dropout techniques, indicating some form of optimization process took place. Unfortunately, without more specific details about the optimization methods employed, such as whether grid search, random search, or another method was used, we cannot definitively state how the hyperparameters were optimized.
