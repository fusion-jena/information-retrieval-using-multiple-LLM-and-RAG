Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it can be inferred that the dataset was split into training and testing sets in an 8:2 ratio, which could potentially help mitigate bias by ensuring both sets have similar distributions. Additionally, the use of multiple features (F1, F2, F3, etc.) and their combinations (F4⊕F5⊕F6, F4⊕F5⊕F6⊕F7) might also contribute to reducing potential biases in the data. Nevertheless, without further information regarding the nature of the data and its distribution, it cannot be definitively stated whether these measures effectively addressed data bias.
