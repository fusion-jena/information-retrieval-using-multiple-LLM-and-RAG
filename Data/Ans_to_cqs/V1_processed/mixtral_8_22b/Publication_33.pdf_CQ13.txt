The text does not provide explicit information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the optimizer. However, it mentions that a single parameter is used for all classes instead of the traditional softmax function to convert the vector output from the neural network into a real probability. Additionally, it discusses the use of a risk threshold Ï„i specific to each class, which is tuned during the second phase of training using a separate database. It also mentions that the training phase is supervised, indicating that the classes to be identified are pre-defined by human experts. Furthermore, it states that the parameters of the classifier are automatically optimized to accurately classify a "training" database. Based on these details, one could infer that some form of optimization algorithm was likely used, but without more specific information, it is impossible to determine exactly what hyperparameters were employed.
