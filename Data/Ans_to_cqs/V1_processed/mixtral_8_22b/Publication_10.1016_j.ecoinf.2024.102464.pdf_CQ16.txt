The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific criteria for determining when training is complete. However, based on common practices in machine learning, some possible criteria include reaching a validation loss plateau or achieving a desired level of accuracy or other performance metric on a separate validation dataset. In the given context, it can be inferred that the authors may have used similar criteria, such as monitoring the mean area under the curve (AUC) of training and test data during the implementation of their machine learning models. Nevertheless, without explicit information from the source material, we cannot definitively state what criteria they used to determine when training was complete.
