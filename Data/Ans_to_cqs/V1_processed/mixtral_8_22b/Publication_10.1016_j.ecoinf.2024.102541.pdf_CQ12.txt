The text does not explicitly mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it can be inferred that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are likely involved due to references to techniques such as Inception-v4, dense convolutional neural networks, and deep convolutional neural networks. Additionally, there are mentions of transformers meeting convolutional neural networks for plant disease classification, suggesting a possible combination or integration of these two types of models. Nonetheless, without explicit confirmation, it cannot be definitively stated what exact type of deep learning model is employed in the pipeline.
