The text mentions two main datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for semantic segmentation tasks. The first one is the COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset, which contains over 121,000 images and 883,000 labeled objects across 184 categories. It is a popular benchmark dataset for evaluating the performance of computer vision algorithms. The second dataset mentioned is the Harmonized Land Cover and Use Database for Field Surveys from 2006 to 2018 in the European Union, also known as the Lucas In-Situ dataset. This dataset provides information about land cover and use throughout Europe and can be useful for various applications related to remote sensing and environmental monitoring.
