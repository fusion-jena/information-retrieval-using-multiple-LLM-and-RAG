The text does not explicitly mention any specific techniques such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does describe a process that contributes to this goal. Data validation was performed using a holdback trial partitioning test on training sets for 44 captive Amur tigers. This involved iterating the analysis 10 times for each combination of test/training size, with randomly selected trails, to compare the predicted outcome with the known test set size. This process helps to evaluate the performance of the model under different conditions and ensures its robustness. Additionally, the fact that optimal classification accuracy was achieved when the test set size was smallest relative to the training set suggests that some form of balanced sampling might have been employed to prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize.
