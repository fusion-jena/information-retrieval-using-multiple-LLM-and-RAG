The context does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it is common practice in machine learning to use a random stratified sampling method to ensure that each set maintains similar proportions of classes or categories present in the original dataset. This helps prevent overfitting and ensures that the model generalizes well to unseen data. Additionally, the context mentions the importance of evaluating classification accuracy using real-world examples, which suggests that the authors may have considered splitting their data based on temporal or spatial factors relevant to bat identification in natural environments.
