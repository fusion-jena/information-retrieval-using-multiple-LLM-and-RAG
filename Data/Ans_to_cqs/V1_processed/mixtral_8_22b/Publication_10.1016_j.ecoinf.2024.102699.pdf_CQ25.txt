The purpose of the deep learning model is to classify 397 different bird species. The authors employed three fundamental deep neural network architectures, including vision transformers, for this task. They also integrated up to 19 well-established data augmentation techniques to enhance the accuracy and generalizability of their models. The main goal was to develop an automated system for monitoring avian biodiversity, which would reduce manual labor and require specialized expertise.
