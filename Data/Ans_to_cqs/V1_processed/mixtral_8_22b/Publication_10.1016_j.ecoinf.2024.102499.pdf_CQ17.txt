The text does not provide explicit information about specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, there is mention of a 5-fold cross-validation process, which is a technique used to reduce overfitting by evaluating the model's performance on different subsets of the data. Additionally, the authors note that they used a cosine learning rate decay, which can help prevent overfitting by gradually reducing the learning rate during training.
