Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model used for algal bloom forecasting in the Zhoushan fishery. However, it can be inferred that some form of validation was performed since evaluation metrics such as R2 and RMSE are presented. Additionally, the use of diverse datasets could also be implied through the utilization of different deep learning models like CNN, LSTM, and their combination (CNN-LSTM). Nevertheless, without further details regarding the methodology or experimental setup, it cannot be confirmed whether techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting were employed to enhance the model's generalizability.
