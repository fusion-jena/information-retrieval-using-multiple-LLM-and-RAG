The given context does not provide information about the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses various aspects of weakly supervised learning tasks in machine learning, including binary labels, distribution learning, and structural incompleteness. It also mentions a case study involving predictive modeling of global vegetation cover. Therefore, without additional context, it cannot be determined which data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline.
