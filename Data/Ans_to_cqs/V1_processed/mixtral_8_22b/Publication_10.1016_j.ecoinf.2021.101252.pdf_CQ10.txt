Unfortunately, based on the given information, there is no direct mention of a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in these case studies. It would be necessary to have more detailed information about the source of these case studies or any associated publications to provide a precise answer. However, considering the common practice in sharing research materials, especially in machine learning and deep learning fields, it might be worth checking popular repositories like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket for projects related to the mentioned authors, keywords, or methodologies. For instance, searching for 'Deep learning', 'ResNet', 'InceptionTime', 'LSTM', 'CNN', or author names such as 'M. Reichstein', 'G. Camps-Valls', etc., could potentially lead to relevant repositories containing the desired deep learning pipelines.
