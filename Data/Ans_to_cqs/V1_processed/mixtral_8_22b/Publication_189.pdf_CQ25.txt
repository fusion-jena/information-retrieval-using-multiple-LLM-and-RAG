The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is semantic segmentation and object detection. Specifically, it utilizes techniques such as Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) and Mask R-CNN, which combines elements of Faster R-CNN and FCNs for improved performance in tasks related to image segmentation and object detection. The primary goal of these models is to accurately identify and classify objects within images, as well as delineate their boundaries for precise localization.

In the case of semantic segmentation, the model aims to assign a specific label or category to each pixel in an input image, effectively creating a detailed map of the scene depicted. This can be particularly useful in applications such as autonomous driving, medical imaging analysis, and satellite image interpretation.

On the other hand, object detection focuses on identifying instances of predefined classes within an image and determining their locations through bounding boxes. By incorporating Mask R-CNN into the model, it not only detects objects but also generates accurate masks around them, providing more granular information about their shapes and sizes. This capability is valuable in various domains, including surveillance systems, facial recognition software, and industrial quality control processes.

Overall, the deep learning model described in the given context serves multiple purposes related to computer vision tasks, primarily focusing on semantic segmentation and object detection with enhanced precision due to its integration of advanced techniques like FCNs and Mask R-CNN.
