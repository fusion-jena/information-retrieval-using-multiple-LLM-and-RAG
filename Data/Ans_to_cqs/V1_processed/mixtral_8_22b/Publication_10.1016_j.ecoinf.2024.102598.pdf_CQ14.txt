In the given context, there is no explicit mention of how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, such as through techniques like grid search or random search. However, it does state that the authors utilized the recommended parameters for all Maximum Likelihood Models (MLMs) except for Random Forest (RF). In the case of RF, they explicitly set the number of trees to 500 as an additional parameter. It can be inferred that some form of optimization might have been performed beforehand to determine the recommended parameters for each MLM. Nonetheless, without specific details about the optimization process, one cannot definitively conclude which method was used.
