In this study, the authors did not explicitly mention the specific data annotation technique they employed for their deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, we can infer that they likely utilized some form of object detection or classification annotation methodology.

This is because the authors mentioned using a GoogLeNet architecture, which is designed for image classification tasks. They also stated that they aimed to annotate at least 2200 thumbnails per fish species class, indicating that they were working with labeled datasets for supervised learning purposes.

Additionally, the authors listed several criteria for annotating fishes, such as annotating only if the fish covers no more than 10% of another object, if the fish can be identified at the species level within the frame, and if the apparent size of the fish is larger than 3000 square pixels. These criteria suggest that the authors may have been performing manual annotations, possibly involving bounding boxes around individual fish instances.

However, without explicit confirmation from the authors regarding the exact data annotation technique used, we cannot definitively state whether they employed bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, or any other specific method.
