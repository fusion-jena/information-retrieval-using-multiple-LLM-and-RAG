The given context does not provide specific information about the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, zooming, shearing, and brightness adjustment. These techniques help increase the size of the training set and improve the generalization performance of a model. It is important to note that the choice of data augmentation technique depends on the nature of the problem being solved and the characteristics of the input data. For instance, in the case of image data, geometric transformations such as flipping, rotation, and scaling can be useful, while for time series data, techniques like jittering and scaling might be more appropriate. Without further details about the specific deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context, it is impossible to determine which data augmentation techniques were applied.
