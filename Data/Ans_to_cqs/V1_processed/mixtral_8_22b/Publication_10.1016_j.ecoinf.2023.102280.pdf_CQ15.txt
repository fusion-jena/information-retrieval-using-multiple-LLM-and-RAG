The given context does not provide specific details about the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that a pre-trained CMGAN model was fine-tuned using a maximum of 1000 five-second noisy and clean samples. The default training parameters mentioned include a learning rate of 5e-4 and learning rate decay after the first 30 epochs. While these are hyperparameters related to the optimization process, they do not explicitly mention the use of any particular optimization technique like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, RMSprop, etc. Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot definitively identify the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
