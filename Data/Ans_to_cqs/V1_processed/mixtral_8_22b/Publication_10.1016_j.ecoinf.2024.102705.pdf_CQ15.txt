In the given context, several optimization techniques are mentioned that are used in the deep learning pipeline. These include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Gradient (AdaGrad), Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp), and Adam. Specifically, the text mentions that the AIP-OD model was trained using the Adam optimizer. This indicates that the Adam optimization technique was utilized in this particular case. However, other optimization methods such as SGD, AdaGrad, and RMSProp could also be applicable depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the problem being addressed.
