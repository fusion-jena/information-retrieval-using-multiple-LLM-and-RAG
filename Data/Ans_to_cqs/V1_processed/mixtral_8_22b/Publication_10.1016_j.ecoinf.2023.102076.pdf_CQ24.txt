Based on the given context, it appears that the focus is primarily on addressing issues related to imbalance in training data rather than handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, one strategy mentioned that could potentially address randomness is the use of a balanced stratified sample. In this case, data were grouped according to their initial exploitation-related query term and then 110 texts were randomly selected from each group. This ensured that each query group was equally represented in the data, effectively under-sampling certain texts and allowing the classifier to be trained with the full breadth of topics within the dataset. While this does not directly address randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does introduce a form of control by ensuring that the training data is representative and balanced. Other common strategies to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines include fixing the random seed value, using ensemble methods, and employing techniques like cross-validation. However, these strategies are not explicitly discussed in the provided context.
