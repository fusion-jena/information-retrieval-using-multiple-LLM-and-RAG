The deep learning model used in this research is built using Python and the fastai library. Fastai is a deep learning library which provides high-level components that can quickly and easily provide state-of-the-art results in standard deep learning domains, and provides researchers with low-level components that can be mixed and matched to build new approaches. It is built upon PyTorch, another popular deep learning framework.
