The paper by Liu and Abd-Elrahman (2018) does not explicitly mention any specific optimization technique used in their deep learning pipeline. However, they do state that they use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for image classification tasks. CNNs typically involve backpropagation and gradient descent algorithms for optimizing the model parameters during training.

In the work by Marasigan et al. (2019), no explicit information is given about the optimization techniques employed in their machine learning approach. They focus on developing a methodology for measuring mangrove crown diameters using airborne LiDAR data and the marker-controlled watershed algorithm.

On the other hand, Martins et al. (2021) provide more details regarding the optimization techniques used in their deep learning pipeline. They employ the Bird's Eye View (BEV) Faster Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) algorithm for segmentation tasks. During the training process, they utilize Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with momentum for optimizing the model parameters. Specifically, they set the learning rate to 0.003, the momentum to 0.9, and a batch size of 1. Additionally, they initialize the network with pretrained weights developed from the Microsoft Common Objects in Context (MS COCO) dataset.

Therefore, based on the available context, it can be concluded that one of the papers employs Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with momentum as an optimization technique in its deep learning pipeline.
