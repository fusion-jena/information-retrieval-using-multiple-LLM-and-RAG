The text does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, it can be inferred from the context that the models were evaluated using their validation accuracy, which measures how well a trained model performs on unseen data. In this case, the overall validation accuracies for both models were reported as 75.68% and 76.17%, respectively. Additionally, the accuracy of each model in predicting "present" and "absent" sample points was also considered. Based on these metrics, it could be concluded that the models were effective. Therefore, one possible criterion for determining when training is complete might be achieving a satisfactory level of validation accuracy or reaching a point where further improvements in validation accuracy become negligible.
