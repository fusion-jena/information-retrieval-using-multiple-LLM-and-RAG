The provided context does not directly discuss strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it mentions the use of a 10-fold cross-validation technique when defining the score-to-posterior-probability transformation function. This approach can help mitigate some effects of randomness by ensuring that the model is tested on different subsets of the data, providing a more robust evaluation of its performance. Additionally, the use of a hold-out validation set (50% of the training data) further contributes to reducing the impact of randomness by allowing for better tuning of hyperparameters and preventing overfitting. Nonetheless, specific strategies related to handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, like setting fixed seeds or employing deterministic algorithms, are not discussed in this context.
