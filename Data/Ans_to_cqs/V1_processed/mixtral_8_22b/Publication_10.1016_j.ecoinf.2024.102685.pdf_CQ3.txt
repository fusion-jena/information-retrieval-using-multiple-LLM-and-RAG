The given context does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The text discusses the use of Random Forest, a machine learning method, for classifying seagrass meadows using multispectral images. It also mentions the successful mapping of seagrass species distribution using high spatial resolution data from various satellites like Planet's RapidEye, PlanetScope, Maxar's WorldView-2, IKONOS, and Quickbird-2. However, it does not delve into the details of the data annotation methods employed in these processes. Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot determine which data annotation techniques were used in the deep learning pipeline.
