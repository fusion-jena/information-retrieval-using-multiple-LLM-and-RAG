The information provided does not explicitly state what data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer from the context that one of the data formats used is audio. This is because the research paper mentioned in the context discusses the development and testing of a bat call detection and classification method using convolutional neural networks. Bat calls are typically recorded as audio files, which suggests that the input data format for this particular deep learning model is likely to be audio. Additionally, the mention of echolocation signals further supports the idea that audio data is being used. It is also possible that other data formats such as images or videos could be used in different parts of the pipeline, but without more specific information about the pipeline, it cannot be confirmed.
