The text does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it mentions that the CNN model with the autoencoder showed better estimation performance for TDI, BMI, and FAI than the CNN model estimation without the autoencoder using a 10-fold cross-validation. This suggests that the data might have been divided into ten folds, where nine folds were used for training and one fold for validation during each iteration. After completing all iterations, the average performance across all validations could be reported. Additionally, the use of the term 'conventional machine learning models' indicates that there may also be separate testing datasets used to evaluate these models' generalization capabilities.
