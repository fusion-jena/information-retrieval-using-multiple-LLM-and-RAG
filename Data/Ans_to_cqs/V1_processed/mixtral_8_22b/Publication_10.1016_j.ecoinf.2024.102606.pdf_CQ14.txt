Based on the provided information, there isn't any explicit mention of how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, whether through methods such as grid search or random search. However, certain aspects of the model's configuration can still be discussed.

The model was trained with specific parameters including 500 epochs, an initial learning rate of 0.01, a weight decay of 0.005, and the use of the Adam optimizer with a beta1 value of 0.937. These values appear to be fixed rather than being determined through a systematic optimization process.

Data augmentation transformations were applied during training to help prevent overfitting and improve the model's performance on unseen data. Cross-validation was employed to further mitigate the risks associated with having a small dataset.

In summary, based on the available information, it appears that the hyperparameters of the model were manually selected rather than being systematically optimized via methods such as grid search or random search.
