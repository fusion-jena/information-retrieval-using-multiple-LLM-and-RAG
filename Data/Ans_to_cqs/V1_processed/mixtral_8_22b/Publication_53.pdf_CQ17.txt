The text does not provide explicit information about specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization being used in their deep learning pipeline. However, there is evidence of techniques employed to mitigate overfitting. For instance, they utilized transfer learning by initializing an ImageNet pre-trained ResNet34 model, which can be considered a form of regularization since it leverages previously learned features. Additionally, they implemented data augmentation using the fastai get_transforms function with various arguments like flip_vert, max_lighting, max_zoom, and to_fp16. This technique helps improve the model's ability to generalize better and reduces overfitting by artificially increasing the amount of training data through transformations. Lastly, they mention fine-tuning the model by unfreezing the entire model and training at a 10-fold lower learning rate, which could potentially serve as another method to reduce overfitting.
