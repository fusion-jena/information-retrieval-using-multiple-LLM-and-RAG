The text does not provide explicit information on the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, given that the task involves binary classification with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), common strategies such as cross-validation or validation split might have been employed. These methods involve setting aside a portion of the labeled data to evaluate the model's performance after each epoch or iteration during training. Additionally, metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score may have been utilized to assess the model's effectiveness in detecting search-phase bat calls.
