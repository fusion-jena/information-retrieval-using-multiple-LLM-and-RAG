Based on the given context, there is no direct mention of any optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it does state that they used a wrapper feature selection algorithm working with random forest analysis. This suggests that some form of optimization may be involved in their process, although it doesn't explicitly name which technique(s) were employed. Therefore, without further context, it cannot be definitively stated what optimization techniques were applied in their deep learning pipeline.
