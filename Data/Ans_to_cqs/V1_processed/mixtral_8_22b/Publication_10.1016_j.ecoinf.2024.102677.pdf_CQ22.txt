The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics such as overall accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics help measure how well the model performs in predicting the correct classes. Table 6 provides the values of these metrics for each of the five networks considered in the study. For instance, VGG16 has an accuracy of 0.7689, precision of 0.7734, recall of 0.7636, and F1-score of 0.7679. Similarly, Inceptionv3, ResNet34, ResNet50, and ResNet101 have different values for these metrics. Among them, ResNet50 achieves the highest performance with an accuracy of 0.8146, precision of 0.8197, recall of 0.8067, and F1-score of 0.8122.
