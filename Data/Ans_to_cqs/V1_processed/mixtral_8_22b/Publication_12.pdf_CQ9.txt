The article does not provide specific information about the availability or location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. It mentions the use of a self-developed open source software called Waveman, which includes three Python scripts: Converting\_image.py, Making\_database.py, and Training.py. However, there is no mention of any publicly accessible repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. To find the exact location of the data repository, one would need to contact the authors directly or search for additional resources related to their work.
