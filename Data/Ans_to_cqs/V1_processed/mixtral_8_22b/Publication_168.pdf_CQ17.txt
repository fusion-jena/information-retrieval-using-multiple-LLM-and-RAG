The text does not provide specific information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that Y. Chen et al. [6] designed a new CNN model with regularization based on the 3-D convolutional to solve the HSI classification task. Regularization techniques commonly used in deep learning include dropout, L1 regularization, and L2 regularization. Dropout randomly drops out neurons during training to prevent overfitting, while L1 and L2 regularizations add penalties to the loss function to discourage large weights. Without further details, we cannot determine which specific regularization method was employed in the mentioned study.
