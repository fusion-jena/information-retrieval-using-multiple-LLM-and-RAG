The data repository of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, there are references to sharing data via the GBIF portal (www.gbif.org) and using the 'PlantNet' R-package to query the Pl@ntNet API. Additionally, there is mention of accessing automatically identified occurrences via GBIF.org. Therefore, it can be inferred that the data might be accessible through the GBIF portal or the Pl@ntNet API. However, without explicit confirmation, it cannot be definitively stated where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
