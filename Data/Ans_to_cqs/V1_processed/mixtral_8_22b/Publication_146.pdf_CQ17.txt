The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the context that the authors have employed certain strategies to improve their model's accuracy and avoid overfitting.

One such strategy mentioned in the context is the use of the Adam optimizer instead of the static stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The Adam optimizer is known to help in preventing overfitting due to its ability to adjust the learning rate dynamically during the training process. This dynamic adjustment allows the model to converge more quickly and accurately while reducing the risk of getting stuck in local optima or overshooting the global minimum.

Additionally, the context mentions that the hyperparameters were set based on successful implementations of YOLO in remote sensing cases. While the exact values of these hyperparameters are not specified, they could potentially include regularization techniques like weight decay, which is equivalent to L2 regularization. Weight decay helps in controlling the complexity of the model by adding a penalty term to the loss function, thereby discouraging large weights and promoting sparsity.

In summary, although the provided context does not directly discuss regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization, it implies the use of strategies such as employing the Adam optimizer and possibly incorporating weight decay as part of the hyperparameter settings to prevent overfitting and enhance the overall performance of the deep learning pipeline.
