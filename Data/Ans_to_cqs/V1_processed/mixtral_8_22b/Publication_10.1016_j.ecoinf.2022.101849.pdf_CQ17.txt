The text does not provide information on the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. Instead, it discusses various ways of introducing artificial incompleteness into the dataset, including random reduction, non-random (biased) reduction, and comparing the mean absolute error after using baseline approaches and a partial imputation algorithm. It also mentions the use of clusters in the partial imputation algorithm. Additionally, the text provides examples of terminology used in the literature to describe weakly supervised learning tasks, which often involve different types of noise coming from the labeling process and data sources.
