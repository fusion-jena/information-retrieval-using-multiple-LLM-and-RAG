Based on the given context, there isn't enough information to provide a detailed step-by-step process about how the trained deep learning model was deployed. However, it does mention that the machine learning pipeline was written in Python using libraries such as Theano, Lasagne, and Librosa. It also mentions that the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) used for classification had its parameters learned from training data. Unfortunately, details regarding model serialization or platform selection aren't explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
