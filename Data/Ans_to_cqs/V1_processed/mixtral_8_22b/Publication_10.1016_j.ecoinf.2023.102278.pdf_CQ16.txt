The criterion used to determine when training is complete is the minimum total loss after nine epochs. This is observed through Fig. C.5, where overfitting begins after nine epochs, indicated by an increasing difference between training and validation loss. Despite this, the bias remains very low. It should be noted that the largest variation is only 0.6%, which is comparable to the variation of 0.8% when training with different values of alpha in Fig. B.4. This indicates a minimal impact on the change of accuracy for different choices of alpha.
