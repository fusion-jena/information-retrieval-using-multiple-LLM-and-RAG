The paper does not provide specific information about the availability or location of the deep learning pipeline's data repository. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the data repository is available on platforms such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. To find out more about the data repository, one would need to contact the authors directly or refer to any supplementary materials associated with the study.
