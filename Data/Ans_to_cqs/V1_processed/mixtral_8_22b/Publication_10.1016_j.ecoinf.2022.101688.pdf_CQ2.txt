In this case, the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is audio. The software code was specifically written for audio pre-processing, indicating that the main focus of the project involves working with audio data. Furthermore, several steps in the pre-processing stage involve manipulating audio files, including applying a low pass filter, downsampling, and extracting audio segments. Additionally, spectrograms were generated using the Librosa library, further emphasizing the use of audio data in the project. Therefore, it can be concluded that the primary data format utilized in the deep learning pipeline is audio.
