The text does not provide explicit information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the study focuses on detecting invasive Spartina alterniflora using Landsat satellite images. Additionally, there are references to previous research comparing Stacked AutoEncoders (SAEs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for African land-cover mapping using unspecified datasets. In summary, while no specific dataset names like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet are mentioned, the study uses Landsat satellite images for their deep learning application.
