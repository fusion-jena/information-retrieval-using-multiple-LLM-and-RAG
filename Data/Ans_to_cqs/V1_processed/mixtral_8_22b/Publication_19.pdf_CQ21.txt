After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be taken to evaluate the performance of the model and gain insights into its predictions. Some common postprocessing steps include:

1. Calculating metrics: Various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., can be calculated to assess the overall performance of the model. For example, in the given context, the macro average F1 scores and accuracies of different models have been reported.

2. Creating confusion matrices: Confusion matrices provide a visual representation of the performance of the model by comparing actual vs predicted labels. They help identify which classes are being confused with others and where the model might need improvement. In the given context, a confusion matrix has been created for the TFLite Inception-V3 model.

3. Generating saliency maps: Saliency maps highlight the regions of input images that contribute most towards the final prediction made by the model. This helps understand what features the model is focusing on while making decisions. However, no information about generating saliency maps is available in the given context.

4. Converting models to other formats: Depending upon the deployment requirements, models may need to be converted to specific formats like TensorFlow Lite, ONNX, etc. In the given context, the best trained Inception-V3 model has been converted to TensorFlow Lite format.

These postprocessing steps aid in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the model, thereby helping improve it further if needed.
