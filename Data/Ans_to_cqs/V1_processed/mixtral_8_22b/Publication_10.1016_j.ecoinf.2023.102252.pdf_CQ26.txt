The text does not provide explicit information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, common techniques include stratified splitting, which ensures equal representation of classes; oversampling, where minority class examples are duplicated or synthesized; undersampling, where majority class examples are removed; and diverse data collection, which aims to gather more representative samples from different sources. These methods help mitigate issues related to imbalanced datasets and improve overall performance of machine learning models.
