In this research, the datasets were randomly divided into three parts for training, validation, and testing. Specifically, 60% of the data was used to train the deep learning models, while 20% of it was reserved for validating the models. The remaining 20% of the data was utilized to assess the performance of the models. This distribution is summarized in Table 1, which shows the number of data points in the dataset and their allocation for training, testing, and validation purposes.
