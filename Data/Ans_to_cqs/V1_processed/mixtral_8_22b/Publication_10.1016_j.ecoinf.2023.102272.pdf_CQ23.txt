To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken during the model selection procedure. Firstly, five different models were generated for each of the four available deep-ANN architecture types, resulting in a diverse set of 20 models. These models were then trained with a small subset of the training data for four epochs. The accuracy of these candidate models was evaluated using a left-out validation data set, and the model with the highest performance was selected for further training on the full training data for up to 30 epochs. This process allowed for the identification of the most robust and accurate model from a diverse pool of candidates. Additionally, the data used for model training and selection were randomly partitioned into distinct subsets for training candidate models, validating candidate models, training the selected candidate model, and determining the optimal number of epochs to train the selected candidate model. This stratified splitting of the data helped prevent overfitting and ensured that the final model could generalize well to unseen data.
