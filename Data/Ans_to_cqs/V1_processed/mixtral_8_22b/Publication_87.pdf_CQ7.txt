The code snippets provided do not explicitly state the criteria used to split the data into training and validation sets. However, based on the given information, we can infer that the data was divided randomly into two parts - one for training and another for validation. This is evident from the line where the `pix_valid` dataset is created using the `labels` dataset, grouped by keywords, and filtered to include rows between 80% and 100%. This suggests that approximately 80% of the data was allocated for training purposes, while the remaining 20% was reserved for validation. The exact method of randomization or stratification is not specified in the provided context.
