The information provided does not explicitly state the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the primary data format used is images since the paper discusses the use of images for training and evaluating the ResNet50 model. Additionally, the datasets mentioned - Google Search Image, Portuguese Flora, and iNaturalist - are all related to plants and nature, suggesting that they primarily consist of images. Therefore, it can be concluded that the main data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images.
