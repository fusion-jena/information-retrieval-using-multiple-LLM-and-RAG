Based on the given context, it appears that the primary method for collecting raw data in this deep learning pipeline involves the use of sensors for water quality monitoring. Specifically, the research employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze spectral bands obtained from water quality monitoring sensors. These sensors likely collect data on various parameters related to water quality, such as temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, and nutrient levels. However, the exact types of sensors used and their specific applications are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Additionally, while the context does not discuss other potential sources of raw data like surveys or public datasets, they could also be relevant depending on the specific goals and requirements of the project. Therefore, it can be concluded that the main method for gathering raw data in this case is through water quality monitoring sensors, but other sources may also be considered based on individual needs and circumstances.
