The text snippets do not provide explicit details about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some general strategies can be employed to mitigate data bias issues. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes or labels within each set. This ensures that both sets contain representative samples from all categories, reducing potential biases caused by imbalanced class distributions.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to handle class imbalance problems. Oversampling increases the frequency of minority class examples by duplicating them or creating synthetic instances. Undersampling reduces the majority class examples either randomly or through more sophisticated methods like NearMiss or Condensed Nearest Neighbor (CNN). Both approaches aim to achieve balanced datasets, improving the performance of deep learning algorithms on underrepresented classes.

Diverse data collection focuses on gathering a wide range of data sources and types to ensure that the resulting dataset accurately reflects real-world scenarios. By incorporating various perspectives and avoiding overreliance on any single source, this strategy helps prevent biased representations and promotes fairness in deep learning applications.
