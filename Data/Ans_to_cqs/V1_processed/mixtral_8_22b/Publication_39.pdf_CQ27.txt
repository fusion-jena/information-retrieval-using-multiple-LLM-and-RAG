Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available in the given context to provide a detailed explanation about how the trained deep learning model was deployed. However, I can tell you that typically after training a deep learning model, the next step would be to save or serialize the model so that it can be loaded later without having to retrain it from scratch. This usually involves saving the weights and architecture of the network. Once the model has been saved, it can then be deployed onto various platforms such as web servers, mobile devices, or edge computing devices depending on the specific application requirements. Without further details about the deployment process, this is the general approach that could have been taken.
