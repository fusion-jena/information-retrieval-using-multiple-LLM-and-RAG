Based on the given context, it appears that the authors have employed max pooling as a method to prevent overfitting in their deep learning pipeline. This technique reduces the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, thereby reducing the number of parameters and computations required in the network. However, there is no explicit mention of other regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization being used in the described deep learning pipeline. Therefore, while max pooling has been utilized to mitigate overfitting, it remains unclear whether additional regularization methods were implemented.
