The text does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions that the model undergoes training using the balanced three-fold training dataset for a specified number of epochs. An epoch refers to one forward and one backward pass of all the training examples. Typically, training continues until a certain stopping criterion is met, such as reaching a maximum number of epochs or achieving a desired level of performance on a validation set. In this case, since the text mentions a specified number of epochs, it can be inferred that the training may have been stopped after completing these epochs. However, without further details, it cannot be confirmed if other stopping criteria were also considered.
