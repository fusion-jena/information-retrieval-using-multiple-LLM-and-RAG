Based on the given information, the specific method for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred from the context that the data used in the study might have been collected through monitoring systems like the CHE, SAICA, and SAIH. These systems could potentially use various methods such as sensors, surveys, or publicly available datasets to gather the necessary data. Nevertheless, without explicit details regarding the data collection methods, it cannot be definitively stated how the raw data was obtained.
