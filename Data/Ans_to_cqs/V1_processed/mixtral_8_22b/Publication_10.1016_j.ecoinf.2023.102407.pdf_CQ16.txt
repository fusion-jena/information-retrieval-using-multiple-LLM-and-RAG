The authors use the Area Under Curve (AUC) metric to evaluate the performance of their Species Distribution Model (SDM), specifically the SDP-EPL model. They incrementally generate pseudo-absence data using a teacher model consisting of ANN, RF, GBM, XGB, and LGBM models. The value of K, which determines the amount of pseudo-absence data generated, is chosen empirically based on the AUC of SDP-EPL on the validation set. In this case, they found that when K=200, the AUC improved as the number of training epochs increased, reaching its highest score overall. Therefore, it can be inferred that the authors consider training complete when the AUC reaches its peak or starts to decrease after increasing for some time. However, the exact threshold for determining when training should stop is not explicitly stated in the given context.
