Based on the given information, it appears that the authors did not explicitly mention the use of any specific deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers in their pipeline. They primarily focused on developing a supervised learning workflow using Google Earth Engine (GEE) and applying Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) methodology to classify woody cover from black and white aerial images.

However, they do suggest that going forward, analyzing aerial images of Kruger National Park (KNP) using deep learning methods, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), would be most effective and useful for mapping land cover or more specifically woody cover. This implies that while no specific deep learning model was mentioned in their current pipeline, they recommend considering CNNs for future research.
