The paper does not explicitly mention any specific dataset such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in the deep learning pipeline. Instead, it describes the use of a custom dataset called Pest24, which contains a large number of labeled images of various agricultural pests. Additionally, the authors discuss how they plan to incorporate user-labeled images into their system to improve its performance over time. They also acknowledge the existence of other datasets like those mentioned in Ciampi et al. (2023) and Wang et al. (2020), but do not provide further details about them. Therefore, based on the given context, it appears that the primary dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is Pest24.
