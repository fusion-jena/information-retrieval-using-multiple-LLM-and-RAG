The text does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions that the model with the lowest cross-entropy loss across a range of models with different numbers of hidden layers and subsets of features was selected to predict the conservation status of orchid species. This suggests that the training process might have been stopped once the validation loss reached its minimum value, which is a common practice in machine learning. Additionally, the use of cross-validation by shifting the validation set five times indicates that the performance of the model was evaluated multiple times during training to ensure stability and prevent overfitting.
