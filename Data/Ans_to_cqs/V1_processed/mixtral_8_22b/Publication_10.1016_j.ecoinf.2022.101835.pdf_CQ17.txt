The deep learning pipeline uses various regularization methods to prevent overfitting. Two common regularization techniques mentioned in the provided context are L1 regularization and L2 regularization. These methods work by adding a penalty term to the loss function during training, which discourages complex models and encourages simpler ones. This helps reduce overfitting and improves generalization. Additionally, other regularization techniques like dropout can also be employed but are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
