The text provides information about the use of transfer learning, where a pre-trained ResNet50 model was utilized. This model was initially trained on the ImageNet dataset containing over one million photo images from 1000 classes. Despite ImageNet not containing spectrograms, previous research has shown success in applying these pre-trained models to spectrogram classification tasks. However, there is no explicit mention of specific techniques such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting being employed to enhance the generalizability of the deep learning model. Therefore, based on the given context, it cannot be confirmed whether any of these methods were implemented to improve the model's ability to generalize.
