Unfortunately, based on the given context, it does not provide any direct reference or link to a specific code repository containing the deep learning pipeline used for identifying bird and frog species in tropical soundscape recordings. Therefore, I cannot provide the exact code repository link requested in the query. However, the paper mentioned in the context titled "A pipeline for identification of bird and frog species in tropical soundscape recordings using a convolutional neural network" was published in Ecological Informatics in 2020. You may want to look into this publication further or contact the authors directly to obtain more details about their work and potentially access the relevant code repository.
