To address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes or labels in both sets. This ensures that the model learns from a representative sample of the entire dataset, reducing potential biases caused by class imbalance.

Oversampling is a technique used when dealing with imbalanced datasets where one class has significantly fewer samples compared to others. It involves duplicating examples from the minority class until it reaches a similar number as the majority class. Alternatively, synthetic samples can be generated for the minority class using methods like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).

Undersampling, conversely, reduces the size of the majority class by randomly removing some of its instances. However, this method may lead to loss of valuable information if not applied carefully.

Lastly, collecting diverse data helps mitigate any inherent biases present within the original dataset. By gathering more varied examples, the model becomes better equipped to generalize across different scenarios and populations.

These techniques aim to create a balanced and unbiased representation of the problem domain, ultimately improving the overall performance and fairness of the deep learning models.
