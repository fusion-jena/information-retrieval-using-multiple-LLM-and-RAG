Unfortunately, there isn't any information available regarding the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline within the given context. However, I can provide some general insights into common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. These include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, translation, and adding noise.

Flipping involves horizontally or vertically reversing the image along its axis. Rotation entails rotating the image by a certain degree around its center point. Scaling adjusts the size of the image, either increasing or decreasing it. Cropping removes parts of the image to focus on a particular region. Translation shifts the position of the image within the frame. Lastly, adding noise introduces random pixel variations to increase robustness against noisy input.

These techniques help enhance the diversity of training datasets, reduce overfitting, and improve the overall performance of machine learning models. Nonetheless, the choice of technique depends on the nature of the dataset and the problem being addressed.
