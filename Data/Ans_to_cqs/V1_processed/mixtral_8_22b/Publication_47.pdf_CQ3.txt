The paper does not provide explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in their deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that they utilized various types of feature extraction methods based on digitally available occurrence records. These features include geographical (mean latitude and longitude, longitudinal and latitudinal range, extent of occurrence [EOO], area of occupancy [AOO], number of locations [sensu IUCN], and occurrence records), climatic (mean of 19 bioclim variables [Karger et al. 2017]), biome (presence in 14 biomes [Olson et al. 2001]), and anthropogenic (mean Human Footprint Index [Wildlife Conservation Society & International Earth Science Information Network 2005]) features. It appears that these features were extracted from existing datasets rather than being manually annotated using techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.
