The hyperparameters of the model are optimized by conducting logistic regression analysis on 288 grids, which helps derive the parameters x, u, and y. Furthermore, these parameters are refined through several hundred independent simulations, varying the parameter values to optimize the model. In the case of the leopard cat regression analysis model, a pseudo-R2 value greater than 0.80 was achieved, with determined parameter values being x = 0.92, y = 206.1, and u = 0.55. However, the specific optimization method such as grid search or random search is not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
