The text does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, or validation sets. However, it mentions that the SDP-EPL model is trained for up to 400 epochs, incrementally generating pseudo-labeled (PL) presence data and PL absence data using the teacher model with K = 200 every 100 epochs. This suggests that the dataset might be divided into batches or subsets for each epoch during the training process. Additionally, the mention of a validation set implies that some portion of the data is reserved for evaluating the performance of the model during training. Nevertheless, without further details, it is impossible to determine the exact criteria used for splitting the data.
