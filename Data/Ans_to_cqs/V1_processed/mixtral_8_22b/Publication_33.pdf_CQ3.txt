The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on common practices in deep learning pipelines, some possible data annotation techniques could include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, or instance segmentation. These techniques are often used when working with image data, such as those mentioned in the context like underwater images or plant species images. Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangles around objects of interest within an image, while semantic segmentation involves labeling every pixel in an image with its corresponding object category. Instance segmentation combines both bounding boxes and semantic segmentation to identify individual instances of objects within an image. Without more specific details from the context, it cannot be determined which technique was used in this particular case.
