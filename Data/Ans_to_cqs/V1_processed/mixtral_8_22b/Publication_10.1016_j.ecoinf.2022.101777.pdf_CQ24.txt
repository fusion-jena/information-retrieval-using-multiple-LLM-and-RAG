The text does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or setting a specific random seed value. However, it does mention the use of Random Forest (RF), which is a machine learning algorithm known for its ability to handle randomness effectively.

Random Forest works by creating multiple decision trees from different subsets of the data, each with varying degrees of randomness introduced during their creation. This randomness can be controlled through various hyperparameters such as the number of trees, the maximum depth of each tree, and the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node. By averaging the predictions of these diverse trees, Random Forest reduces overfitting and improves overall performance.

While the text does not explicitly discuss managing randomness through a fixed random seed value, this practice is common in many machine learning applications. Setting a fixed random seed allows for reproducibility of results across experiments and ensures consistency when comparing models trained under identical conditions. In the case of Random Forest, fixing the random seed would ensure that the same subset of features and samples are selected for each tree, leading to consistent results between runs.
