Based on the given information, it appears that the authors did not explicitly mention any specific data annotation techniques used in their deep learning pipeline. However, considering the nature of the problem being addressed - detecting deforestation in satellite imagery - it can be inferred that some form of semantic segmentation might have been employed. Semantic segmentation involves assigning a label or category to every pixel in an image, making it suitable for identifying areas affected by deforestation.

In this case, the dataset consists of tiles labeled as either 'available def.' (presumably indicating deforestation) or 'available no-def.' (indicating no deforestation). It seems likely that the authors would have used these labels to create pixel-wise masks for supervised learning purposes. Unfortunately, without explicit confirmation from the paper, one cannot definitively state what type of data annotation technique was utilized.
