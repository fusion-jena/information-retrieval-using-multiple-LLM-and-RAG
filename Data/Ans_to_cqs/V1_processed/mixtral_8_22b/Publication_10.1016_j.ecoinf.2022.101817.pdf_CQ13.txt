The text does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. It mainly focuses on describing the structure of the model, which is based on the VGG architecture but contains only 12 layers instead of the typical 16 or 19 layers found in conventional VGG models. Additionally, the text discusses the performance of the model in terms of frames processed per second and power consumption, as well as presenting the results of the cross-validation phase in the form of confusion matrices. However, without explicit mention of the hyperparameters used for training the model, we cannot determine their values from this context alone.
