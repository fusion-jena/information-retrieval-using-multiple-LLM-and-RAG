The text does not provide explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, based on general machine learning practices, some common postprocessing steps include metrics calculation, confusion matrix creation, saliency map generation, and model validation. In this case, the text mentions that the trained model was used to count wildebeest in 1,000 randomly selected survey images, excluding the 500 training images. This suggests that one of the postprocessing steps might involve applying the trained model to new data and evaluating its performance. Additionally, the text states that the counting data was downloaded and included the number of wildebeest counted by each user, their username, and the pixel location of each identification. This implies that another possible postprocessing step could involve analyzing the output data generated by the model.
