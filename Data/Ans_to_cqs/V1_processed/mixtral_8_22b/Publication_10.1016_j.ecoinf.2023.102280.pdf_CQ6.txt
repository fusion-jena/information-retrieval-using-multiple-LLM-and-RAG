Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved to prepare the data for optimal learning. While the specific steps can vary depending on the type of data and the problem being addressed, some common preprocessing steps include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing any irrelevant, incorrect, or redundant data points from the dataset. In the case of audio data, this could involve filtering out background noise or removing silence periods.

2. Normalization/Scaling: This step ensures that all features in the dataset have similar scales, preventing any single feature from dominating the learning process. For example, in audio data, amplitude values might need to be normalized to ensure they fall within a certain range.

3. Feature Extraction: This involves extracting relevant features from the raw data that will help the model learn effectively. In the case of audio data, this could involve converting the raw waveform into a spectrogram or mel-spectrogram, which provides a visual representation of the frequency content over time.

4. Augmentation: This involves creating new data by applying various transformations to existing data, such as adding noise, shifting pitch, or changing tempo. This helps increase the size of the dataset and improve the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.

5. Labeling: Depending on the task, labels may need to be assigned to each data point indicating the desired output of the model. For example, in a sound event detection task, each audio clip would need to be labeled with the corresponding sound events present in the clip.

In the given context, the authors mention collecting clean data and superimposing noise profiles to create both input data and a "denoised" ground truth. They also discuss using spectral subtraction to remove noise from the signal and randomly sampling noise from a dataset containing various types of noise features. These steps suggest that the authors are performing some form of data augmentation and labeling to prepare their data for training. However, without further details about the specific preprocessing steps taken, it is difficult to determine exactly what other steps were involved.
