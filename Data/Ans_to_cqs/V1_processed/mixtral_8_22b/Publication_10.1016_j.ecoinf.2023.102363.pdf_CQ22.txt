The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using three main metrics: Precision (P), Recall (R), and Accuracy (A). Precision measures the proportion of correctly identified positive instances among all instances predicted as positive. Recall calculates the proportion of correctly identified positive instances among all actual positive instances. Accuracy represents the ratio of correct predictions over the total number of instances. Additionally, the F1 score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is also used to assess the model's performance.
