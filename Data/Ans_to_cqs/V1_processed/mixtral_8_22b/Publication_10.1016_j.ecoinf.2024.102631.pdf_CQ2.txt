Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline uses images as the primary data format. Specifically, the network takes images with dimensions of 256 x 256 pixels and three color channels as input. The goal of the network is to enhance the quality of underwater images, demonstrating its effectiveness through various metrics such as UIQM, UCIQE, and NIQE scores. Therefore, the main data format used in this deep learning pipeline is images.
