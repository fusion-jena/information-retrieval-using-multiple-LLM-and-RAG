To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed. One common strategy is to use a fixed random seed value across all experiments. By setting a specific seed value, the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers will be generated, ensuring reproducibility of results. Another approach is to perform multiple runs with different initializations or seeds and average the results to reduce variability caused by randomness. Additionally, some frameworks provide options to control the level of randomness during training, such as deterministic mode or disabling certain sources of randomness like data augmentation or dropout layers. However, it should be noted that while reducing randomness can improve consistency, it may also limit the exploration of the search space and potentially lead to suboptimal solutions. Therefore, finding the right balance between controlling randomness and allowing sufficient exploration is crucial for achieving good performance in deep learning applications.
