Data augmentation techniques were indeed applied in the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, the text mentions that a 90Â° rotation and vertical and horizontal flips were used. These techniques help increase the diversity of the dataset and prevent overfitting by creating new instances from existing ones through various transformations. However, it does not explicitly mention scaling as a technique employed in this case.
