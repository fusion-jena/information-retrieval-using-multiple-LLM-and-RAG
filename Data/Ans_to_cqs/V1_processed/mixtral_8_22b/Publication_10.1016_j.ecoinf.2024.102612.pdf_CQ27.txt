The text does not provide explicit information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model, including details like model serialization or platform selection. However, based on common practices in deep learning projects, after training the model, it would typically be saved or serialized into a format that allows it to be loaded later for inference purposes. Common formats include.h5,.onnx, or.pb files. Once the model is saved, it could then be deployed onto various platforms depending on the project requirements. These platforms might include cloud services, edge devices, mobile applications, or web servers. Unfortunately, without specific information regarding the deployment process, I cannot provide further details beyond general practices.
