The paper does not provide information about the method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether surveys, sensors, public datasets, or other methods were employed for this purpose.

Based on the given context, the study focuses on developing machine learning models using Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and LightGBM algorithms to predict the timing of cherry blossoms in Kyoto, Japan. The authors use meteorological data from the Automated Meteorological Data Acquisition System (AMeDAS) operated by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). However, there is no mention of how this data was collected or what specific sensors or instruments were used. Additionally, the paper does not discuss any survey methods or public datasets used for gathering data.

Therefore, based on the available information, it can only be concluded that meteorological data from AMeDAS was used in the development of the machine learning models. Further details regarding the collection of raw data in the deep learning pipeline cannot be determined from the provided context.
