After the model training, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the project. In the given context, it appears that the authors have utilized a confusion matrix for evaluating the performance of their deep learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for farm dam detection. A confusion matrix is a table layout that allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm. Each row of the matrix represents the instances in an actual class while each column represents the instances in a predicted class. This helps in calculating various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

In addition to the confusion matrix, the authors also mention using a step-by-step graphical diagram for calculating absolute and relative rates in the construction of Australian farm dams. This suggests that they might have employed additional postprocessing techniques like data analysis and interpretation to derive meaningful insights from their results. However, without further information, it cannot be confirmed if other common postprocessing techniques like saliency maps or GradCAM were used.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include creating a confusion matrix for evaluation, utilizing a step-by-step graphical diagram for calculations, and possibly employing data analysis and interpretation techniques.
