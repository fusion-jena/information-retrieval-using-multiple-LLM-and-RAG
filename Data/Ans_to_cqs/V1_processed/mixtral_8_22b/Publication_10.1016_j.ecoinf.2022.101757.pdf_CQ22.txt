Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about specific evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall being used to assess the performance of a deep learning model. However, several metrics are mentioned throughout the text, including R^2, NSL, and sample variance. These metrics appear to be related to the computation of distance measures rather than traditional classification metrics like accuracy, precision, or recall. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, it cannot be determined what specific evaluation metrics are used to measure the performance of a deep learning model.
