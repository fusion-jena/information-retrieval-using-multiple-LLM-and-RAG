In the given context, there is mention of a specific regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline - Dropout. Dropout is a technique where during training, some number of neuron outputs are randomly ignored or "dropped out." This has the effect of making the layer look-like and be treated-like a layer with a different number of nodes and connectivity to the prior layer. In doing so, it reduces overfitting by providing a way of automatically and adaptively regularizing neural networks.

In the described model, a drop-out layer was assigned a drop-out rate of 0.5, meaning each node was ignored with a 50% probability. This means that half of the nodes in the first fully connected (FC) layer were dropped out in each training iteration, causing nodes in the previous FC layer to be probabilistically ignored. This emulated training a group of different models and reduced the chance of overfitting.
