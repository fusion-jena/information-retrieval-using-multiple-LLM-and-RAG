Based on the given context, it does not provide information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or setting a specific random seed value. However, some general strategies to manage randomness in machine learning pipelines include fixing the random seed value before training the model, using cross-validation techniques, and employing ensemble methods like random forests. In the case of random forests, multiple decision trees are created with different subsets of data and features, reducing overfitting and improving overall performance.
