The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that various types of data formats were utilized in different studies. For instance, one study mentioned using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to model species distributions, which typically use image data as input. Another study analyzed bird songs, suggesting the use of audio data. Additionally, there was a reference to dealing with multivariate data, which could imply the use of structured data like CSV files. Therefore, while the exact data formats used in each case are not specified, it appears that multiple formats including images, audio, and possibly structured data might have been employed depending on the specific requirements of each study.
