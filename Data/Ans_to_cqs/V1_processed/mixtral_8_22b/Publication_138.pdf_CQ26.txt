Based on the given context, there is no information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, some common techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline are:

* Stratified Splitting: In this technique, the dataset is divided into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes in both sets. This helps to ensure that the model does not become biased towards any particular class.
* Oversampling: In this technique, the minority class samples are duplicated to balance the dataset. This helps to prevent the model from becoming biased towards the majority class.
* Undersampling: In this technique, the majority class samples are removed to balance the dataset. This helps to prevent the model from becoming biased towards the majority class.
* Diverse Data Collection: Collecting diverse data from various sources can help to reduce data bias. For example, collecting images from different geographical locations, lighting conditions, angles, etc. can help to create a more robust model.

However, without further context, it cannot be determined if these techniques were specifically used in the described deep learning pipeline.
