The text does not provide explicit information about the splitting of data into training, testing, or validation sets specifically for deep learning models. However, it mentions that for model creation, 80% of the data was used as the training set, while the remaining 20% was used as the evaluation set to assess model performance. Although this division is not explicitly stated as being for deep learning models, it can be assumed that these percentages could also apply to such models. In machine learning and deep learning, it is common practice to divide datasets into training, testing, and sometimes validation sets. Typically, the majority of the dataset is allocated to the training set, which is used to fit the model parameters. A smaller portion of the dataset is then reserved for the testing set, which is employed to estimate how well the model will perform on unseen data. Occasionally, another subset known as the validation set may be utilized during the training process to fine-tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.
