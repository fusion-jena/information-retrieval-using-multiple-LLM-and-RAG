The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. However, based on common practices in machine learning, some possible postprocessing steps could include evaluating the performance of the models using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc. Additionally, visualizing the predictions made by the models using techniques like saliency maps or heatmaps might also be useful. Furthermore, creating a confusion matrix to understand the misclassifications made by the models would also be beneficial. But without explicit mention in the provided context, these cannot be confirmed as the actual postprocessing steps followed in this case.
