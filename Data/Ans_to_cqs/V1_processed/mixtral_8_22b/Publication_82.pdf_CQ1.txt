The authors of this study utilize the publicly available dataset called PlantVillage. This dataset contains over 54,000 images of healthy and diseased leaves collected under controlled conditions. The dataset includes images of various crops such as corn, grapes, potatoes, tomatoes, apples, strawberries, blueberries, peaches, oranges, lemons, cherries, squash, bell peppers, raspberries, and soybeans. Each image in the dataset is labeled with its corresponding disease class. The dataset is divided into three categories based on color: color, grayscale, and leaf segmentation. Additionally, the dataset provides information about the mapping of multiple images of the same leaf taken from different orientations. However, it should be noted that the authors only provide this information for 41,112 images out of the total 54,306 images. Overall, the authors rely solely on the PlantVillage dataset for their deep learning pipeline and do not mention any other methods for collecting raw data.
