The authors of the paper have not explicitly mentioned any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model. However, they did mention using a diverse dataset consisting of 30 different bird species, which could contribute to improving the model's generalization ability. Additionally, the high accuracy rates achieved in their experiments suggest that the model may have good generalization performance. Nevertheless, without explicit information about techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting, we cannot definitively state what measures were taken to ensure the model's generalizability.
