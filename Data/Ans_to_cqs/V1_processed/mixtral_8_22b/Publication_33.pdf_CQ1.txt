The authors of the paper built their own dataset instead of using existing ones like Fish4Knowledge. They collected raw data through underwater high-definition videos recorded in various depths, luminosities, and environments on fringing and barrier reefs around Mayotte Island in the Western Indian Ocean. The videos were captured using GoPro Hero 3+ Black and Hero 4+ Black cameras. From these videos, they extracted fish images to create three independent datasets for training and testing their Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and post-processing method.
