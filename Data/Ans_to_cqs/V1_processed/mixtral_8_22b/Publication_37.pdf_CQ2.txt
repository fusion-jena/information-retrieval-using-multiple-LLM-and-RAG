The deep learning pipeline described in the given context uses audio data format. This can be inferred from several parts of the context. Firstly, the paper mentioned in reference [17] discusses "Deep convolutional neural networks and data augmentation for environmental sound classification." Secondly, the context mentions applying various audio deformations such as adding background noise, dynamic range compression, pitch shifting, and time stretching. Lastly, it refers to the MUDA library, which is specifically designed for audio data augmentation. Therefore, based on these points, it can be concluded that the deep learning pipeline discussed here primarily deals with audio data.
