The paper proposes several machine learning models including XGBoost (XGB), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks. However, it does not explicitly state the specific task or purpose of these deep learning models. Based on the information given, we can infer that these models are likely being used for regression tasks due to their application in predictive modeling and the use of negative mean squared error as a target measure during hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, the mention of kernel functions in relation to SVR suggests that they may be handling non-linear data. Overall, without more explicit context regarding the intended purpose of each model, we cannot definitively determine whether they are being used for classification, segmentation, detection, or another type of task.
