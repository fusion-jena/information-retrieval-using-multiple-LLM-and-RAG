The table mentioned in the given context (Table 1) provides the details about how the data was split for training and testing of the proposed models. Unfortunately, the specific percentages or numbers used for this division are not explicitly stated in the provided text. However, it does mention that the data was divided into five equal folds in the proposed FAA-based approach. This implies that the dataset might have been divided into five parts, where four parts could have been used for training and one part for testing. Additionally, the text mentions that the optimal augment policies are evaluated and recognized after processing the folds. This indicates that there may also have been a separate validation set used for tuning hyperparameters and selecting the best performing model. In summary, while the exact proportions used for dividing the data are not specified, the context suggests that the data was likely divided into training, testing, and possibly validation sets.
