The paper does not explicitly mention any standard datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it mentions several types of datasets used in their experiments:

1. Static images and living videos of a commercial orchard
2. RGB-images and point cloud data of a commercial orchard
3. RGB-images of a single tree branch
4. RGB-images of urban streets
5. Synthetic images and natural images of forests
6. RGB-images of a modern apple orchard
7. RGB-images of complex urban scenes

These datasets seem to be specific to the research topic, focusing on applications related to agriculture and urban environments.
