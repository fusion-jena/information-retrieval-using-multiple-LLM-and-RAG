The text does not explicitly mention the specific evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does indicate that the team adjusted the number of training steps to optimize the trade-off between computing time and classification efficiency. They also mentioned considering factors like correct identification rate and processing time to determine the optimal number of training steps. While these factors do not directly correspond to standard evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, or recall, they still provide insights into the model's performance.

The correct identification rate can be interpreted as a measure of accuracy, indicating the proportion of correctly classified instances among all evaluated cases. Processing time, on the other hand, serves as a practical metric to gauge the computational cost associated with running the model. In summary, while the exact evaluation metrics remain unspecified, the information available suggests that the team focused on aspects related to accuracy and computational efficiency when evaluating the deep learning model.
