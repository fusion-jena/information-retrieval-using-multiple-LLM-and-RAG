The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the provided context is classification. Specifically, the model is designed to identify and classify different species based on pre-defined classes established by human experts. The model uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, which belongs to the class of deep learning algorithms (DLAs). During the training phase, the parameters of the classifier are automatically optimized to accurately classify a "training" database. The model is then fine-tuned using a second and independent database to adjust a risk threshold specific to each class (i.e., each species). The ultimate goal of this deep learning model is to aid in monitoring biodiversity through large datasets containing unidentified species, providing ecologists with a powerful tool for analyzing big data and conducting real-time biodiversity monitoring from remote sensors.
