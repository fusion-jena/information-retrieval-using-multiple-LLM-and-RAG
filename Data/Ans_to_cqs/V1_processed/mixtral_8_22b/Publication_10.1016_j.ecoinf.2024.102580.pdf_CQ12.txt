The paper uses a semantic segmentation model for vegetation mapping. However, the specific type of deep learning model used, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers, is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. Therefore, based on the information provided, I cannot determine the exact type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
