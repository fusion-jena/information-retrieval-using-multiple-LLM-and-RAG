The information provided does not explicitly mention which specific framework was used to build the deep learning model. However, it mentions using Maxent models, a machine learning technique often used in species distribution modeling. This method is not directly related to deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, based on the given context, we cannot determine which deep learning framework was used to build the model.
