The purpose of the deep learning model discussed here is primarily for classification tasks. Specifically, it aims to differentiate between healthy and unhealthy plant leaf images. The model, known as BEiT, uses the BERT architecture, initially designed for Natural Language Processing (NLP), but adapted for image processing. Its main function is to predict the original information after transforming images into distinct visual elements and masking a portion of these elements. This process helps the model learn from visual tokens derived from the image patches using a discrete Gaussian or speckle noise transformation. The ultimate goal is to achieve accurate classification results, as evidenced by the high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores reported in the text.
