Based on the provided context, it does not appear that any form of deep learning model, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers, is explicitly mentioned or used within the described pipeline. Instead, the text discusses various types of statistical and machine learning algorithms employed for modeling purposes. Specifically, these include regularized elastic net regressions, Bayesian regularized Spike-and-Slab regressions, Bayesian additive regression trees, monotonic gradient descent boosting, and extreme gradient boosting. However, none of these methods fall under the category of deep learning models. Therefore, based solely on the information presented, I cannot determine what type of deep learning model might be used in the pipeline, if any.
