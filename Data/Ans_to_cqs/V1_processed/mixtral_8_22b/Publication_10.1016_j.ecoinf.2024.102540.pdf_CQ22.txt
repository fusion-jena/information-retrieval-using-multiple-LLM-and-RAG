In this study, the authors use four evaluation metrics to assess the performance of their deep learning models. These include precision, mean average precision (mAP@0.5), recall, and mean percent error of misdetection. Precision is defined as the percentage of correct positive predictions made by the model. Mean average precision (mAP@0.5) measures the accuracy of object detection models using an Intersection-over-Union measure set to 0.5. Recall indicates how well the model can correctly identify objects from all possible detections it should make. Lastly, mean percent error of misdetection calculates the proportion of incorrect detections made by the model.
