The provided context does not directly address the strategy for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing the impact of random seed values. However, it discusses various aspects related to deep learning applications in mapping seagrass coverage and distribution.

Randomness in deep learning pipelines often arises due to factors like initializing weights randomly, shuffling training datasets, dropout regularization techniques, etc. To manage this randomness, several strategies can be employed:

1. Fixed Random Seeds: One common approach is setting fixed random seeds during development and testing phases. This ensures consistency across multiple runs, making results reproducible and comparable.

2. Multiple Runs with Different Seeds: Another method involves running experiments multiple times with different random seeds. Averaging the performance metrics from these runs provides a more robust evaluation of the model's effectiveness.

3. Cross-Validation: Using cross-validation techniques helps reduce variability caused by random splits of the dataset into training and validation sets. K-fold cross-validation is commonly used where the original sample is randomly partitioned into k equal sized subsamples.

4. Ensemble Methods: Combining predictions from multiple models trained with different random seeds can improve overall performance and stability. Techniques include bagging, boosting, stacking, etc.

While these strategies help manage randomness, they do not eliminate its presence entirely. It's important to acknowledge that some degree of randomness is inherent in many deep learning processes.
