The paper does not explicitly mention strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, specifically regarding the random seed value. However, it does provide information on how Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) deal with randomness. ELMs are a type of Single-Layer Feedforward Neural Network (SLFFNN) that employ random input weights and bias values in the hidden layer. This randomness allows ELMs to achieve high learning speeds compared to traditional backpropagation feedforward neural networks. Despite this inherent randomness, ELMs still maintain accurate learning capabilities.

In summary, while the paper does not directly address strategies for handling randomness in the form of a random seed value, it does demonstrate how ELMs leverage randomness in input weights and bias values to improve learning performance.
