The text does not provide specific details about the exact data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the fast auto-augmentation (FAA) method was used to improve the data. This method involves controllers sampling data augmentation policies from the searched space, and augmenters transforming the dataset images with the new policy. It also states that FAA minimizes the computational complexity of deep learning and improves performance in the image classification process. Therefore, while we cannot list the specific techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling, we can infer that various data augmentation techniques were employed through the use of the FAA method.
