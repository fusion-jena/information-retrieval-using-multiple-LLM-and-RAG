The study compiled a comprehensive dataset to explore the temporal dynamics of various factors' influence on drought propagation. This dataset included various influencing factors and an extensive drought propagation time series spanning from January 1950 to December 2020. Using a sliding window method with a window size of 30 years and a step size of one year, they generated forty-two distinct datasets, each corresponding to a separate SPEI time scale. However, the specific names or types of these datasets were not mentioned in the given context. Therefore, it cannot be determined if any well-known datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet were used in their deep learning pipeline.
