The text mentions that the authors use different architectures pre-trained with the ImageNet dataset. This means that they leverage existing models trained on the ImageNet dataset, which contains millions of labeled images belonging to thousands of categories. By using these pre-trained models, they can take advantage of the learned features and apply them to their own dataset, which is not explicitly mentioned but consists of leaf images from ten different species.
