Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide a detailed response about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, based on common practices in machine learning projects, once the model has been successfully trained and validated, it would typically be saved or serialized into a format that allows it to be used later for predictions. This might involve saving the model weights or creating a complete model file that includes both the architecture and the weights.

As for platform selection, this depends on various factors such as the intended application, resources availability, and performance requirements. Common platforms include cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure, or local servers depending on the specific needs of the project.

However, since these details aren't explicitly mentioned in the given context, I cannot provide a more precise answer regarding the exact process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
