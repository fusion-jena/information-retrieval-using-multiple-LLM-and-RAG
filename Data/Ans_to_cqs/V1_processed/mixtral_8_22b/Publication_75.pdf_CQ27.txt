Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available from the given context to provide a detailed explanation about how the trained deep learning model was deployed. The text only discusses the structure and performance of the proposed network called SeedNet but does not mention any specific details regarding its deployment. Therefore, it is impossible to determine what process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection.
