Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, particularly regarding random seed values. However, some implicit strategies can be inferred from the information provided.

Firstly, the use of pre-trained models like VGG16 and their adaptation for specific tasks suggests that the authors might have leveraged the stability and robustness of these pre-trained models to mitigate the effects of randomness. Pre-trained models often provide a more stable starting point compared to training a model from scratch, which could help reduce variability due to random initialization or other sources of randomness.

Secondly, the application of various data augmentation techniques such as height and width shifts, flips, zooms, and brightness changes indicates that the authors aimed to introduce controlled variations into the dataset. These techniques can help improve the generalizability of the models and potentially counteract the impact of randomness during training.

Lastly, the use of a relatively large batch size of 32 and a moderate number of epochs (20) for training the classification networks implies that the authors may have sought to strike a balance between computational efficiency and convergence. A larger batch size can lead to more stable updates during optimization, reducing the potential influence of random fluctuations. Similarly, limiting the number of epochs can prevent overfitting and excessive sensitivity to noise or randomness in the training data.

However, without further details about the handling of random seeds or other aspects related to managing randomness, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query.
