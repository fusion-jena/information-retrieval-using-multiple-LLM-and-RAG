The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include rotation, reflectance bias of ±10%, and random noise of ±10% reflectance for 15% of the input image. These techniques aim to increase sample variation and improve the model's ability to generalize. Rotation involves rotating images by various angles, while reflectance bias adjusts the brightness levels within the image. Random noise introduces small variations in pixel values, simulating real-world conditions such as sensor noise or atmospheric effects.
