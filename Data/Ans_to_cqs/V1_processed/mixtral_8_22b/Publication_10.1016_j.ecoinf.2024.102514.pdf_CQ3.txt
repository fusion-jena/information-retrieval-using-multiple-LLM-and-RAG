Based on the given context, it does not provide information about the specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context focuses more on the application of machine learning models for assessing water quality using different methods and steps including data collection, feature selection, model development, validation, and evaluation. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based on the given context regarding the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
