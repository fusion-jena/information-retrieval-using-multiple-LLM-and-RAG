According to the given information, it appears that the hyperparameters of the model were optimized using a hold-out validation strategy. Specifically, 50% of the training data was held out for validation purposes. However, the exact methodology used for hyperparameter tuning, such as grid search or random search, is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. Therefore, based on the available information, we cannot definitively state how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized beyond knowing that a hold-out validation strategy was employed.
