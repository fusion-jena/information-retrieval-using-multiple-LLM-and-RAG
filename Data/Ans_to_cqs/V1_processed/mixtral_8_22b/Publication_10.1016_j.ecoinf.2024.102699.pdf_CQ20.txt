The text mentions that the authors conducted local experiments using general-purpose graphics processing units (GPGPUs). Their test environment consists of current consumer-grade hardware, including an Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9900K CPU @ 3.60GHz with 7200 BogoMips, a TITAN RTX GPU, 128GB RAM, and a Samsung 970 EVO Plus SSD with 500GB storage capacity. Therefore, they use GPGPUs, specifically a TITAN RTX GPU, along with other hardware components like CPU, RAM, and SSD, for training their deep learning models.
