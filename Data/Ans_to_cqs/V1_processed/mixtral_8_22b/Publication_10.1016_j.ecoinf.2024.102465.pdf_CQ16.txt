The given context does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed for a machine learning model. However, common criteria include reaching a certain number of epochs, achieving a desired level of accuracy or performance, or observing a plateau in the validation loss. The choice of criterion depends on the specific problem and goals of the model. In some cases, early stopping may be employed to prevent overfitting if the validation loss begins to increase after initially decreasing.
