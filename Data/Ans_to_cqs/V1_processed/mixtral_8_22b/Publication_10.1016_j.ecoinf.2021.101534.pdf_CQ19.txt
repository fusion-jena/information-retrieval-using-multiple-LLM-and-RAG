Unfortunately, based on the given context, there isn't enough information to determine which specific frameworks were used to build the deep learning model. The context mentions the use of short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and converting mixed audio clips into spectrograms for input images, but does not provide details about the deep learning framework or library used for building the model. Some popular deep learning frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and Caffe, among others. However, without further context, we cannot definitively state which one was used in this particular scenario.
