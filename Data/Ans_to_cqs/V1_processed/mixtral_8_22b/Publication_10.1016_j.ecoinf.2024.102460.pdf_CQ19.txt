Unfortunately, the given context does not explicitly mention which specific frameworks or libraries are used to build the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model is employed for solving the prediction problem of time series data. Generally, popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch support building LSTM models. Therefore, either TensorFlow or PyTorch could have been used to construct the LSTM model mentioned in the context. Nonetheless, without explicit information about the frameworks utilized, we cannot definitively state whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other library was used to develop the deep learning model.
