Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available in the given context to provide a detailed explanation about how the trained deep learning model was deployed. However, typically after training a deep learning model, the next steps involve saving or serializing the model, selecting a platform where the model will be hosted, and then integrating the saved model into this platform. After deployment, the model can receive input data and generate predictions accordingly.
