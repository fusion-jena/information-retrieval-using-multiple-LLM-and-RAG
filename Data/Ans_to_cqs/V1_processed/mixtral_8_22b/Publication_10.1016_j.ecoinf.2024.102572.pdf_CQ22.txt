The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it is common practice in machine learning to use various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC, etc. depending on the nature of the problem being solved. In this case, since the context mentions using machine learning techniques to classify fire-damaged monuments, one could infer that classification metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score might have been used. But without explicit information, we cannot be certain which metric was used.
