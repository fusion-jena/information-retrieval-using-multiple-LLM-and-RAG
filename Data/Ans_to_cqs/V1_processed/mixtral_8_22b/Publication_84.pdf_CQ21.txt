Based on the given context, it is not explicitly stated what specific postprocessing steps were taken after the model training. However, we can infer some possible postprocessing steps based on common practices in deep learning and remote sensing applications.

After training a deep learning model like the Stacked Autoencoder (SAE) used in this study, one common postprocessing step is to evaluate the model's performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score. These metrics help quantify how well the model has learned to distinguish between different classes (in this case, paddy rice vs. other land cover types). The confusion matrix mentioned in the query is often used to calculate these metrics.

Additionally, visualizing the results through saliency maps or heatmaps can provide insights into which input features contribute most significantly to the model's predictions. This information can be useful for understanding the model's decision-making process and identifying any potential biases or limitations.

Furthermore, since this study focuses on applying deep learning techniques to remote sensing data, another important postprocessing step might involve analyzing the spatial distribution of predicted classes across the study area. This could include generating thematic maps or conducting spatial statistics to identify patterns or trends in the data.

Overall, while the exact postprocessing steps taken in this study are not specified, it is likely that they included evaluating the model's performance using various metrics, visualizing the results through saliency maps or heatmaps, and possibly analyzing the spatial distribution of predicted classes.
