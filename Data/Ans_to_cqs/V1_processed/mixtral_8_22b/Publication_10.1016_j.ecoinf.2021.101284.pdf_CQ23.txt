The materials and methods section does not provide explicit details on any specific deep learning model or its evaluation process. However, it mentions the use of standardization as a method for pre-processing the data. Standardization is a technique used to change the scale of individual variables so that they are presented in a similar numerical range while preserving their distance relationships. This helps in making different types of data comparable and improves the performance of machine learning algorithms.

Although there is no direct mention of using diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting techniques, these methods are commonly employed to improve the generalizability of deep learning models. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into multiple subsets and training the model on different combinations of those subsets to evaluate its performance. Stratified splitting ensures that the distribution of classes in the train and test sets remains consistent with the original dataset. These techniques help prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to perform well on unseen data.

Since the text does not explicitly discuss the application of such techniques, it cannot be confirmed whether they were utilized in this particular case. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
