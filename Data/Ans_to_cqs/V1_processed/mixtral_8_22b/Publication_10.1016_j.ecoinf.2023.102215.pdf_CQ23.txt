The text does not provide explicit details about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using diverse datasets or employing techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting. However, it mentions that recent deep SOD models have been successful in generating desirable saliency identification results on public datasets. This suggests that these models may have undergone some form of validation process involving diverse data sources. Additionally, the mention of incorporating a pyramid pooling module into the FPN architecture by PoolNet implies that the model was designed to handle varying input sizes and resolutions, further contributing to its potential generalizability. Nevertheless, without concrete evidence regarding the exact methods used to validate and improve the model's performance across different scenarios, one cannot definitively state what measures were specifically taken to ensure its generalizability.
