The study uses three types of datasets: color, grayscale, and leaf segmented. However, the specific names or sources of these datasets are not mentioned in the provided information. It only mentions the use of the PlantVillage dataset in one of the experiments, but no further details about this dataset are provided. Therefore, I cannot provide a comprehensive list of all the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
