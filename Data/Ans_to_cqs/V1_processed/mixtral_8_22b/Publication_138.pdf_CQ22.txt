The performance of a deep learning model can be evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics provide insights into different aspects of the model's performance.

Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of total predictions made by the model. It is calculated as shown in equation (1):

Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN) * 100%

where TP represents true positives, TN stands for true negatives, FP denotes false positives, and FN signifies false negatives.

Precision evaluates the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all instances predicted as positive. Equation (2) demonstrates how it is computed:

Precision = (TP) / (TP + FP) * 100%

Recall calculates the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all actual positive instances. Its formula is given in equation (3):

Recall = (TP) / (TP + FN) * 100%

Lastly, the F1 score combines both precision and recall to give a single metric representing the overall performance of the model. It is defined in equation (4):

F1 = (2 * Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall) * 100%

These metrics help assess the effectiveness of a deep learning model and identify areas where improvements may be needed.
