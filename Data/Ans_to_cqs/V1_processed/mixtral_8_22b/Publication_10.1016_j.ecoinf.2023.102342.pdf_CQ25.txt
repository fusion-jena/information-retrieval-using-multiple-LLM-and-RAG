Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of a deep learning model being used in this case study. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the purpose of any such model. However, the context does describe a knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) process, which involves identifying patterns or relationships within a dataset to make important decisions. This process includes steps such as identifying the aim for a specific study area, pre-selecting useful data to achieve the objective, performing analytical determinations, and optimizing and elaborating the obtained results. It is also mentioned that the numerical values of some parameters were calculated and provided as measures of the association values to explain the data mining results. These steps suggest that the overall goal of this process may be to extract insights from the data to inform decision making, rather than to use a deep learning model for a specific task such as classification, segmentation, or detection.
