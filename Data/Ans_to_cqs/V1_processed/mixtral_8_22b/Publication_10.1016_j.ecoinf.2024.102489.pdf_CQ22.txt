The given context does not provide information about the specific evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the study used a grid search method (GridSearchCV) based on the out-of-bag (OOB) error and five-fold cross-validation to find the optimal parameters of the model. These methods can be used to optimize hyperparameters and improve the overall performance of the model. Common evaluation metrics for deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC, etc. But without explicit mention in the provided context, we cannot confirm which ones were used in this particular case.
