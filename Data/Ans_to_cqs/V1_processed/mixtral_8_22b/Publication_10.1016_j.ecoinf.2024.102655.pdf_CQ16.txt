The table titled "Table 3 Criteria for the selection of data included in Best Training Subset - BTS" provides the criteria used to select the best subset of data for training machine learning models. These criteria include cluster, monitoring stations, tendency, variation from tendency, and autocorrelation. However, this does not directly address the query regarding determining when training is complete. Based on the given context, it appears that the authors did not explicitly state the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. Nevertheless, common practices in machine learning suggest that one possible criterion could be observing a plateau or convergence in the validation loss during the training process. This indicates that the model has learned sufficiently from the training data and further training might result in overfitting. Another commonly used criterion is setting a predefined maximum number of epochs or iterations for training. Once this limit is reached, the training process stops regardless of whether the validation loss has converged or not.
