To collect raw data for training a U-Net model to identify Hedychium Coronarium, an invasive vegetation species in Brazilian natural flora, a DJI Phantom 2 drone with Global Positioning System (GPS) is used. The drone captures RGB images from different heights and angles during its flight. These images serve as input for training the network. This method allows for gathering large amounts of data quickly and efficiently compared to manual collection methods such as ground surveys or sensor networks. However, it should be noted that using publicly available datasets was not mentioned in this context.
