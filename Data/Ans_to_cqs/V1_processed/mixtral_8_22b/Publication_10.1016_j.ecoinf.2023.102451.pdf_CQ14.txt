The text does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters were optimized, such as using grid search or random search. However, it mentions that the learning rate was set to 0.002 and the batch size was set to 32. This suggests that these values were determined through some form of hyperparameter tuning process, but the exact methodology is not specified.
