Based on the given context, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is digital images. Specifically, the study uses photographs for training and testing the performance of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for binary classification. The photographs are first split into 50 x 50 pixel tiles to match the size of the training samples. Before splitting, all photographs are resized to a maximum width of 2500 pixels to reduce computing time. Therefore, the data format used in this deep learning pipeline is digital images.
