After training the Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) model using either the incremental or zero-start training modes, the authors deployed their trained model onto different platforms for testing purposes. For instance, they utilized a platform equipped with a 3.6 GHz central processing unit (CPU) and 32 GB of memory to evaluate the incrementally trained DCNN model. Additionally, they employed another Dell PowerEdge C4130 rack server featuring dual Tesla K80 GPUs and 256 GB of memory to assess both the zero-start and incrementally trained models. However, the paper does not explicitly mention any specifics regarding model serialization or other deployment details beyond these hardware configurations.
