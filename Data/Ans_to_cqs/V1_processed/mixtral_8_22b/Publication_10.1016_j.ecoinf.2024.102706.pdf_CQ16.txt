Based on the given context, there isn't explicit mention of specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, some common methods used in machine learning include monitoring the validation loss or accuracy during training and stopping when these metrics reach a plateau or no longer improve significantly. Another approach could be setting a fixed number of epochs or iterations for training. In this case, a 5-fold cross-validation grid search strategy was implemented to tune hyperparameters within the training dataset for all machine learning models. This suggests that the training process might have been stopped based on the performance achieved after tuning the hyperparameters. Nonetheless, without more detailed information about the exact training procedure followed, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer regarding the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.
