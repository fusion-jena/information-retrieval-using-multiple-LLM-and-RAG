After the model training phase, there are several postprocessing steps involved in producing iceplant location maps and coverage statistics. These include applying the trained model to classify all vegetation pixels in the NAIP scenes covering the study area, conducting an accuracy assessment on the map, and generating a confusion matrix for the assessment sample classification. Additionally, structures such as roads and buildings, as well as water bodies, were removed from the images to prevent them from slowing down the classification processing. The final dataset created for this project includes 5442 confirmed iceplant and other vegetation points, which were used to train the model and achieve desired accuracy targets.
