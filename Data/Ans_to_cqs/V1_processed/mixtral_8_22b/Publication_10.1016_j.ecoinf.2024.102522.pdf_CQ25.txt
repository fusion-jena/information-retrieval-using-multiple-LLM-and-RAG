The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, based on the information available, it can be inferred that the model might be used for classification purposes. This is suggested by the presence of a 'classification table' and the use of logistic regression analysis, which are commonly employed in classification tasks. Nevertheless, without further details about the specific application or objective of the study, this remains speculative.
