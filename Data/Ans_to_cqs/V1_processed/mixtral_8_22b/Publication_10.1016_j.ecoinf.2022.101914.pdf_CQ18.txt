The authors monitored the performance of the models during training by setting aside an evaluation dataset before training the models. This dataset was then used to calculate the True Skill Statistic (TSS) and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve (AUC-ROC) for each model. These metrics helped determine the optimal number of background points for each individual modeling approach. Additionally, the authors also compared the performance of various ensemble models against a single component model built with suboptimal training data. They found that Random Forest (RF) outperformed all the ensemble models, suggesting that researchers should consider using RF when employing a single modeling approach. However, it was noted that RF was more sensitive to the number of background points used to train the model than other modeling methods. Despite this sensitivity, the authors concluded that using an ensemble of models can help overcome any issues that may arise from relying solely on a single model.
