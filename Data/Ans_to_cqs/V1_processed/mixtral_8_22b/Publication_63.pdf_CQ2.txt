In the given context, the authors discuss the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for extracting plant functional traits from simple RGB photographs. They mention feeding bioclimatic data into the CNN along with the images. Additionally, they experiment with an ensemble approach using two more state-of-the-art model architectures, namely Xception and MobileNetV2. From this information, we can infer that the main data format used in their deep learning pipeline is image data (RGB photographs), while additional contextual data includes bioclimatic data. However, the specific file format or structure of these data sources is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
