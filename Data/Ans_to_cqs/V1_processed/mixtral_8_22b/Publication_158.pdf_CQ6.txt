The text does not provide explicit information about specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it mentions certain techniques applied during the training process that can be considered part of preprocessing. These include data augmentation methods like rotation, reflectance bias, and adding random noise to increase sample variation. Additionally, early stopping criteria were employed to prevent overfitting, and batch normalization was applied after all convolution or dense layers, excluding the final output. Dropout layers were also incorporated to enhance generalization. While these do not directly address traditional preprocessing steps, they contribute significantly to preparing the dataset for effective training.
