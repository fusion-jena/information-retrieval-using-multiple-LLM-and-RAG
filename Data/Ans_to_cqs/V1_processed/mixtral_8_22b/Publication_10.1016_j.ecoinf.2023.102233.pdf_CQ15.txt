Based on the given context, it appears that the authors utilized a grid search technique to optimize the hyperparameters of their Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. This method involves systematically testing various combinations of hyperparameters to find the best configuration for the model. However, the specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot definitively state which optimization techniques were employed in this study.
