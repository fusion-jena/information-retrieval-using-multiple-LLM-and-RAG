The context does not provide explicit details on the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning models used in the studies mentioned. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning applications to employ techniques such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, and stratified splitting to improve the robustness and generalization capabilities of these models.

Diverse datasets involve training models on a wide range of input data, which helps them learn more effectively and perform better when presented with new or unseen data. Cross-validation is a technique where the available data is divided into multiple subsets, and the model is trained and tested iteratively on different combinations of these subsets. This process provides insights into how well the model performs across various scenarios and reduces the risk of overfitting.

Stratified splitting refers to dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes or labels in both sets. This approach ensures that the model is exposed to a representative sample of each class during training, leading to improved performance and reduced bias.

While the context does not explicitly mention these methods being employed, they are commonly used best practices in developing and validating deep learning models. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that similar strategies may have been applied in the research discussed in the context.
