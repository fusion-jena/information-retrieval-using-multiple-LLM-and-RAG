After the model training, several postprocessing steps can be taken depending on the specific requirements of the project. Some common postprocessing steps include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, and creating confusion matrices.

Saliency maps help visualize the parts of the input data that have the highest impact on the model's output. This can provide insights into how the model makes its decisions and identify any potential biases or issues with the input data.

Calculating various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., helps assess the overall performance of the model. These metrics can also aid in comparing different models and identifying areas where improvements can be made.

Creating confusion matrices provides a more detailed view of the model's performance by showing the number of correct and incorrect classifications for each class. This can highlight any imbalanced classes or misclassification patterns that may require further attention.

In addition to these general postprocessing steps, there might be other domain-specific tasks required based on the application. For instance, in acoustic modeling, postprocessing could involve error detection, input selection, and detecting rare events. The mentioned methods like EV (Embedding Visualization) can assist in selecting the best candidate samples for manual annotation and detecting rare events during deployment.
