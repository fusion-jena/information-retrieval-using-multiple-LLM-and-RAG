Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to provide the exact code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that "Data and code are available as supplementary material to the article." This suggests that the code might not be publicly accessible through platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket but could potentially be found within the supplementary materials accompanying the research paper. To access this, you would need to refer to the original source of the article.
