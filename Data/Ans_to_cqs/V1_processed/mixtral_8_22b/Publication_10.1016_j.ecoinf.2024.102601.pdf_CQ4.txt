The given context does not provide information about any specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, some common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, and shifting images. These techniques help increase the size of the dataset and improve the generalizability of the trained model. In the case of wildfire detection, these techniques could potentially be useful for creating more diverse examples of fire-affected areas.
