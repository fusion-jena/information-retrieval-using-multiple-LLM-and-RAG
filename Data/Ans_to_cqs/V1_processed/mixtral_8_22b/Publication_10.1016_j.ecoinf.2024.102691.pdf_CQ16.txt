The text does not explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it can be inferred from the information given that the models were trained for a fixed number of epochs (300) and then evaluated on the validation set after each epoch. This suggests that the completion of training may have been determined by reaching this predefined number of epochs rather than by observing a validation loss plateau or other similar metric.
