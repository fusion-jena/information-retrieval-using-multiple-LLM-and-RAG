The pipeline uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as the deep learning model. This is evident from several parts of the given text. Firstly, the text explicitly mentions that "a CNN is a type of neural network commonly used for image classification." Secondly, the process of creating a metadata.csv file for training the CNN and k-NN further confirms the use of a CNN. Lastly, the figure caption for Figure 1 also refers to the training of a CNN in the DialectDecoder pipeline. Therefore, based on these references, it can be concluded that the pipeline employs a CNN as the deep learning model.
