In this study, the raw data collection methods for the deep learning pipeline involve field data collection and image processing. Specifically, sample plots are collected, and image processing techniques are applied to generate a tabulated dataset. This dataset includes on-field Above Ground Biomass (AGB) and independent features. The study does not explicitly mention the use of surveys, sensors, or public datasets for data collection. Instead, it focuses on utilizing Sentinel 1A and Landsat images along with ground survey data for estimating Above Ground Biomass (AGB) using machine learning algorithms like LightGBM and XGBoost.
