According to the provided context, the study utilized a training-and-test approach with stratification splitting. This means that the dataset was divided into two parts - a training set and a test set. Stratification splitting ensures that both sets maintain the same proportion of observations with respect to the output variable. Furthermore, it is mentioned that this process was repeated 100 times with different splits to ensure robustness and reliability of the results. However, there is no explicit mention of a separate validation set in the provided context. Therefore, we can only infer that the study employed a training set and a test set for its deep learning model training.
