The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is not explicitly stated as either classification, segmentation, or detection. However, it can be inferred from the given information that the model is being used for regression, specifically for predicting the SPAD value. This is evident from the description of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) implementation, where the final layer contains only one node, which is intended to output the predicted SPAD value. Additionally, the use of the term 'predictor' suggests that the model is being employed to forecast or estimate a continuous variable, rather than classifying discrete categories or detecting objects within images. Therefore, although the exact terminology of 'classification','segmentation', or 'detection' is not mentioned, it can be deduced that the deep learning model is serving a regression function in this scenario.
