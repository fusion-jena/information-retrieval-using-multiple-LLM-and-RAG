The article does not provide information about the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. It focuses on describing the development and application of a deep learning-integrated LUCC reconstruction model (DLURM), using Zhenlai County of Jilin Province as an example. The paper discusses the limitations of traditional LUCC reconstruction models and presents the advantages of using deep learning methods for LUCC analysis. However, it does not mention any specific code repository links or share any source code related to the deep learning pipeline used in their research.
