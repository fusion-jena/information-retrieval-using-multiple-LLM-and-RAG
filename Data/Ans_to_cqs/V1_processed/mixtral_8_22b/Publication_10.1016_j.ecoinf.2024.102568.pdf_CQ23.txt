The text does not explicitly mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it can be inferred from the context that the authors have employed some form of validation by dividing their dataset into training and testing sets. This is evident from the use of terms like 'training set', 'test set', and 'out of range'. Additionally, they have also mentioned the use of a separate validation experiment (Exp.3), which suggests that they might have used a three-way split of their dataset into training, validation, and testing sets. Nevertheless, the exact methodology used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model remains unclear based on the given information.
