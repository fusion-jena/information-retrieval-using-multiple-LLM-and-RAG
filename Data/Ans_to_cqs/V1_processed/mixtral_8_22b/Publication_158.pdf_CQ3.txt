The text does not provide explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that segmentation-based approaches were considered as an alternative method for handling various object sizes and scales. This suggests that instance segmentation might have been explored during the development process. Instance segmentation involves labeling each individual object within an image at the pixel level, which would help address the issue of objects being represented as a single pixel or large assemblages. The text also indicates that sufficient quality training data for segmentation was a limitation, implying that they may have faced challenges in obtaining accurate and reliable segmented datasets. Unfortunately, there is no mention of other data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotations or semantic segmentation.
