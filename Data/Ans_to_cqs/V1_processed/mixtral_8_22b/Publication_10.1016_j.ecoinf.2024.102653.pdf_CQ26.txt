The text does not provide explicit information on specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that individuals from the control and pesticide-exposed groups were evenly distributed between the training and testing subsets, ensuring a balanced representation of each class. This suggests that stratified sampling or similar methods might have been employed to maintain class balance and mitigate potential biases. Additionally, the use of conventional performance metrics like confusion matrices, accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, Cohen Kappa, and the area under the ROC curve indicates that the authors paid attention to evaluating their model's performance with respect to different aspects of imbalance and bias. Nonetheless, without further details, we cannot confirm whether other techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection were also implemented.
