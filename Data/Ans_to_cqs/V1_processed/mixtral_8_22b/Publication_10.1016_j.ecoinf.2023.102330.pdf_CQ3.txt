The given context does not provide explicit information on the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on common practices in deep learning pipelines for audio analysis, we can infer some possible methods.

For audio data, labeling typically involves identifying the start and end times of sounds of interest within the audio files. This could be considered analogous to bounding box annotation in image data, where regions of interest are identified and labeled.

In the case of bird sound recognition mentioned in the context, the labels might correspond to different bird species. The process of assigning these labels to segments of audio data could be done manually, semi-automatically, or automatically depending on the resources available and the desired level of accuracy.

Data augmentation is also mentioned in the context, which is a technique often used in deep learning to increase the amount of training data. This can involve creating new examples from existing ones through transformations such as shifting time, changing pitch, or adding background noise. These transformed versions can then be treated as additional examples during training.

However, without more specific details about the deep learning pipeline used in this study, we cannot definitively state what data annotation techniques were employed.
