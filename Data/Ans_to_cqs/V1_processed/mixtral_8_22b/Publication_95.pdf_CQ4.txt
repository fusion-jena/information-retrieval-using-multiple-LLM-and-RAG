In this study, the following three-step data augmentation procedure was applied to the images during training before being processed by the network:

1. Randomly flip image horizontally: This technique involves flipping the image along its horizontal axis. It helps the model generalize better by creating new variations of the existing images.

2. Scale the contrast of each image channel by a random factor between 0.8 and 1.2: This step adjusts the contrast of the image channels within a certain range. By doing so, the model becomes more robust to changes in lighting conditions and color intensity.

3. Randomly crop the image to a square with side lengths equal to the image height: This technique crops the original image into a square shape, which maintains the aspect ratio. Cropping the image randomly allows the model to focus on different parts of the image, improving its ability to recognize features regardless of their position.
