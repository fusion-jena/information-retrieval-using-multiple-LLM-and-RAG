The text discusses the use of Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) with various ResNet architectures (ResNet18, ResNet34, and ResNet152) for object detection in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) thermal images. To evaluate the performance of these models, the Average Precision (AP) metric is primarily used. AP is a popular evaluation metric for object detection tasks, which considers both precision and recall values. In this case, the AP is calculated separately for small, medium, and large objects based on their size in pixels.

According to the given context, the FRC\_ResNet152FPN model achieves the highest AP for small objects (78.3%) compared to other models like FRC\_ResNet18FPN and FRC\_ResNet34FPN. This indicates that FRC\_ResNet152FPN provides better detection precision and recall trade-offs, thus being more effective overall. The superior performance of FRC\_ResNet152FPN for small objects is attributed to its ability to extract more abstractly semantic information due to having more convolutional neural network (CNN) layers.

In summary, the primary metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models discussed in the given context is Average Precision (AP). Other common metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall are not explicitly mentioned but could also be relevant when evaluating object detection models.
