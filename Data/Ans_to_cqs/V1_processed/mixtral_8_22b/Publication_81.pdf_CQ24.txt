Based on the given context, there is no direct mention or discussion about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some common strategies to manage randomness in deep learning models include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using techniques like cross-validation, ensemble methods, or bagging to reduce variance, and applying regularization methods like dropout or weight decay to prevent overfitting. These strategies help ensure consistent and reliable results when working with deep learning models.
