The text does not explicitly mention which specific evaluation metrics are used to assess the performance of the deep learning model. However, based on common practices in machine learning and deep learning, some commonly used metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, confusion matrix, ROC curve, AUC, etc. In this case, the text mentions that the MRS\_DeepLabV3+ model achieved an accuracy enhancement of around 3% compared to the DeepLabV3+ model. Therefore, one can infer that accuracy might be one of the evaluation metrics used in this study. Additionally, the text mentions that the MRS\_DeepLabV3+ model was able to solve the problem of fragmented spatial edge information often encountered when using pixel-based CNNs to extract target categories. This suggests that the model's ability to accurately classify different land cover types might have been evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, or F1 score. However, without explicit confirmation from the authors, these assumptions should be taken with caution.
