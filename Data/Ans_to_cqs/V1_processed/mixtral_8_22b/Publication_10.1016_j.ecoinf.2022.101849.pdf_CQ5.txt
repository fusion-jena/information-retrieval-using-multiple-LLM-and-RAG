The information provided does not mention any specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the text discusses a new computational setting for regression in predictive modeling of global vegetation cover, focusing on the prediction of Potential Natural Vegetation (PNV). It also mentions various statistical techniques and machine learning methods like neural networks, random forests, gradient boosting, and k-nearest neighbors being employed for PNV mapping. However, there is no explicit reference to any commonly used deep learning datasets.
