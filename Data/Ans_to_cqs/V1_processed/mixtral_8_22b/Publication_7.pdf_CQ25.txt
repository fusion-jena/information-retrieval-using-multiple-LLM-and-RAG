The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is for image classification. Specifically, it aims to automatically annotate marine images, focusing on identifying different types of corals and other marine organisms. The model uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or deep networks, which are fine-tuned using the Benthoz15 dataset containing expert-annotated and geo-referenced marine images from Australian seas. The goal is to free up experts from the tedious task of manual annotation and enable rapid and accurate processing of massive datasets, ultimately contributing to better monitoring and understanding of marine ecosystems.
