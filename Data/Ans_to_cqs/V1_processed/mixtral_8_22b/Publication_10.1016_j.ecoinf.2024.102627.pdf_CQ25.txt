The purpose of the deep learning model described here is to optimize a model that returns likely species assemblages worldwide based on a set of presence-only observations. This is achieved by using a deep species distribution model (SDM) that is trained on multi-species presence-only data and then used to predict sets of labels by thresholding the SDM output categorical probabilities associated with species. Essentially, the goal is to create a system that can accurately predict which species will be present together in different locations around the globe based solely on environmental factors such as climate, soil type, human activity, and geographic region.
