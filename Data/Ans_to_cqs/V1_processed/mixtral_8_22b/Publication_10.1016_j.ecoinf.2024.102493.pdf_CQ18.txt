Based on the given context, there is no direct mention of any specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it can be inferred that the Q value, which measures the explanatory power of each driver in the OPGD, could potentially serve as an indicator of model performance. By comparing the Q values for each driver at various grid scales, the optimal sampling grid can be selected based on the criterion that the 90% quartile is the largest. This approach might indirectly help monitor the model performance during training. Nevertheless, without explicit details about the monitoring strategy, it cannot be definitively stated what exact method is employed to track the model performance during training.
