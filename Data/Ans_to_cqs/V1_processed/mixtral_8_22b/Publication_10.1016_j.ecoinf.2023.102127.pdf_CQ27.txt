The provided context does not contain information about the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based solely on this context. However, common practices for deploying a trained deep learning model include model serialization, platform selection, and containerization using tools like Docker or Kubernetes. These steps help ensure the portability and scalability of the deployed model.

Based on the references provided, it appears that the context discusses topics related to ecology, modeling, and statistical analysis rather than deep learning model deployment. For instance, the paper by Fois et al. (2018) focuses on using species distribution models at a local scale, while Friedman et al. (2010) present regularization paths for generalized linear models. Similarly, Gabry et al. (2014) discuss the use of Maxent in ecological modeling, and Guisan & Thuiller (2005) explore predictive species distribution models. None of these papers directly address the topic of deploying a trained deep learning model.
