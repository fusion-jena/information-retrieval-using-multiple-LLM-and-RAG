Unfortunately, based on the given information, it does not appear that there is any explicit mention of where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, without additional context or information, it is not possible to determine which specific data repository (such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, etc.) contains the relevant data for this deep learning pipeline.
