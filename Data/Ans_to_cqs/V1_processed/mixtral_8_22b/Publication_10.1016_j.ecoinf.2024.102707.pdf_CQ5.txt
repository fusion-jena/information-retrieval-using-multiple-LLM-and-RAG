The text does not provide specific information on the dataset used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions using various sets of hyperparameters in YOLOv6 and testing different spatial resolutions of imagery without specifying the source or type of data. Additionally, the authors have made their data available alongside the publication, suggesting they may have used custom datasets tailored to their specific application. Unfortunately, without further details, I cannot determine the exact datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
