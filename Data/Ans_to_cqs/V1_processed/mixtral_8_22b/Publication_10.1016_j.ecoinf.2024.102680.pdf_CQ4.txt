Based on the given context, it appears that one data augmentation technique mentioned is mosaic data augmentation. Mosaic data augmentation involves combining four training images into one image in a random manner. It helps improve the diversity of the dataset and allows the model to learn from different combinations of images. Other common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, and adjusting brightness and contrast. However, the context does not explicitly mention whether these specific techniques were also applied in this case. Therefore, based on the available information, I can confirm that mosaic data augmentation was used, but further details regarding additional data augmentation techniques are not provided.
