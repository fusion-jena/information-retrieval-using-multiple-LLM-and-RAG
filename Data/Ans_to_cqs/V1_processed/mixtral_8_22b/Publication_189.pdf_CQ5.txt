In the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does state that the dataset used in the proposed system was collected from scratch using a KaKaXi fixed camera. This camera took images every hour within a fixed period of time each day, and these images were saved into a database. Therefore, the dataset used in this particular deep learning pipeline appears to be a custom one, not a standard dataset commonly used in deep learning applications.
