The text does not explicitly state which specific hardware resources were used for training the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the softmax function took 12 minutes on the GPU to complete the same task as the proposed method, which ran in approximately 1.2 minutes on the CPU. This suggests that both CPUs and GPUs were utilized during the experimentation process. Additionally, the training and validation of the classifier were run on a basic laptop using its CPU (Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9850H, CPU clock speed = 2.60 GHz), indicating that CPUs were also employed for these tasks. Unfortunately, there is no mention of any other specialized hardware such as TPUs being used.
