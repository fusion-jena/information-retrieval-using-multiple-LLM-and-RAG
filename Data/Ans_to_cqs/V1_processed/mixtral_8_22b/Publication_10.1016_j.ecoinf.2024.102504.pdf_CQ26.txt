The papers mentioned do not directly discuss specific techniques to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some general approaches can be considered based on common practices in machine learning and deep learning applications. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting is a technique used to maintain the original class proportions when dividing the dataset into training and testing sets. This ensures that both subsets have similar distributions, which helps prevent overfitting or underfitting due to imbalanced classes.

Oversampling involves duplicating samples from the minority class(es) to balance the dataset. This can help improve the performance of the model on the minority class but may lead to overfitting if not handled carefully. Undersampling, on the other hand, removes samples from the majority class(es) to achieve balanced datasets. While this approach reduces the risk of overfitting, it might discard valuable information contained within the removed samples.

Diverse data collection aims to gather more representative data by including examples from all possible scenarios, ensuring that the trained model performs well across various conditions. This method can mitigate biases introduced by limited or unrepresentative datasets.

In summary, while the given references do not explicitly mention these techniques, they are commonly employed methods to tackle data bias during preprocessing in deep learning pipelines.
