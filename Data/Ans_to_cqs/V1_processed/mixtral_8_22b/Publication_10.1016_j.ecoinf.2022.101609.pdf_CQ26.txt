Based on the given context, it does not provide explicit information about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, there are several common techniques used to handle data bias such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes within each set. Oversampling increases the number of minority class samples by duplicating them, whereas undersampling reduces the majority class samples to balance the dataset. Diverse data collection aims to gather more representative data from different sources to reduce bias.

Without further context, I cannot determine which technique was specifically applied in this case. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, I do not know what techniques were used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
