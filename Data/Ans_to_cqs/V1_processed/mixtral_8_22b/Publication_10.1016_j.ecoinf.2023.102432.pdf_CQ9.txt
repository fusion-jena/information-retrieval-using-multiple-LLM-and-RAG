Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of the specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding its availability on platforms such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. It would be best to refer back to the original source material or contact the authors directly for more detailed information about the data repository.
