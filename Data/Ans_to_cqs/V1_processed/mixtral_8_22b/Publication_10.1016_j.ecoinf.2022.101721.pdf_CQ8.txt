The text does not provide information about where the code repository for the deep learning pipeline is located. It only mentions that there is an R-code available in supplement S1, but it does not specify where this supplement can be found or if it includes a link to a code repository. Therefore, I do not know where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
