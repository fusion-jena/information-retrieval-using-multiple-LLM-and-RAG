The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, based on common practices in deep learning, some possible postprocessing steps could include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics such as accuracy or F1 score, creating a confusion matrix, or performing cross-validation. These techniques help evaluate the performance of the trained model and identify areas for improvement. It is important to note that these methods may vary depending on the specific application and goals of the project.
