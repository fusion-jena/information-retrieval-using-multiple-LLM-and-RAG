The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer based on the information available. However, common methods used for hyperparameter optimization include grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and gradient-based optimization. Grid search involves testing all combinations of hyperparameters within a predefined range, while random search randomly selects combinations of hyperparameters to test. Bayesian optimization uses a probabilistic approach to find the optimal set of hyperparameters, and gradient-based optimization uses gradients to iteratively update the hyperparameters towards their optimal values. Without further information, it cannot be determined which method was used for this particular model.
