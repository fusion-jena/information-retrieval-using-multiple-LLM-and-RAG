The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of DNA barcode sequences as input data for the deep learning model. DNA barcode sequences are typically obtained through laboratory techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and sequencing of specific gene regions. These techniques involve extracting DNA from fish tissue samples and then targeting and amplifying specific genes or gene regions that serve as unique identifiers for different fish species. Once these DNA sequences have been generated, they can be processed and converted into numerical data suitable for analysis by the deep learning model.
