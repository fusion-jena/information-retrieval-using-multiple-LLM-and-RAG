Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available from the given context to provide the exact data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. However, it is clear that the authors have developed a new model called SeedNet, which is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), for single seed classification and retrieval tasks. They compared their proposed model with other existing CNN models using two different datasets. The performance of these models was evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc. The authors found that their proposed model outperformed the other models in terms of retrieval performance when using Euclidean distance as the similarity measure. It would be helpful if more details about the data repository were provided so that I could give a more specific answer.
