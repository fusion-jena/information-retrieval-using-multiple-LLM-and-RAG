Unfortunately, none of the sources mentioned provide specific information about where the data repositories of the deep learning pipelines are available. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which data repository contains the relevant data for each study. However, some common data repositories used for scientific research include Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, and GBIF. Researchers may have chosen to use one or more of these platforms to store and share their data. To find out where the data repository of a particular study is located, readers can refer to the original publication or contact the authors directly.
