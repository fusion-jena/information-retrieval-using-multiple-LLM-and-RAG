The given context does not provide specific details about the use of regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization in a deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of a regularization multiplier ranging from 0.5 to 5 in the context of determining the best tuning parameters for a model. This suggests that some form of regularization was applied during the modeling process, although the exact method remains unclear without additional context.
