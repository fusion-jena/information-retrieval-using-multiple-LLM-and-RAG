The authors split their annotated dataset called 'AnnotationsActions' randomly but fixed for all experiments and all networks into a train set, validation set, and test set. They allocated 20% of the video clips from each class to form the test set. From the remaining clips, another 20% of the clips in each class were assigned to create the validation set. The rest of the clips formed the training set.
