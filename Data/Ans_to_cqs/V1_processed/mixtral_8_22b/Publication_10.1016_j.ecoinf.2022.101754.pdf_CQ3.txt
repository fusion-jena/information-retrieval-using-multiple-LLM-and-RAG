Based on the provided context, there is no information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. These techniques help to label or tag datasets so they can be used to train machine learning algorithms. Without more specific details about the dataset or the deep learning pipeline used in this case, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
