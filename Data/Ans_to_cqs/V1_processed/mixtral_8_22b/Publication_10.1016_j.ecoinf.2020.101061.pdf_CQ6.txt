Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps may be involved depending on the specific requirements of the task and the nature of the input data. Based on the given context, one such step mentioned is normalization. Specifically, the RGB channels of the image data were normalized by subtracting the ImageNet mean from each channel. This step helps to standardize the input data and ensure that different features contribute equally during the learning process. Additionally, data augmentation techniques like random flips and translations were also tested but found to have little effect on the final score. However, it should be noted that other common preprocessing steps not explicitly mentioned here include scaling, cleaning, or transforming the data into a suitable format for the model. Scaling involves adjusting the values of numeric columns to a certain range, typically between 0 and 1, which can help improve the convergence speed and accuracy of the model. Cleaning refers to handling missing or inconsistent data points, while transforming the data might involve encoding categorical variables or converting text data into numerical representations.
