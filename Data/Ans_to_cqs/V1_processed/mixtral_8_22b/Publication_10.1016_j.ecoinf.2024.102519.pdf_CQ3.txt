The given context does not provide information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it is important to note that these techniques are commonly used in computer vision tasks involving object detection and recognition. In bounding box annotation, a rectangular box is drawn around each object of interest within an image, while instance segmentation involves labeling individual pixels belonging to different objects. Other popular data annotation techniques include semantic segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and text annotation. The choice of technique depends on the specific task requirements and available resources.
