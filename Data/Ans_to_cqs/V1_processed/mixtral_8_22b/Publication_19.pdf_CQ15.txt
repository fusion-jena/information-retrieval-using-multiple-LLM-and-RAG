The text mentions that Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) was used as the optimizer for all four models. No other optimization techniques are explicitly mentioned in the given context. Therefore, based on the information available, it appears that SGD was the primary optimization technique employed in the deep learning pipeline.
