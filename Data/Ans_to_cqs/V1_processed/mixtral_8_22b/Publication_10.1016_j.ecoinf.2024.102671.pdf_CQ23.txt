The text does not explicitly mention any specific deep learning model or its application in the given context. However, there is a reference to the use of cross-validation techniques for assessing the predictive accuracy and robustness of ecological zoning methods. This suggests that the authors acknowledge the importance of ensuring the generalizability of their models. While the details regarding the implementation of these cross-validation techniques are not mentioned, they can be used to validate the performance of various types of models, including deep learning models. Cross-validation involves dividing the available data into training and testing sets multiple times, allowing the model to learn from different subsets of the data and providing a more accurate estimate of its performance on unseen data. In summary, although the text does not directly address the use of diverse datasets or stratified splitting, it does indicate the use of cross-validation techniques to enhance the generalizability of the ecological zoning methods employed in the study.
