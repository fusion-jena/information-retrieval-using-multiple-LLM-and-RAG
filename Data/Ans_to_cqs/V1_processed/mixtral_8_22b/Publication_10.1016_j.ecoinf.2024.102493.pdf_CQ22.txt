Based on the given context, there is no direct mention of any specific evaluation metrics used for evaluating the performance of a deep learning model such as accuracy, precision, or recall. However, it does discuss various aspects related to the calculation of the Q statistic, which is used to determine the explanatory power of each driver factor on the spatial variability of the kNDVI. This involves calculating variances, sample sizes, and square sums for both individual strata and the entire region. Additionally, the text mentions comparing the 90% quartiles of the Q values for all drivers at different spatial scales to select the optimal sampling grid. Nonetheless, these calculations do not directly correspond to traditional machine learning or deep learning evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, or recall.
