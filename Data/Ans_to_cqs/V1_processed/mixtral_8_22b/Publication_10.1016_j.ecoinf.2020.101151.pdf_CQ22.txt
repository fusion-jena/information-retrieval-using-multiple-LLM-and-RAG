The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, based on common practices in machine learning and deep learning, some possible metrics could include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC, or other domain-specific evaluation measures. In the given context, there is no clear indication of what metrics were used to assess the performance of the deep learning model. Therefore, without additional information, we cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
