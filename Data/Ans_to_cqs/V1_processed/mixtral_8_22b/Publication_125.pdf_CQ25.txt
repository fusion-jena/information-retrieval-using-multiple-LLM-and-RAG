Based on the information provided, it appears that the deep learning model being discussed is used for semantic segmentation. Semantic segmentation is a type of pixel-level prediction task where the goal is to assign a label or category to every pixel in an image. This technique is often used in computer vision applications such as object recognition, scene understanding, and autonomous driving.

In this case, the authors mention conducting semantic segmentation to extract four classes - urban, bare soil, vegetation, and road - from satellite images. Each resulting image contains both the real value of pixels of the extracted class and zeros for the values of the other classes. These images are then divided into non-overlapping blocks of 256 x 256 pixels and saved into folders named after their respective classes.

Additionally, the paper mentions using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the experimental setup. CNNs are commonly used for image analysis tasks like semantic segmentation due to their ability to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features from data. Therefore, based on these details, we can infer that the primary purpose of the deep learning model is semantic segmentation of satellite imagery.
