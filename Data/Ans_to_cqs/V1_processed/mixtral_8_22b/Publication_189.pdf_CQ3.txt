In the given context, the primary data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline is instance segmentation. This involves manually labeling or outlining the borders of objects within images to associate each pixel of the object with a specific tag or label. The process is carried out using the Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT) developed by Intel. After annotation, the data is converted into the COCO 1.0 dataset format, which includes information such as object ID, image ID, category ID, segmentation, area, bounding box, and attributes.

Instance segmentation is a more detailed approach compared to other methods like bounding box annotation. While bounding box annotation only requires drawing a rectangle around the object, instance segmentation demands precise outlines of the object's shape. This makes it a more time-consuming task but also provides richer and more accurate data for training deep learning models.

Other data annotation techniques mentioned indirectly in the context include semantic segmentation and region of interest extraction. Semantic segmentation involves classifying each pixel in an image into a specific category, while region of interest extraction focuses on identifying and extracting relevant parts of an image for further processing. However, these techniques are not explicitly stated as being used in the described deep learning pipeline.
