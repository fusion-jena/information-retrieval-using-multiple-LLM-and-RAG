Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model. However, some common preprocessing steps often employed when working with deep learning models include data normalization, scaling, cleaning, and augmentation. Data normalization involves transforming the dataset so that its values fall within a certain range, typically between 0 and 1. Scaling can be done using various methods, such as min-max scaling or standardization, to ensure that all features contribute equally during the training process. Cleaning the data may involve removing outliers, missing values, or irrelevant information from the dataset. Lastly, data augmentation techniques can help increase the amount of available training data by applying random transformations to existing samples, thereby improving the robustness and generalizability of the trained model.
