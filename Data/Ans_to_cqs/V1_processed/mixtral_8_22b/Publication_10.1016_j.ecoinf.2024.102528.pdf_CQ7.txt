Unfortunately, based on the given context, there isn't enough information to determine the exact criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (train, test, validation). However, it can be inferred that the BirdNET-Analyzer deep learning model has been trained using some dataset, but details about how the data was divided or what percentage was allocated for training, testing, and validation are not explicitly stated in the provided text.

Typical practices involve splitting datasets into different subsets such as training, validation, and testing sets. A common approach is to use around 70-80% of the data for training, 10-15% for validation, and another 10-15% for testing. This division helps ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data and prevents overfitting during the training process.

Since the context does not provide explicit information regarding the data splitting criteria, I cannot give a definitive answer. It would require access to additional resources or documentation related to the BirdNET-Analyzer project to find more detailed information about its data splitting methodology.
