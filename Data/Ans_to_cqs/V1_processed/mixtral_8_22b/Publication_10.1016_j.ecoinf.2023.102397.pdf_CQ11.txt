Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to provide a direct link to the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that ARBIMON (Automated Remote Biodiversity Monitoring Network) is linked to the Rainforest Connection website (<https://arbimon.rfcx.org/>). This might not be the exact data repository link for the deep learning pipeline but could potentially lead to more resources related to this topic.
