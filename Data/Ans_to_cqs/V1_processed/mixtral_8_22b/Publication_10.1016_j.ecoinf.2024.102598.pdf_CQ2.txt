The given context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the context that the study focuses on forest fire susceptibility using various machine learning models such as Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), Boosted Regression Tree (BRT), and Classification and Regression Tree (CART). These models typically use structured data formats such as CSV or tabular data containing features related to forest fires. It is important to note that the context does not discuss any deep learning techniques but rather emphasizes traditional machine learning models. Therefore, without additional information, it cannot be determined if the study uses other data formats such as images, videos, or audio files in its deep learning pipeline.

Based on the context, it appears that the study primarily utilizes structured data formats such as CSV or tabular data for input into their machine learning models. However, further clarification would be needed to confirm whether the study employs different data formats in a potential deep learning pipeline.
