Based on the given context, it can be inferred that the data format used in this study is primarily remote sensing data, specifically GF-6 (WFV) data obtained from the China Centre for Resources Satellite Data and Application. This type of data is typically in the form of digital images, which are then processed through radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction, geometric correction, and image cropping before being fed into the deep learning pipeline. The context does not mention any other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV files being used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it can be concluded that the primary data format used in this study is digital images.
