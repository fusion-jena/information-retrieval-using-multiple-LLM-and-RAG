The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is to classify a selection of coralligenous species or their broader taxonomical groups. Additionally, it aims to assess the biodiversity and ecological status of coralligenous reefs. To achieve these goals, the authors have developed a custom methodology based on state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures and a large database of annotated photographic quadrats. They perform several analyses, including training simple CNNs on different patch sizes and building an ensemble network for multi-scale prediction, as well as training a logistic regression (LR) on deeply learned features from intermediate layers to enhance performance and calibrate the ensemble network.
