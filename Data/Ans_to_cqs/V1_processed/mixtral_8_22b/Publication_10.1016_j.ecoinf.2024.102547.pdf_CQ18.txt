The text does not provide explicit information about the specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, it can be inferred that the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) were used as metrics to evaluate the performance of the models during training and testing phases. These are common evaluation metrics used in machine learning and statistical modeling to assess how well a model performs. Additionally, R^2 values are also presented, which indicate the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables in the model. Therefore, it appears that these metrics were employed to track the progress and effectiveness of the models throughout the training process.
