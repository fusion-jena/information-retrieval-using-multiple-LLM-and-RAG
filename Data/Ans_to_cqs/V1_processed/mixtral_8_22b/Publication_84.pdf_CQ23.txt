The article does not provide explicit details on the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it mentions the use of a deep learning classifier that optimizes the use of phenological information yielded from Ppf-CM. Additionally, Google Earth Engine (GEE) is used as a platform for handling large amounts of data, which could potentially contribute to the robustness and generalizability of the model. Nevertheless, without clear mention of techniques such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, one cannot definitively state what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
