The criterion used to determine when training is complete in this case is when the cross-validation accuracy reaches its highest level during the Recursive Feature Elimination and Cross-Validation (RFECV) process. This means that the model has been trained to a point where it can accurately classify the validation samples using the selected features. The RFECV process involves removing features with the lowest importance scores from the current feature combinations and repeating this process recursively until the cross-validation accuracy reaches its peak. In this study, a five-fold cross-validation was used to select the number and combinations of features. However, there is no mention of other common criteria such as validation loss plateau or early stopping being used in this particular study.
