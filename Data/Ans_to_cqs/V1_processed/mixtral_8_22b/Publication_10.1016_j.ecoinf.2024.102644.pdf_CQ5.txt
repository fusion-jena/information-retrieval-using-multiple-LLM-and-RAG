The text does not provide information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that there were 17 datasets obtained after applying a data pre-processing algorithm. These datasets include one each for evapotranspiration (ET), wind speed (WS), and carbon dioxide concentration (C); seven datasets for temperature (T); and seven datasets for precipitation (P). These datasets were used as proxy environmental conditions for annual environmental snapshots in the years 1950, 1999, 2016, 2050, and 2100 under different climate change scenarios. Unfortunately, without more specific details, I cannot determine if any of these datasets correspond to well-known machine learning datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
