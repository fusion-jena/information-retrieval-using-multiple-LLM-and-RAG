Based on the provided context, there isn't any explicit mention or discussion regarding addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer based solely on the given text. However, these techniques are commonly employed to mitigate data imbalance issues and improve the performance of deep learning models.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets ensuring that the distribution of target variables remains consistent across different sets. Oversampling increases the number of instances in minority classes, whereas undersampling reduces instances in majority classes to balance the dataset. Lastly, collecting diverse data helps ensure that the model generalizes well to various scenarios and populations.
