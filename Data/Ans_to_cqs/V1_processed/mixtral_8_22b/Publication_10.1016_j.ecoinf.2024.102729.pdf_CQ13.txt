Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide a helpful response regarding the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model mentioned in the given context. However, common hyperparameters used in deep learning models include learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, optimizer type (such as Adam or Stochastic Gradient Descent), and regularization parameters like dropout rate or weight decay. These hyperparameters can significantly impact the performance of the model and require careful tuning through processes such as grid search or random search.
