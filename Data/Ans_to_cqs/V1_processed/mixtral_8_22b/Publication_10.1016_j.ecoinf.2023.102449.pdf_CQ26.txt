In the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection being employed to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss a technique to mitigate the effect of hardware variance on the learned representation. This technique involves applying a simple linear transformation after the initial convolution operation in the pre-processing block. The aim of this transformation is to counteract the potential bias introduced by frequency responses that vary across different hardware devices. Therefore, while not directly addressing data bias in terms of class imbalance or diversity, this approach attempts to ensure that the learned representations remain consistent despite variations in recording equipment.
