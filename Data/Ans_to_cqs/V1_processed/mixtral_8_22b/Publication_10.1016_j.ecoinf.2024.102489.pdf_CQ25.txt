The text does not provide explicit information about the specific purpose or type of the deep learning model used in the study. However, it mentions that the study utilized various machine learning algorithms, including deep neural networks, to estimate leaf parameters for wheat leaves. It also states that these deep neural networks improved the prediction accuracy of leaf parameters. Based on this information, we can infer that the deep learning model used in the study might have been employed for regression purposes, specifically to predict leaf parameters with higher accuracy.
