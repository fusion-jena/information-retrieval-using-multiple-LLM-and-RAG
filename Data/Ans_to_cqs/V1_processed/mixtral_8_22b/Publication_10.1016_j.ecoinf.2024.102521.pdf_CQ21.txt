Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it can be inferred from the description of the STARdbi\_inference process that some form of postprocessing might occur during the inference stage. This could include generating predictions for each input image and merging overlapping bounding boxes to form the final prediction. Additionally, since the authors mention evaluating the performance of their custom-made AI-based classification models, it can be assumed that they calculate metrics and possibly generate confusion matrices to assess the accuracy of these models. But without more detailed information, it cannot be confirmed what exact postprocessing steps are taken after the model training.
