In the given context, there isn't explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, specifically regarding the use of random seed values. However, we can infer some strategies from the mentioned techniques used in building the deep neural network (DNN) model.

One strategy to manage randomness in DNNs is the use of dropout layers. Dropout is a regularization technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent overfitting. By introducing randomness into the network, it forces other neurons to learn more robust features, making the model more resilient to noise and variations in input data.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of batch normalization layers. Batch normalization standardizes the inputs to a layer for each mini-batch, reducing internal covariate shift and allowing faster convergence. This technique also introduces some level of randomness since the mean and variance used for normalization are calculated per mini-batch.

While not explicitly stated, another common practice to control randomness in deep learning pipelines is setting a fixed random seed value. A random seed value initializes the pseudorandom number generator, ensuring reproducibility across experiments. Setting a consistent seed value allows researchers to reproduce their results and compare them accurately.

Lastly, the context discusses the optimization of hyperparameters like learning rate, number of epochs, and batch size. Hyperparameter tuning can help mitigate the effects of randomness by finding optimal configurations that improve model performance and reduce variability. Techniques such as grid search or random search can be employed to find the best combination of hyperparameters.

In summary, while the given context does not directly address managing randomness in the deep learning pipeline using random seed values, it implies several strategies such as employing dropout layers, utilizing batch normalization, setting a fixed random seed value, and performing hyperparameter tuning.
