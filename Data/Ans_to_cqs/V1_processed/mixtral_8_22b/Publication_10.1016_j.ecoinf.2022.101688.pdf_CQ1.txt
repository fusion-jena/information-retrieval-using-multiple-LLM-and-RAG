The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is implied that bioacoustic datasets are being used, which suggests that audio recordings or soundscapes might have been collected using recording devices such as microphones or acoustic sensors. These recordings could potentially come from field surveys, sensor networks, or publicly available datasets. It is also possible that the researchers themselves conducted fieldwork to collect the necessary audio data. Nevertheless, without explicit details about the data collection process, it cannot be definitively stated what methods were employed.
