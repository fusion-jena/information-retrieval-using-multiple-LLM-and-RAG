The text does not explicitly state the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, based on the information given about the accuracy and loss curves, it appears that the models were trained until they reached a minimum loss value or became stable. This suggests that one possible criterion used could be reaching a plateau in validation loss. Additionally, the mention of reducing the learning rate in the last 50,000 iterations implies that another potential criterion might be a predetermined number of iterations or epochs. Without further clarification from the original source, this is only speculation.
