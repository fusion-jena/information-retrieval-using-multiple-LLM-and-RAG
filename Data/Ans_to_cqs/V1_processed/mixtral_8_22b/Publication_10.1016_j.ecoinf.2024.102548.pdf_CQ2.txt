Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available from the given context to determine what specific data formats were used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the mentioned architectures such as InceptionResNetV2, ResNet-50, InceptionV3, and others, we can infer that the primary focus of these models is on image processing and computer vision tasks. Therefore, it would be reasonable to assume that the input data format used in their deep learning pipeline is likely images or visual data. Nevertheless, without explicit confirmation from the source material, this remains speculative.
