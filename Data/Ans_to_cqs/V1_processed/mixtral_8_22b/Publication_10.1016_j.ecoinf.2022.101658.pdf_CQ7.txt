The text does not explicitly state the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it mentions that manual classification of fuel types used in semantic segmentation training and testing were limited to data collected at the Pelican Mountain (PM) and Calling Lake (CL) field sites. Additionally, field measurement data and raw photos from the Conklin (CK) field site were used solely for independent validation. Based on this information, one could infer that the data from the PM and CL field sites might have been used for both training and testing the deep learning model, while the data from the CK field site was reserved exclusively for validation purposes. Nevertheless, without explicit confirmation or further details regarding the splitting process, this remains speculative.
