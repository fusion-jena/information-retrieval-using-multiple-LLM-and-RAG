In the given context, it is mentioned that a Phoenix receiver was utilized to determine sample locations in the middle of each square. Three five-cm-diameter cores of 15-cm length were taken at each location, which were then blended to obtain a representative sample of the soil at that site. This suggests that one method utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is through physical sampling of soil. Additionally, the context mentions the use of Landsat 8 OLI and TIRS bands of 30-m resolution and remote sensing image data from Google Earth Engine (GEE) for this study. This indicates that another method utilized for collecting raw data is through satellite imagery and remote sensing technology. However, there is no mention of any other specific methods such as surveys or public datasets being utilized in this particular study.
