The given context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is implied that the data used in the pipeline is related to satellite imagery, specifically from the Landsat 8 satellite. This suggests that the data format used could be raster or geospatial data, which is typically used for representing satellite images. Furthermore, the context mentions the use of various spectral bands (such as Blue, Green, Red, NIR, SWIR 1, and SWIR 2) in the analysis, indicating that the data might include multi-band raster files. It is also mentioned that unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images are utilized, suggesting that the data format could also include drone or aerial photography data. Therefore, while the exact data format is not specified, it can be inferred that the data used in the deep learning pipeline is likely in the form of raster or geospatial data, potentially including multi-band raster files and aerial photography data.
