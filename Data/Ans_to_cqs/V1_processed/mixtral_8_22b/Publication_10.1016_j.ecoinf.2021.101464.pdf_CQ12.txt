Based on the given information, it appears that the study uses a Random Forest (RF) model, not a deep learning model like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. The Random Forest model is a popular machine learning algorithm known for its high accuracy and robustness against overfitting. It operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of individual trees. However, if you need specific details about the use of deep learning models in this context, I would recommend consulting additional resources or reaching out to the authors of the study for clarification.
