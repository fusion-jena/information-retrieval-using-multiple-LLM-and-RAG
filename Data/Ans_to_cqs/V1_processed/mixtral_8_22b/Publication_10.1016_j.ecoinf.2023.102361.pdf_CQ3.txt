The text does not explicitly mention any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does suggest that one application of their approach could involve using a trained model to automatically annotate a larger set of unlabeled image data. This implies that some form of data annotation technique may have been employed during the initial labeling process, but the exact method remains unspecified within the given information.
