Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide a direct link to the specific deep learning pipeline used in this case. However, I can suggest some popular repositories where you might find similar pipelines or tools for optimizing hyperparameters using algorithms like TPEBO. Here are a few examples:

1. Hyperopt - A Python library for serial and parallel optimization over awkward search spaces, which includes implementations of various Bayesian Optimization strategies such as Tree Parzen Estimators (TPE), including TPEBO. You can find it here: <https://github.com/hyperopt/hyperopt>

2. Optuna - A hyperparameter optimization framework that supports many types of ML libraries, including PyTorch and TensorFlow. It provides a simple API to define and tune hyperparameters. Find it here: <https://github.com/optuna/optuna>

3. Keras Tuner - A high-level library for hyperparameter tuning of deep learning models built on top of Keras. It offers several tuners, including Random Search, Grid Search, and Bayesian Optimization. Check it out here: <https://keras.io/keras_tuner/>
