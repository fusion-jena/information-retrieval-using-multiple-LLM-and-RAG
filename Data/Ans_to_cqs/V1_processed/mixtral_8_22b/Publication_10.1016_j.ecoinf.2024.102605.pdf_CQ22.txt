The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using two main metrics: Overall Accuracy (OA) and Kappa Coefficient. In this case, the OA is 89.50%, which indicates how often the model predicts correctly out of all predictions made. On the other hand, the Kappa Coefficient measures the agreement between predicted and observed categories while accounting for chance agreements. Here, it has a value of 0.8666, indicating strong agreement between the model's predictions and the actual observations. Other common evaluation metrics such as Precision, Recall, or F1 Score were not mentioned in the given context.
