Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to determine which specific optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context. The text discusses a tree-based FIS (fuzzy inference system) called Apis-FIS, but it does not provide details about any deep learning pipelines or optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
