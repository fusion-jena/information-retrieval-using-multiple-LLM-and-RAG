The given context does not provide specific information about the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, or other methods. However, it mentions that the framework uses the BirdNET-Analyzer deep learning model for monitoring bird species based on their vocalizations. This suggests that some form of optimization technique was likely employed during the training phase of the BirdNET-Analyzer model, but the exact method remains unclear from the provided context.
