Unfortunately, there is no information available regarding the use of a deep learning model or its specific hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer in the given context. The text primarily discusses the optimization and performance evaluation of Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models. It mentions important indices like "Gain" and "Frequency" for measuring variable importance in XGBoost and "Percent IncMSE" and "IncNodePurity" for evaluating variable importance in RF. Additionally, key parameters for tuning XGBoost, including "nrounds," "max depth," "min child weight," "gamma," and "subsample," are mentioned. However, none of this information pertains directly to a deep learning model or its hyperparameters.
