Based on the given context, it does not provide information about addressing data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, some common techniques used to address data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets such that each subset maintains the same distribution of classes as the original dataset. Oversampling increases the size of minority class samples while undersampling reduces the size of majority class samples. Diverse data collection aims to collect more representative data from different sources to reduce bias.

These techniques help improve the accuracy and fairness of machine learning models by reducing overfitting, underfitting, and biased predictions caused by imbalanced datasets. However, it is important to note that no single technique can completely eliminate data bias, and multiple approaches may need to be combined to achieve optimal results.
