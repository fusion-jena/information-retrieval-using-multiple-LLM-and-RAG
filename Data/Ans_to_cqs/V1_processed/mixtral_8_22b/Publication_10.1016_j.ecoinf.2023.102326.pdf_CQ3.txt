The given context does not provide information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and landmark annotation. These techniques help label various types of objects or regions within images or videos, enabling models to learn patterns and relationships between them. The choice of technique depends on the specific task and dataset being used.

Based on the given context, we can infer that the study involves analyzing large datasets of urban acoustic environments using machine learning approaches such as sound event classification. While this doesn't directly relate to image or video analysis, similar principles apply when working with audio data. Annotations might involve identifying different sounds or events within recordings, allowing models to classify them accurately. Unfortunately, without further details regarding the specific methodology employed in this study, we cannot determine the exact data annotation techniques utilized.
