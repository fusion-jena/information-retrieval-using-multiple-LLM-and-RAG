To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, various techniques can be employed. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting is a method used to ensure that each subset of the dataset maintains the same distribution of classes as the original dataset. This helps prevent any particular class from being underrepresented or overrepresented in the subsets, thus reducing bias.

Oversampling is another technique used to balance datasets where one class has significantly fewer instances compared to other classes. In this case, synthetic examples are created from existing minority class instances to increase their representation in the dataset.

Undersampling, on the other hand, reduces the number of majority class instances to match the size of the minority class. This approach may lead to information loss since it removes some instances from the dataset. However, it can still help reduce bias when dealing with imbalanced datasets.

Lastly, collecting diverse data is crucial for ensuring that the trained model performs well across different populations and conditions. By gathering data from multiple sources and varying environmental factors, we can create a more robust and unbiased dataset.

These techniques play essential roles in mitigating data bias during preprocessing stages of the deep learning pipeline. They contribute towards building fair and accurate models capable of handling real-world complexities.
