The text does not provide explicit information about specific preprocessing steps used before training the deep learning model. However, it mentions that one of the advantages of using TensorFlow was eliminating the need for preprocessing images for the identification system. This suggests that the authors did not perform any extensive image preprocessing tasks such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning before feeding them into the TensorFlow model. Instead, they directly compared TensorFlow's classification performance based on cleaned and raw images for Mexican species. The only adjustments made to TensorFlow's settings were increasing the validation percentage from 10% to 16% due to limited available images for some species and exploring different numbers of training steps to optimize the tradeoff between computation time and classification efficiency.
