The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics such as overall accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Overall accuracy is calculated by dividing the number of images correctly classified by the total number of images. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made by the model. It is calculated by dividing the number of true positives by the sum of true positives and false positives. Recall measures the proportion of actual positives that were identified correctly by the model. It is calculated by dividing the number of true positives by the sum of true positives and false negatives. The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, which provides a single metric that balances both precision and recall. In addition to these metrics, frame rates (FPS) are also considered when evaluating the performance of the model on specific hardware platforms like the Jetson AGX Xavier or a computer equipped with an Nvidia GTX1080 GPU.
