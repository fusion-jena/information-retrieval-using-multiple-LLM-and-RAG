The given context does not explicitly mention the method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that the dataset used in this study was shared by Jiang et al. (2020) through a GitHub repository. This suggests that the researchers may have used publicly available datasets for their study. It is also possible that they collected data from various sources such as sensors or surveys, but these details are not specified in the provided context. Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot definitively state what methods were utilized for collecting raw data in this particular deep learning pipeline.
