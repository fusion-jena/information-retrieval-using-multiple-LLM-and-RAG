The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it can be inferred from general machine learning practices that these preprocessing techniques are often applied to improve the quality and efficiency of the training process. Normalization scales numeric columns to a range between 0 and 1, which helps prevent attributes with larger values from dominating those with smaller ones during the learning phase. Scaling adjusts the values of numeric features to have approximately mean=0 and variance=1, ensuring all features contribute equally to the final output. Cleaning involves handling missing values, outliers, and irrelevant information in the dataset. These preprocessing steps are essential for achieving better accuracy and reliability in forecasting results when applying deep learning approaches like LSTM, CNN, and ConvLSTM, as mentioned in the given context.
