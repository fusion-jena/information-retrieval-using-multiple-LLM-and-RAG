Based on the given context, it appears that no specific deep learning model was mentioned or utilized in this research. Instead, the study focuses on using the Temporal Information Partitioning Network (TIPNet) approach to create eco-hydrological process networks for a pine-dominated ecosystem in the Himalayas. The main objective of this approach is to identify the contributions of sub-daily scale (6 hours) variability in creating within-week variability by generating weekly process networks. Additionally, the study aims to recognize the dominant causal hydrometeorological variables influencing these processes. Therefore, the purpose of this research is not related to any deep learning models but rather to understand and analyze the complex relationships between different environmental factors affecting the studied ecosystem.
