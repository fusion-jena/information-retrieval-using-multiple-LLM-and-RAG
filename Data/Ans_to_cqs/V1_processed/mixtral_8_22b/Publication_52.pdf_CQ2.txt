The text mentions several types of data used in deep learning pipelines. For instance, Krizhevsky, Sutskever, & Hinton (2012) trained a large deep convolutional neural network to classify 1.2 million high-resolution images from the ImageNet LSVRC-2010 contest into 1000 different classes. This indicates that image data was used in this particular deep learning application. Furthermore, the paper by Giannakopoulos (2015) discusses the use of audio signals in deep learning models, specifically for audio signal analysis using Python libraries. Additionally, the authors mention the use of cellular simultaneous recurrent networks (CSRNs) for generating initial filters of CNNs for feature extraction and regularized extreme learning machines (RELMs) for classification. These techniques could potentially be applied to various types of data, including images, audio, or other forms of structured data such as CSV files. However, it should be noted that the specific type of data used would depend on the problem being addressed and the chosen deep learning architecture.
