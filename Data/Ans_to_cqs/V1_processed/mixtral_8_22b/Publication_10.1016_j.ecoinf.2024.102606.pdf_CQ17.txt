In the provided context, there are no explicit mentions of traditional regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, several strategies were employed to mitigate overfitting due to the limited amount of available data. These include data augmentation and cross-validation.

Data augmentation is a technique used to artificially expand the dataset by applying various transformations to the existing samples. In this case, the applied transformations included random cropping, mosaics, color distortions (such as brightness, contrast, saturation, hue), Gaussian blur, random scaling, random rotation, and random horizontal flipping. By exposing the model to these variations during training, it reduces the likelihood of overfitting and encourages the model to generalize better.

Cross-validation was another method utilized to address potential overfitting issues. Cross-validation involves splitting the dataset into multiple subsets, where each subset serves as a separate testing set once. For each split, a new model is trained, allowing for the creation of multiple models based on different portions of the dataset. After evaluating all the models, their performances are averaged to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the model's capabilities on the dataset. This approach helps ensure that the model performs well across a wide variety of inputs, including degraded images from older microscope slides.
