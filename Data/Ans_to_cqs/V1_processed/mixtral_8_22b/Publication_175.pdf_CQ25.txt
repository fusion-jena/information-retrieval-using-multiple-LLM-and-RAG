The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the given context is image classification. The text specifically mentions using ResNet 100, a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is known for its ability to both extract features from images and classify these images based on those features. The goal of feeding a large dataset of labeled images into this CNN is to allow it to adjust its internal parameters and minimize classification errors through a process called back-propagation. Ultimately, the aim is to create an accurate image classification model capable of distinguishing between different classes or categories within the dataset.
