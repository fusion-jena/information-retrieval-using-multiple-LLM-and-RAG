The given context does not provide specific information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, common techniques used to mitigate data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on certain characteristics or labels, ensuring that these subgroups are proportionally represented in both the training and testing datasets. This helps maintain the balance between different classes or categories within the dataset.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to handle class imbalance in datasets. Oversampling increases the number of instances in the minority class by duplicating existing samples or generating synthetic ones, while undersampling reduces the number of instances in the majority class by randomly removing some samples. Both methods aim to achieve a more balanced distribution of classes in the dataset.

Diverse data collection focuses on gathering data from various sources, demographics, or environments to ensure that the dataset represents a wide range of scenarios and conditions. This can help reduce biases introduced by relying solely on data from limited sources or populations.

While the given context does not explicitly mention any of these techniques, they are commonly employed to tackle data bias during preprocessing in deep learning pipelines.
