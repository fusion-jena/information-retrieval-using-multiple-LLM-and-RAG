The given context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that images are used as the primary data format since the study focuses on coral reef substrate mapping using underwater drone imagery. Furthermore, various deep learning models such as AlexNet, ResNet-50, VGG-19, GoogleNet, and Inceptionv3 are employed for feature extraction, indicating that the data format is indeed compatible with these popular image classification architectures. Therefore, we can conclude that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is primarily images.
