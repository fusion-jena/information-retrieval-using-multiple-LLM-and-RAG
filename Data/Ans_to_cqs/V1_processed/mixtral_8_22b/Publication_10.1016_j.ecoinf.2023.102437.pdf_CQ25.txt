The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, considering the references cited, it appears that the deep learning model might be used for forecasting or prediction purposes. Specifically, the paper by Ham, Y.-G., Kim, J.-H., Luo, J.-J. (2019) discusses using deep learning for multi-year ENSO (El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation) forecasts. Additionally, the reference to Hastie, T., Tibshirani, R., Friedman, J.H., Friedman, J.H. (2009) suggests that the deep learning model could also be employed for statistical learning, data mining, inference, and prediction. Therefore, without further specific details about the deep learning model discussed in the context, one can only infer that its purpose may involve forecasting, prediction, or other related applications.
