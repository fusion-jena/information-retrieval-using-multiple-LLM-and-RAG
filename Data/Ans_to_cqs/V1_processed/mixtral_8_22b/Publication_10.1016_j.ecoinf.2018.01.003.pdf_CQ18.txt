The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it discusses the use of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) models for Ecological Footprint (EF) calculations. Typically, when working with these types of models, strategies such as cross-validation or monitoring metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score are employed to evaluate their performance during training. Cross-validation involves splitting the data into multiple folds and iteratively fitting the model on different subsets while evaluating its performance on the remaining subset. This helps prevent overfitting and provides a better understanding of how well the model might perform on unseen data. Monitoring metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score help assess the model's effectiveness in making correct predictions and handling false positives/negatives. Without further information from the given context, one cannot definitively state the exact strategy used to monitor the model performance during training.
