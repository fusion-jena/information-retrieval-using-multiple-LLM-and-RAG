The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using a validation loss metric. The learning rate is automatically reduced by a factor of 0.1 when the validation loss has not improved for 15 consecutive epochs. This approach helps ensure that the model does not get stuck in local minima or overfit the training data. Additionally, weight decay is applied to control the strength of the unit Gaussian prior, which further prevents overfitting. These strategies help maintain the balance between underfitting and overfitting, ensuring optimal model performance.
