The given context does not provide information about which specific frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch were used to build the deep learning models mentioned. However, it mentions that deep learning techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and transfer learning techniques were utilized for LULC classification. It also states that these techniques can be integrated with the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform through the Google Cloud platform for dynamic LULC mapping using satellite imagery and real-time observations.
