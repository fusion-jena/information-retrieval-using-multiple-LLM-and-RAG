Before training a deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), several preprocessing steps may be applied to the input data. These steps aim to enhance the quality of the data and improve the overall performance of the model. Some common preprocessing techniques include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization involves adjusting the range of pixel intensity values in images or spectrograms to a specific range, often between 0 and 1. Scaling refers to resizing the input data to fit the required dimensions of the neural network architecture. Cleaning involves removing noise or irrelevant information from the input data to prevent it from negatively impacting the model's performance. In this case, the authors mention applying different normalization strategies to spectrograms before feeding them into the CNN. They also discuss using multiple input channels in the CNN, which allows for the use of various preprocessing techniques simultaneously.
