Based on the given context, it appears that TensorFlow was used to build the deep learning model. This is mentioned in the reference section where Abadi et al. (2016) discuss TensorFlow as a system for large-scale machine learning. However, there is no explicit mention of other frameworks such as PyTorch being used. Therefore, we can only confirm that TensorFlow was used to build the deep learning model based on the information provided.
