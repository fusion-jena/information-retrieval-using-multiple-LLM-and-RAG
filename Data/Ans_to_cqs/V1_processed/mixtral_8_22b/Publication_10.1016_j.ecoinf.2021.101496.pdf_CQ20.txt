Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of which hardware resources were used for training the deep learning model. However, we can infer from Table 1 that the Raspberry Pi 3B+ was used for developing the Rasp2SPAD prototype. This device has an ARM Broadcom Quad-Core BCM2837B0 processor running at 1.4 GHz and 1GB of RAM. It does not have any dedicated GPU or TPU for accelerating machine learning tasks. Therefore, it can be assumed that the deep learning model was trained using this CPU and RAM configuration.
