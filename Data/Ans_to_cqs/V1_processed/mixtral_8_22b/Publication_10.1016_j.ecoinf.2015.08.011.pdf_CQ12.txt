Based on the given context, the deep learning model used in the pipeline is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). However, there isn't enough information to specify whether it is a specific type of ANN like a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer. Therefore, based on the available context, the type of deep learning model used can only be identified as an ANN.
