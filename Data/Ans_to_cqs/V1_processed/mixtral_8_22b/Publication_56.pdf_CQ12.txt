The text does not explicitly state what specific type of deep learning model was used in the pipeline. However, it mentions several types of deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP). It also references papers that discuss these models in detail. For instance, reference [38] discusses the use of CNNs for identifying classes, while reference [37] proposes a LRP for LSTM networks. Therefore, without further information, we cannot definitively determine the exact type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
