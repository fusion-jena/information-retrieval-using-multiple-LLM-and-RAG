The information provided does not explicitly mention where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it mentions that the data is stored on Google Drive in CSV format for further analysis. It also refers to an official documentation link (https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/bedc59f37c9545c981a839eb552e4084) which might contain more details about the data repository. Unfortunately, without additional context or direct reference to a specific data repository like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF, I cannot provide a definitive answer.
