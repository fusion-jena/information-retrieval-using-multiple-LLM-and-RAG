Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, I can share some common practices used in machine learning and deep learning projects to manage randomness:

1. Fixed Random Seeds: One common strategy is to set a fixed random seed value before running any code involving random processes. This ensures reproducibility, as the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers will be generated every time the code runs.

2. Cross-Validation: To reduce the impact of random initialization of weights and biases in neural networks, k-fold cross-validation can be used. This involves splitting the dataset into 'k' subsets, training the model 'k' times, and validating it on one subset while training on the remaining ones. The average performance across all folds provides a more robust estimate of the model's generalization ability.

3. Multiple Runs: Running the entire experiment multiple times with different random seeds and averaging the results can help mitigate the effects of randomness. This approach is particularly useful when evaluating the performance of models trained with stochastic optimization algorithms like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).

4. Deterministic Algorithms: Some libraries offer deterministic versions of certain operations, such as sorting or sampling, which can help eliminate sources of non-determinism in the pipeline. For example, TensorFlow provides functions like tf.set_random_seed() and tf.reset_default_graph().

5. Reproducible Experiments: Documenting all aspects of the experimental setup, including software versions, hardware specifications, and hyperparameters, helps ensure reproducibility. Tools like Docker containers or virtual environments can also aid in creating consistent runtime environments.
