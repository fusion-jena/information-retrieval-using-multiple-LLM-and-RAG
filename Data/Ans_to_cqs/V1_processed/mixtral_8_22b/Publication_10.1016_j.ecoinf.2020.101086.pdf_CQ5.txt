Based on the provided context, it appears that the study involves Species Distribution Models (SDMs) rather than traditional deep learning pipelines such as those used for image classification tasks like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Therefore, the datasets used in this case would likely be related to ecological or biological data, specifically focusing on species occurrences within their respective environments.

In the context provided, there is mention of a dataset limitation due to the scarcity of certain species or insufficient numbers of species records. Additionally, the authors discuss generating simulated datasets during the course of their research. However, specific names or types of these datasets are not mentioned.

To summarize, unlike typical deep learning applications involving well-known datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, this study focuses on Species Distribution Models and uses ecologically relevant datasets. Unfortunately, without further information, I cannot provide more precise details about the exact nature or names of these datasets.
