The text does not provide explicit information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, it mentions that the best performing model based on the validation loss was saved after the training process. This suggests that the model might have been serialized for later use. Unfortunately, there is no mention of any specific platform or method used for the actual deployment of this saved model.
