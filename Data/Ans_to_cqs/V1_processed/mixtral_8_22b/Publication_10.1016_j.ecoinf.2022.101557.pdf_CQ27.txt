Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to provide a detailed answer about how the trained deep learning model was deployed. However, based on common practices in machine learning projects, after training the model, it might have been serialized and saved in a format like.h5 or.pkl. Then, it could have been loaded onto a platform suitable for its intended application, such as a web server or cloud service, to serve predictions. But without specific details, I cannot confirm these steps were taken in this case.
