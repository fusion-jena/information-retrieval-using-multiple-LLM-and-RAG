The authors used manual annotation techniques to label their training data. Specifically, they used the program RectLabel to draw bounding boxes around individual trees in their training images. They enforced a minimum size threshold for tree annotations by comparing the hand-annotations to a LiDAR canopy height model and removing any trees less than 3 meters in height. Additionally, they did not attempt to delineate understory trees that were not visible in the RGB imagery. This suggests that the authors primarily used bounding box annotation techniques to label their training data. However, it is worth noting that the authors acknowledge some uncertainty in the bounding box extents due to the use of remotely sensed imagery alone.
