The code repository of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, there is a reference to a GitHub repository (<https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet>) which might contain relevant information about the deep learning pipeline used in the study. It should be noted that without further clarification, it cannot be confirmed if this specific repository contains the exact code used in the research.

Based on the context provided, the authors have made modifications to some model parameters and followed guidelines from the developers of darknet, a popular open-source neural network framework. This suggests that they may have utilized existing tools and libraries rather than developing their own custom deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it would be reasonable to assume that the code used in the study could potentially be found in the referenced GitHub repository or similar repositories containing implementations of deep learning models using darknet.
