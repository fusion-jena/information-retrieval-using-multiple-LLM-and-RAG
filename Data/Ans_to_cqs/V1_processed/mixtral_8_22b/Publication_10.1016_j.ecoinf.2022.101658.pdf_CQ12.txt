The study utilizes a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) as part of its pipeline. Specifically, it employs the convolution layers of the Deeplabv3-Resnet101 network as a learned feature extractor. A classification head of 2048 neurons with sigmoid activation is attached to this network. Each pixel is assigned ten scores between 0 and 1 for the ten classes, and the class with the highest score is designated as the predicted class for that pixel. The cross-entropy loss serves as the objective function for training the network, while the Adam optimizer updates the trainable parameters.
