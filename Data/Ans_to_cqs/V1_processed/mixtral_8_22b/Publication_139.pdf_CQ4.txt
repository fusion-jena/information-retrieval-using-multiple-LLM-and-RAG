The given text does not provide explicit information about the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on common practices in deep learning pipelines, some possible data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, zooming, brightness adjustment, contrast adjustment, saturation adjustment, and hue adjustment. These techniques can help improve the robustness and generalization ability of the models by increasing the diversity of the training data. It should be noted that the choice of data augmentation techniques depends on the nature of the problem and the characteristics of the input data. Therefore, without further details about the specific deep learning pipeline mentioned in the text, we cannot determine which data augmentation techniques were applied.
