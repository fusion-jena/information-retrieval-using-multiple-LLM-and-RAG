The authors do not explicitly mention any specific techniques such as cross-validation, stratified splitting, or diverse datasets used to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning models. However, they discuss pre-training each network using its corresponding leaf data during the validation phase and combining both softmax outputs to compute final class scores using fusion methods like average or max voting. They also highlight the importance of having large amounts of training data for deep CNN networks, pointing out that the biggest plant database they found, the PlantClef2015 dataset, had only around 113,205 images, which is significantly smaller compared to existing general major datasets for images, videos, or languages. Additionally, they note that the PlantClef2015 dataset has one of the largest numbers of object categories but the smallest number of images, making it challenging to match the scale and variety of existing datasets. These observations suggest that the authors might have considered the diversity and size of the dataset when developing their deep learning models, although no explicit details about these considerations are mentioned in the given context.
