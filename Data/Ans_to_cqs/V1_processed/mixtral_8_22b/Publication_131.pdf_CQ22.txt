To evaluate the performance of the first deep learning model, the authors use the metric of overall accuracy. They report a score of 96.34% for training and 97.53% for testing data. Additionally, they provide a confusion matrix for the test data, which shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions made by the model for each class. This allows them to see how well the model performs on individual classes and identify any potential biases or weaknesses in its classification abilities. However, it should be noted that other common evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are not mentioned in the given context.
