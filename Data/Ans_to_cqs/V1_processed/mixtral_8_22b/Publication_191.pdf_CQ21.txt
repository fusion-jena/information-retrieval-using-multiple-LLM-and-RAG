The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, some clues can be derived from the mentioned details.

For instance, the authors use the fixed learning policy during the training phase of their deconvolutional network. They also mention computing the top-1 classification accuracy, which suggests they might calculate metrics such as precision, recall, or F1 score to evaluate the performance of their model.

Additionally, the authors discuss visualizing the response of filter units in different layers, indicating that they may generate saliency maps or heatmaps to understand how the model makes its predictions.

Lastly, although not explicitly stated, creating confusion matrices could help them analyze misclassifications and identify areas for improvement in their model.

Therefore, while the exact postprocessing steps are not specified, one can infer that calculating evaluation metrics, generating visualizations like saliency maps, and possibly constructing confusion matrices are likely part of the process.
