Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the study utilized a hyperparameter tuning methodology using grid search to find the optimal values of various hyperparameters. This suggests that multiple hyperparameters were considered, but their exact names or values are not mentioned. Commonly used hyperparameters in deep learning include learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, optimizer type, and regularization parameters like weight decay or dropout rate. Without more detailed information from the original source, we cannot determine the exact hyperparameters used in this particular study.
