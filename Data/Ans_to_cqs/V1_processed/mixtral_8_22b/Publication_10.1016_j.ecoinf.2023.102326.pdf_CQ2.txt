The text does not explicitly state the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the data format used is audio since the study focuses on analyzing large-scale audio data. Specifically, the researchers calculated Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) for all recordings in their dataset, sorted the values into 1024 equally sized bins, and averaged the values energetically inside each bin. They also focused on the frequency range from 0 to 13 kHz, as frequencies above 13 kHz are rarely occupied in the urban Acoustic Environment (AE). Therefore, it can be concluded that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is audio.
