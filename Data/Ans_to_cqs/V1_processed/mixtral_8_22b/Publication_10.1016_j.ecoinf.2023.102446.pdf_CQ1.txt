Based on the given context, it appears that the authors used data from a flux tower to collect their raw data. Flux towers are typically equipped with various sensors that measure different environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and CO2 concentrations. These measurements can be taken at high frequencies, allowing researchers to capture detailed information about the environment over time. In this case, the authors specifically mention using half-hour temporal resolution flux tower data for all variables used in their study. This suggests that they collected data from the flux tower every 30 minutes, which would provide them with a large amount of data to work with. It is also worth noting that the authors mention working with Dr. Sandipan Mukherjee and the competent authorities of G.B. Pant National Institute of Himalayan Environment, Almora, Uttarakhand, India, who may have been involved in setting up or maintaining the flux tower used in this study. Overall, while the specific details of how the raw data was collected are not explicitly stated in the given context, it seems clear that the authors relied heavily on sensor data from a flux tower to gather the necessary information for their research.
