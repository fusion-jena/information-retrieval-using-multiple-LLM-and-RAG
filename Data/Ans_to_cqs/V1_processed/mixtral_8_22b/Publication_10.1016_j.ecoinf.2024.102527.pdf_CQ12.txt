In this study, the authors use a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) model called ResNext-101. This model belongs to the ResNeXt family of models, which combine the advantages of both the ResNet and InceptionV3 models. These types of models are commonly used for empty camera trap image recognition tasks. The specific version of the model used here is ResNext-101, which has a structure very similar to the popular ResNet series models. The authors suggest that their findings regarding the performance of ResNext-101 can also apply to other models within the ResNet family.
