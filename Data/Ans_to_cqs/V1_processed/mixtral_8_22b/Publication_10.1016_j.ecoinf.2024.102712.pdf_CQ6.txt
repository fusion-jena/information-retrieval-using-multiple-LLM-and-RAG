The given context does not provide explicit details about the specific preprocessing steps used before training a deep learning model. However, it mentions a simple atmospheric correction using the Dark Object Subtraction 1 (DOS1) method, which can be considered as one of the preprocessing steps. In general, common preprocessing steps before training a deep learning model include normalization, scaling, cleaning, augmenting, encoding categorical variables, handling missing values, and feature selection. Normalization scales numeric columns to a range between 0 and 1, while standardization rescales features so that they have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. Data cleaning involves removing noise and inconsistencies from the dataset. Augmentation techniques like rotation, zooming, flipping, etc., help increase the size of the dataset. Encoding categorical variables converts non-numeric categories into numerical form. Handling missing values may involve either deletion or imputation methods. Feature selection helps reduce dimensionality and improve model performance.
