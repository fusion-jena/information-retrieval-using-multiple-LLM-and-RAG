Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available from the given context to determine which specific framework was used to build the deep learning model. The text does mention using the TPEBO algorithm for hyperparameter optimization, and it discusses the use of LSTM neural networks, but it doesn't provide any details about the underlying framework or library employed to construct these components. Therefore, I cannot definitively state whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or another framework was utilized.
