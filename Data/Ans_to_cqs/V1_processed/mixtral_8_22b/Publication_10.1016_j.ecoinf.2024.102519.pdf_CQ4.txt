The given context does not provide information about the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, some common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, and adding noise. These techniques help increase the amount of training data available and improve the generalization performance of a deep learning model by introducing variations into the input data.

Based on the context, it can be inferred that X. Wu et al. conducted research using AI methods such as traditional linear programming, nonlinear programming, dynamic programming, modern genetic algorithms (GA), particle swarm optimization algorithms, and deep learning. They also mentioned that these methods have been successful in both theoretical and practical applications. However, there is no mention of any specific data augmentation techniques used in their study or the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query based solely on the given context.
