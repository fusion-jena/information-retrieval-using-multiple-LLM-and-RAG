Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no explicit information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into sets such as train, test, and validation. However, it can be generally assumed that common practices in machine learning and deep learning have been followed. These typically involve splitting the dataset into three subsets: training set, validation set, and testing set.

The training set is used to fit the parameters of the model, while the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting during the training process. Lastly, the testing set is used to evaluate the final performance of the trained model. Common ratios for this split include 60-20-20%, 70-15-15%, or 80-10-10% for the training, validation, and testing sets respectively.

In summary, without further details regarding the specific criteria used in this case, we can assume that standard practices for splitting datasets in machine learning and deep learning applications have likely been applied.
