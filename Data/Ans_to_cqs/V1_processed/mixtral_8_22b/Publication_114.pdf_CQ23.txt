Based on the given information, there isn't any explicit mention of specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, some aspects mentioned could contribute to the robustness and applicability of the model. For instance, the methodology allows for the processing of large datasets, suggesting that the model might have been trained on a diverse set of data. Additionally, the authors note that their approach has the potential for transfer to other forest regions due to on-the-fly data acquisition and processing capabilities. This implies that the model may have been designed with adaptability in mind, although no concrete validation techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting are explicitly stated.
