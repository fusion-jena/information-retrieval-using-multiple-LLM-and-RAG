The given context does mention one hyperparameter, specifically for adjusting the balance relationship between the nonlinear factors of the activation function and the identity mapping of A'(x), which is denoted as λ. This hyperparameter is calculated using the formula λ = e^(E/e), where 'e' represents the current number of rounds of training and 'E' represents the total number of rounds of model training. As the value of 'e' approaches 'E', the value of λ tends towards 1, causing A'(x) to approach x. This indicates that nonlinear factors are gradually integrated into the generalized model. However, it should be noted that the context does not provide information about other common hyperparameters like learning rate or optimizers.
