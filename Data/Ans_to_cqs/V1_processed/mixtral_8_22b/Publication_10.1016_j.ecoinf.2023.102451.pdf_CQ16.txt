Based on the provided context, it appears that the proposed model, EMViT-Net, is trained for 100 epochs using the optimizer AdamW and the activation function GELU. However, there is no explicit mention of the criteria used to determine when training is complete. Typically, common criteria used to determine when training is complete include reaching a certain number of epochs, achieving a desired level of performance on a validation set, or observing a plateau in the validation loss. In this case, since the model is trained for a fixed number of epochs (100), it seems likely that this criterion was used to determine when training was complete. Additionally, the use of a validation set during training suggests that performance on this set could have been monitored to inform decisions about when to stop training. However, without further information, it is not possible to definitively say what criteria were used to determine when training was complete for this particular model.
