The context does not provide specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the study uses a multifrequency acoustics dataset acquired from scientific echosounders in the West African waters. It also refers to the use of a towed multiparameter system to represent environmental conditions at a fine scale. Additionally, the text discusses the application of Fisheries acoustics techniques, which facilitate the collection of high-resolution spatial and temporal data concerning marine organisms without causing any disturbance. In summary, based on the given context, the methods utilized for collecting raw data include scientific echosounders, towed multiparameter systems, and Fisheries acoustics techniques.
