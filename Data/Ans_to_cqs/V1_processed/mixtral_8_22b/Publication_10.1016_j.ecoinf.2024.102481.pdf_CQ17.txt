Regularization methods are techniques used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, resulting in poor generalization performance on new, unseen data. Two common regularization methods are dropout and L2 regularization. Dropout involves randomly setting a fraction of input or hidden units to zero during training, which helps reduce co-dependencies between neurons and encourages more robust features. On the other hand, L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, discouraging large weights and promoting smaller, simpler models. Both methods help control complexity and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.
