To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. These methods help ensure that the model generalizes well and does not favor any particular class or feature. Some commonly used techniques are:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes in both subsets. This ensures that the model learns from a representative sample of each class.

2. Oversampling: When dealing with imbalanced datasets, where some classes have significantly fewer samples compared to others, oversampling can be applied. This technique duplicates examples from the minority class until it reaches a more balanced ratio with the majority class.

3. Undersampling: Alternatively, undersampling can also be used to handle imbalanced datasets. Instead of increasing the number of minority class instances, this approach reduces the size of the majority class by randomly removing samples. However, care must be taken to avoid losing valuable information.

4. Diverse data collection: Collecting diverse data helps reduce bias in the dataset. By gathering data from various sources, demographics, and environments, the model becomes more robust and capable of handling different scenarios.

These techniques can be combined or used individually depending on the specific requirements and characteristics of the dataset.
