The text provides several methods used for collecting raw data in the field of marine species occurrences, which could potentially be applied in a deep learning pipeline. These methods include citizen science surveys, social media, diving centers, fishing events, and questionnaires. Citizen science involves the participation of members of the general public in scientific research, often contributing to data collection, analysis, and monitoring. Scuba divers, in particular, play a significant role in marine citizen science initiatives due to their ability to gather extensive data over long periods.

In addition to these sources, the text mentions the use of joint research efforts and improved scientific data sharing to collect and analyze a large amount of solid information on species occurrences. This suggests that collaboration among researchers and institutions is another valuable method for obtaining relevant data.

Moreover, the references to specific studies indicate that there may be publicly available datasets related to marine species occurrences. For instance, Ballard et al. (2017) discuss contributions to conservation outcomes by natural history museum-led citizen science, while Broennimann et al. (2012) describe measuring ecological niche overlap from occurrence and spatial environmental data. However, it should be noted that the text does not explicitly mention the use of sensors or other types of hardware for data collection.

In summary, the primary methods mentioned for collecting raw data in this context are citizen science surveys, social media, diving centers, fishing events, questionnaires, joint research efforts, and scientific data sharing. Publicly available datasets and potential collaborations with researchers and institutions may also provide valuable data sources.
