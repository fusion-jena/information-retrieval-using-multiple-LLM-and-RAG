The query asks about regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. Regularization is a technique used to prevent models from becoming too complex and overfitting the training data. Two common regularization techniques mentioned in the given context are dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a regularization method where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent overfitting by making the model more robust to small changes in the input data. Dropout works by setting a certain percentage of inputs to zero during each iteration of training, effectively reducing the capacity of the network and preventing co-dependencies between neurons.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. This encourages smaller weights and prevents any single feature from having too much influence on the output. By adding this penalty term, L2 regularization can help reduce overfitting and improve generalization performance.

Other regularization methods not explicitly mentioned in the given context include L1 regularization, early stopping, and batch normalization. L1 regularization adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute value of the weights, encouraging sparse solutions. Early stopping stops training once validation error starts increasing, while batch normalization standardizes activations across batches to improve stability and convergence speed.

Overall, regularization plays a crucial role in preventing overfitting and improving generalization performance in deep learning pipelines. The choice of regularization method depends on factors such as dataset size, complexity, and desired tradeoff between bias and variance.
