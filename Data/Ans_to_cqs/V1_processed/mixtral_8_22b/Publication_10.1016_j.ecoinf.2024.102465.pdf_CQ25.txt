The purpose of the deep learning model used in this research is primarily for semantic segmentation. Semantic segmentation involves assigning each pixel in an image to a specific class or category, allowing for a detailed understanding of the image content. In this case, the researchers employed the HRNet model, which is known for its high accuracy and stability in performing semantic segmentation tasks. The HRNet model achieves this by simultaneously merging high-resolution and low-resolution convolution computations.

In the context of this study, the HRNet model was used to process social media image data in PyCharm software for semantic segmentation. This enabled the derivation of various indices such as greenness, blueness, and sky openness, which are essential indicators of urban vitality. These indices were calculated using formulas described by Wu et al. (2023). For instance, the level of greenery in a panoramic image (G) was determined by calculating the total number and amount of pixels corresponding to vegetative and green spaces identified in the semantic segmentation process (PGreenness) over the overall number of pixels specified in the image (PTotal). Similarly, the level of openness in the panoramic image (O) was determined by calculating the percentage of identified sky elements (PSky).

Therefore, the primary purpose of the deep learning model in this research is to facilitate the accurate and efficient extraction of relevant information from images, thereby enabling a comprehensive assessment of urban vitality.
