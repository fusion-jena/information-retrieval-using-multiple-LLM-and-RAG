The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is to automate the process of fish grading or determining the level of freshness of various fish species. This is achieved by applying machine learning techniques to a dataset containing six organoleptic parameters collected from seven different fish species over eleven days. These parameters serve as the basis for automatically classifying the freshness levels of the fish. The specific type of deep learning task being performed here appears to be classification, as the goal is to assign each instance in the dataset to one of several predefined categories or classes representing varying degrees of freshness. However, it should be noted that while the text does mention the use of deep learning, it primarily focuses on describing the application of clustering methods for automatic freshness classification. Therefore, further clarification would be needed to definitively state whether the deep learning model specifically performs the classification task or if traditional machine learning algorithms are also involved in this process.
