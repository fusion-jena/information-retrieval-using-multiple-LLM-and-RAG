Unfortunately, there isn't enough context provided to accurately determine the specific process used to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, generally speaking, after training a deep learning model, it can be deployed through several steps such as model serialization, platform selection, and integration into existing systems or applications. Model serialization involves converting the trained model into a format that can be saved and loaded later, often as a binary file. The choice of platform depends on various factors like computational resources, scalability requirements, and ease of integration. Once these decisions have been made, the serialized model can then be integrated into existing systems or applications for real-world usage.
