The text does not provide explicit information about specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning applied to the data before feeding it into the deep learning model. However, it mentions that there is a pre-processing block in the model architecture that transforms the original input spectrogram before passing it through a series of residual stacks. It can be assumed that some form of preprocessing might have been performed within this pre-processing block, but without further details, it cannot be determined what exactly these preprocessing steps entail.
