The given context does not provide specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, I can share some common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. These include:

1. Bounding Box Annotation: This technique involves drawing a box around the object of interest in an image or video frame. It is commonly used in object detection tasks.

2. Semantic Segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image with its corresponding class. It is useful for identifying objects at a pixel level.

3. Instance Segmentation: Similar to semantic segmentation, but this technique differentiates between instances of the same class. For example, if there are multiple cars in an image, instance segmentation would identify each car individually.

4. Polygon Annotation: This technique involves drawing polygons around objects of interest. It is more precise than bounding boxes and is often used for irregularly shaped objects.

5. Landmark Annotation: This technique involves placing dots or points on key features of an object. It is often used in facial recognition tasks.

6. Line Annotation: This technique involves drawing lines to mark lanes, roads, boundaries, etc. It is often used in autonomous driving applications.
