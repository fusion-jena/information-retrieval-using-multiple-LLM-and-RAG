The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in this context is not explicitly stated. However, based on the information provided about the components of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), we can infer that the deep learning model might be used for image processing tasks such as classification, segmentation, or object detection. Specifically, the mention of using combinations of convolution layers, activation functions, and pooling for feature extraction suggests that the model could be employed for identifying patterns or objects within complex datasets like images or sounds. Additionally, the reference to the fully connected layer and the SoftMax activation function indicates that the model may also be utilized for making predictions or classifying inputs based on the extracted features.
