The text does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of AI and machine learning models to automate tasks such as detecting and classifying wildlife in images. This suggests that object detection and classification techniques are employed. Object detection involves identifying objects within an image and drawing bounding boxes around them, while classification assigns labels to each detected object. Instance segmentation, another technique mentioned indirectly through its purpose, goes beyond object detection by outlining the exact pixels belonging to each individual object. Although the text doesn't specify which techniques were used, it implies that bounding box annotation, object detection, classification, and possibly instance segmentation could be part of the deep learning pipeline for processing wildlife camera trap images.
