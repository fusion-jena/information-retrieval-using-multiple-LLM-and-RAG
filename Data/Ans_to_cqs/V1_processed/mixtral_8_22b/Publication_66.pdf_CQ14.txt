According to the given context, a random hyperparameter search was conducted to determine the optimum model structure. The number of layers and hidden nodes per layer were varied, with the number of layers ranging from one to four and the number of hidden nodes ranging from 20 to 1,000. The hyperparameter search was allowed to run until the top ten models had been identified. This suggests that a form of random search was employed to optimize the hyperparameters of the model. However, it is not explicitly stated whether this was a purely random search or if any other optimization techniques were utilized.
