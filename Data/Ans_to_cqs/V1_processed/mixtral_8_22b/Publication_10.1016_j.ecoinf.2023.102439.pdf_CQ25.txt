In the given context, the purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the model is being used for predictive purposes. Specifically, the model appears to be utilized for estimating vegetation biomass density for the year 2030. This is evident from the statement, "In this study, the NARX feedback ANN model was utilised to define vegetation biomass density for 2030." Additionally, the model seems to incorporate multiple variables such as LST, temperature, and precipitation parameters, which further supports its predictive nature. Therefore, it can be concluded that the primary purpose of the deep learning model in this context is to make predictions about future scenarios, specifically regarding vegetation biomass density.
