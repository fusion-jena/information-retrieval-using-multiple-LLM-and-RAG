To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, various techniques are employed. One such technique mentioned in the given context is the creation of balanced datasets. Neural networks often struggle with unbalanced datasets, which can lead to biased results. To overcome this issue, especially in the case of 'central-pixel labeling' architectures, balanced datasets can be created by carefully selecting the initial pixels used for learning. However, in the case of'semantic labeling', controlling the number of pixels per class becomes more challenging due to the composition of the images. Despite trying several methods, no significant difference in performance was observed. Therefore, the reported experiments utilized the median frequency balancing method.

Additionally, the context mentions that the dataset was split into three mutually exclusive parts: a learning set, a validation set, and a test set completely independent of the first two. This approach ensures that the model does not see any part of the testing data during training, reducing the risk of overfitting and improving the generalization capabilities of the model. While specific techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection are not explicitly mentioned in the context, these could also potentially be applied depending on the nature and distribution of the data.

Therefore, based on the given context, the main technique used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline is creating balanced datasets, particularly through careful initial pixel selection for 'central-pixel labeling' architectures and employing the median frequency balancing method. Furthermore, the dataset was partitioned into distinct learning, validation, and test sets to prevent overfitting and enhance model generalizability.
