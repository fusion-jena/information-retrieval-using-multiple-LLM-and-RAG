The provided context does not directly address the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it mentions that a correlation analysis was conducted on the variables before implementing the model to improve its predictive performance and reduce the risk of overfitting. This can be considered a form of feature selection or engineering, which is often part of the preprocessing stage in machine learning and deep learning pipelines. In general, common preprocessing steps for deep learning include data cleaning (removing missing or irrelevant data), normalization (scaling numerical input features to a standard range), and encoding categorical variables into numerical format if necessary. These steps help ensure optimal model performance and prevent issues like overfitting or poor convergence during training.
