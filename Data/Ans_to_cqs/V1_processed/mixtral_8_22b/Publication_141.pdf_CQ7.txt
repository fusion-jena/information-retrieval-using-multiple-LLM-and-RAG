The text does not provide explicit information about how the data was split into training, testing, and validation sets. However, we can infer some details from the given context. For instance, there are percentages listed for accuracy, which could represent either training or validation accuracy. Additionally, there are numbers indicating misclassified images, possibly representing errors made during the validation or testing phases.

In general, when working with machine learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), data is typically divided into three main categories: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to fit the parameters of the model, while the validation set helps tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Finally, the testing set evaluates the final performance of the model.

Although the exact methodology used to divide the data isn't specified here, common practices include splitting the data into 60-80% for training, 10-20% for validation, and 10-20% for testing. Alternatively, k-fold cross-validation may have been employed, where the data is partitioned into 'k' equal parts, and each subset serves as the validation set once, while the remaining 'k-1' subsets form the training set.
