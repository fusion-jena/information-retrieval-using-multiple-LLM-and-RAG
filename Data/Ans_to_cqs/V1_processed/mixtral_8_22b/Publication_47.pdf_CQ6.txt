The text does not provide explicit information about specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it mentions that they derived features from digitally available occurrence records, including geographic, climatic, biome, and anthropogenic factors. This suggests that some form of feature extraction or engineering took place prior to training the model. Additionally, there is mention of spatial cleaning, which could indicate that the authors removed or corrected any erroneous or inconsistent location data within their dataset.
