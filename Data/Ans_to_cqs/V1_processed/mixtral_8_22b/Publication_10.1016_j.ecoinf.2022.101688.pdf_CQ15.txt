In the given context, the optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline is mentioned as the Adam optimizer. The Adam optimizer is a popular choice for training deep learning models due to its ability to adaptively adjust the learning rate based on the first and second moments of the gradients. It combines the advantages of both Adaptive Gradient Algorithm (AdaGrad) and Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp) algorithms. The Adam optimizer has been shown to converge faster and achieve better performance compared to other optimization methods such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and RMSProp. However, it should be noted that the optimal optimization technique may depend on the specific problem and dataset being considered.
