The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in this context is object detection. Specifically, it is designed to identify and locate objects within images or videos. The model mentioned here is based on EfficientDet-B7, which is part of the EfficientDet framework known for its high performance and relatively low computational requirements compared to other object detection models. The goal of this model is to accurately predict class probabilities and refine bounding boxes around detected objects.
