Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about the specific code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that the trained model is hosted using TensorFlow 2.2 and served through a public-facing website developed by the authors. However, it does not give any details regarding where the source code or project files might be located. Therefore, without additional context, it is impossible to determine the exact code repository link for the deep learning pipeline.
