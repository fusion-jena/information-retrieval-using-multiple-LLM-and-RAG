Based on the given context, it is not explicitly mentioned which specific datasets were used in the deep learning pipelines for vegetation pattern identification and semantic segmentation of Brazilian savanna vegetation using high spatial resolution satellite data and U-net. However, some related works have been cited such as LeCun et al.'s work on handwritten digit recognition with a back-propagation network using the MNIST dataset [30], Krizhevsky et al.'s work on ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks [31], and Long et al.'s work on fully convolutional networks for semantic segmentation [29]. It can be inferred that similar datasets may have been used in these studies, but without explicit mention, we cannot confirm this.
