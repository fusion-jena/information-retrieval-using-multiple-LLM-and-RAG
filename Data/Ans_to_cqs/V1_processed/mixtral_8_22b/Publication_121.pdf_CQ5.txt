The deep learning pipelines mentioned in the given context utilize two main datasets - Flavia and LeafSnap. The Flavia dataset is used in conjunction with both MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3-Large models, whereas the LeafSnap dataset is employed alongside MobileNetV2, MobileNetV3-Large, and MobileNetV3-Small models. It should be noted that the exact number of iterations varies between different models and datasets, ranging from 12,000 to 200,000 overall iterations. However, no specific information regarding the usage of popular benchmark datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet has been provided within the given context.
