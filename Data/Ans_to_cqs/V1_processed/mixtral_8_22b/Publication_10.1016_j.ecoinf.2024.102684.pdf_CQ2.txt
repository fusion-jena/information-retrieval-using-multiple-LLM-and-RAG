The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, there are several clues that suggest the use of image data. Firstly, the text mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN), which are commonly used for processing grid-like topology data such as images. Secondly, the authors discuss the extraction of patterns within images using convolutional operations. Lastly, they refer to the use of multi-layer perceptron (MLP) or fully connected network architectures, which are often employed after convolutional layers in image classification tasks. Therefore, based on this context, it can be inferred that the deep learning pipeline likely uses image data.
