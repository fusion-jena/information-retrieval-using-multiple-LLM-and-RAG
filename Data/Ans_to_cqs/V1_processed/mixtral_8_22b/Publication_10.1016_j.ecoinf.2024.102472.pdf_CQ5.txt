Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, the context does provide information about the use of various types of data in different studies related to environmental change, land cover classification, and biomass estimation.

For instance, the study by Domingues et al. (2020) uses integrated multispectral and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for high-performance prediction of eucalyptus biomass using artificial neural networks. Similarly, Dube and Mutanga (2015) evaluate the utility of Landsat 8 multispectral sensor in quantifying aboveground biomass in South Africa. Memon et al. (2019) compare the performance of artificial neural networks and XGBoost algorithms for PolSAR image classification.

In addition, Miller (2014) provides a comprehensive overview of 520,000 years of environmental change in West Africa, while Douwes et al. (2015) present findings from the Buffelsdraai Landfill Site Community Reforestation Project. Mngadi et al. (2021a) explore the utility of Sentinel-2 spectral data in quantifying above-ground carbon stock in an urban reforested landscape, and Mngadi et al. (2021b) examine the effectiveness of Sentinel-1 and 2 imagery for commercial forest species mapping.

Overall, while the context does not explicitly state which datasets were used in the deep learning pipeline, it does indicate that various types of remote sensing data, including multispectral, SAR, and satellite imagery, have been employed in similar studies.
