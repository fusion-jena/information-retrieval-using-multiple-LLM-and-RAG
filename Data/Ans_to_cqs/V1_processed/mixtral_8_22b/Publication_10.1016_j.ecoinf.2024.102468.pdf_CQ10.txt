The information provided does not include any specific details about the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline used by O.P. Babalola and J. Versfeld. Therefore, I cannot provide the exact link to their code repository. However, it can be assumed that they might have shared their work on popular platforms like GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket. To find out more, one could search these platforms with keywords related to their research such as 'WT-HMM', 'North Atlantic Right Whale Up-Calls', or 'Birdnet'. Alternatively, contacting the authors directly via email or through their respective institutions may also yield results.
