The text does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does indicate that the study relies on high-resolution orthophotos with 20-cm spatial resolution obtained from an aerial survey. Therefore, one could infer that aerial surveying is a method utilized for collecting raw data in this particular deep learning pipeline. Aerial surveying involves capturing images or videos from an elevated position, typically from an aircraft or drone, to create detailed maps or models of the Earth's surface. In this case, the aerial survey likely produced high-resolution images that served as input data for the deep learning model. Other common methods for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines include using various types of sensors (e.g., cameras, LiDAR), accessing publicly available datasets, or gathering data through manual labeling efforts.
