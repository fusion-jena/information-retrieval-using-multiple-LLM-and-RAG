The text does not provide information about the metrics used to evaluate the performance of any deep learning model. However, it mentions that the accuracy of urban carbon emission estimates was evaluated by comparing the errors between the fitted values and the statistical values of carbon emissions. This suggests that error analysis might have been one of the methods used to evaluate the performance of the model employed in estimating carbon emissions. Common metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, and AUC. These metrics help determine how well the model performs in predicting or classifying new data points.
