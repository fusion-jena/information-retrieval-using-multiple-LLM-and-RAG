The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the given context is primarily for bird species recognition and related tasks. More specifically, they are used for large-scale bioacoustics analysis, which involves analyzing sounds produced by living organisms, particularly birds in this case. These models are employed to classify different bird species based on their unique acoustic features. The main advantage of using deep learning models, such as neural networks, is their ability to automatically extract relevant features from the input data without requiring manual feature engineering. This allows them to achieve high levels of accuracy in bird species classification tasks. In addition, some works have explored using various types of neural networks as species recognizers by leveraging different input features like Short-Time Fourier-Transform (STFT) and its variants, such as mel-filterbanks applied on STFT and Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC). Overall, the goal of these deep learning models is to accurately identify and classify bird species based on their distinct acoustic characteristics.
