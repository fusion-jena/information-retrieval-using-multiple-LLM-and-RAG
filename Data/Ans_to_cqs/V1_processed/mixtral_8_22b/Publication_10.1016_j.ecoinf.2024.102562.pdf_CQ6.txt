Based on the given context, it appears that the authors employed various image augmentation techniques as part of their preprocessing steps before training their deep learning models. These techniques include multiplying, applying linear contrast, sharpening, embossing, flipping horizontally and vertically, rotating, and performing affine transformations. Image augmentation is a strategy that enables practitioners to significantly increase the diversity of data available for training models, without actually collecting new data. This technique helps prevent overfitting when training a deep learning model. However, the context does not provide specific details about other common preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, based solely on this context, we cannot definitively state whether these additional preprocessing steps were also applied.
