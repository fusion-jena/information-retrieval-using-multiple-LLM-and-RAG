To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the original class proportions. This ensures that each subset has a similar distribution of classes, reducing any potential bias introduced by uneven representation.

Oversampling is a technique where additional copies of minority class examples are added to the dataset to balance it. This helps prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class. Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is a popular oversampling method that generates synthetic samples based on the existing minority instances.

Undersampling, on the other hand, reduces the number of majority class examples to achieve a more balanced dataset. Random Under-Sampling (RUS) is a simple undersampling method that randomly removes instances from the majority class until the desired balance is reached. However, this may result in loss of valuable information.

Diverse data collection aims to gather a wide range of representative examples to reduce bias caused by limited or skewed data sources. Collecting data from various locations, times, and conditions can help ensure that the dataset accurately reflects real-world scenarios and avoids overfitting to specific patterns.

These techniques should be carefully chosen and applied depending on the nature and characteristics of the dataset, as well as the specific requirements and constraints of the deep learning task.
