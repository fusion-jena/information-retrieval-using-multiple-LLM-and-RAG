The research article titled "Comparative evaluation of LSTM, CNN, and ConvLSTM for hourly short-term streamflow forecasting using deep learning approaches" published in Eco. Inform. 75, 102119 (2023) uses three types of deep learning models - Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) for hourly short-term streamflow forecasting. These models are used in a comparative evaluation to determine their performance in predicting streamflow based on historical data. The authors use these models to develop a pipeline for forecasting streamflow, which involves preprocessing the input data, training the models, and evaluating their performance. The results show that all three models perform well in predicting streamflow, but there are differences in their accuracy and computational efficiency. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the potential of deep learning models for streamflow forecasting and highlights the importance of choosing the right model for specific applications.
