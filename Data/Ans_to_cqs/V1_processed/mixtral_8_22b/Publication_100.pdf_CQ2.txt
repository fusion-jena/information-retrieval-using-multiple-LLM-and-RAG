The given context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that one of the primary data formats used is images, considering the focus on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which are predominantly employed for processing image data. CNNs have been successful in various applications such as image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection. While other data formats like audio or video might also be relevant in different deep learning pipelines, the provided context only discusses image-related applications.
