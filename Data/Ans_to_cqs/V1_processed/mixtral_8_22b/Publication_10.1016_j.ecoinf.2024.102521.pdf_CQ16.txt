Based on the given context, there is no explicit information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau or any other metric. However, it can be inferred from the context that the process involves training models using an interface provided by the website and its computational resources. Additionally, the text mentions that the performance of a task-specific classifier is presented in the Results section as case study 1, suggesting that some form of evaluation is conducted after training. Nevertheless, without further details regarding the specific methods and metrics employed during model training and evaluation, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query.
