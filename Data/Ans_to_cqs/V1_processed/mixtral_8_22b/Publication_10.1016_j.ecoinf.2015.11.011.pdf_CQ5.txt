The text does not provide information on the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it mentions the use of two types of imagery: 2009 NAIP imagery and historical imagery. These datasets likely include remote sensing data containing multiple spectral bands (Red, Green, Blue, Infrared) and additional layers like per-pixel NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and GLCM texture measures (contrast, homogeneity, dissimilarity, second moment). The pre-processing involved calculating a per-pixel NDVI layer using ArcGIS's Raster Calculator.
