The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, based on the available information, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is likely being used for classification purposes. In the context of land use classification, the authors propose an Inductive Fuzzy Transfer Learning (IFTL) technique implemented within the framework of label refinement. While the specific details of how the deep learning model fits into this technique are not provided, it is reasonable to assume that it could be utilized for classifying land use types based on input features such as satellite imagery or other relevant data sources. Additionally, the mention of a "small sample of target domain" being used as a seed to transform the source domain dataset suggests that the deep learning model might be involved in adapting the source domain data to better match the characteristics of the target domain, potentially improving the overall performance of the land use classification system.
