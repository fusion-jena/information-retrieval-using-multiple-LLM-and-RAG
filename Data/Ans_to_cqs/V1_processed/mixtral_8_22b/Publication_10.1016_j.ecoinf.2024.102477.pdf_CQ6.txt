The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to perform these preprocessing steps before training a model. Normalization involves rescaling the input features so they fall within a certain range, typically between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. Scaling refers to adjusting the values of numeric columns in the dataset to a standard scale without distorting differences in the ranges of values or losing information. Cleaning involves handling missing values, outliers, and irrelevant data points in the dataset. These preprocessing steps help improve the performance and efficiency of the deep learning model by ensuring that the input data is consistent and suitable for training.
