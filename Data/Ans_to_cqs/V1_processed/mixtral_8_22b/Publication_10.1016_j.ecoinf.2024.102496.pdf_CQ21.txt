The given context does not provide information about the postprocessing steps involved after model training such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, confusion matrix etc. However, generally speaking, some common postprocessing steps after model training could be:

* Model Evaluation: This involves calculating various evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC etc. to assess the performance of the trained model.

* Hyperparameter Tuning: This involves fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the model to improve its performance. Common techniques used for this purpose are Grid Search, Random Search, Bayesian Optimization etc.

* Visualizing Results: This involves visualizing the results obtained from the trained model using tools like confusion matrices, ROC curves, Precision-Recall curves etc. These visualizations help in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the model.

* Explainability Techniques: This involves using techniques like LIME, SHAP, GradCAM etc. to explain the predictions made by the model. These techniques help in building trust in the model and making it more interpretable.
