The purpose of the deep learning model used in this research is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, based on the information available, it appears that the model was designed for classification tasks. Specifically, the model seems to be used for classifying bird species based on their vocalizations or sounds. This is suggested by the mention of "bird species classification" among the keywords and the reference to "automated birdsong recognition." Additionally, the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) further supports this interpretation, as they are commonly employed for image and sound classification tasks. Therefore, while the exact purpose of the deep learning model cannot be definitively determined without more specific information, it can be reasonably inferred that its primary function was likely bird species classification.
