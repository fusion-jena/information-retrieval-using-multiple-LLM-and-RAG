A transformer-based network is utilized in the pipeline for the end-to-end classification of environmental microorganisms (EMs). This network combines Vision Transformer (ViT) with a self-attention module and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to achieve the best classification results. Additionally, a separable convolutional parameter-sharing attention block is employed to enable the model to capture both local and global attention features effectively.
