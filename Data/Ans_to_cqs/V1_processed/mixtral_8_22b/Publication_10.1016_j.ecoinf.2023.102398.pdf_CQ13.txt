The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model include lr0, Lrf, momentum, weight\_decay, warmup\_epochs, warmup\_momentum, warmup\_bias\_lr, box, cls, cls\_pw, obj, obj\_pw, iou\_t, anchor\_t, fl\_gamma, hsv\_h, hsv\_s, hsv\_v, degrees, translate, scale, shear, Perspective, flipud, fliplr, mosaic, mixup, and copy\_paste. Their respective values are listed in Table 2. For example, the value of lr0 is 0.01, while the value of Lrf is also 0.01. These hyperparameters play crucial roles in determining the performance of the deep learning model during training.
