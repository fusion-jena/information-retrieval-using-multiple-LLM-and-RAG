To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures have been implemented. Firstly, the size of the dataset used for custom training is sufficiently large, providing diverse examples for the model to learn from. This helps prevent overfitting and improves the model's ability to perform well on unseen data. Secondly, the model was trained using optimized hyperparameters, preventing both overfitting and underfitting situations. To achieve this, graded Mean Squared Error (MSE) convergence was adopted to fine-tune the model. Additionally, efforts to over-train the model were avoided. Lastly, the model was tested with various epoch values (100, 150, 200, and 250) under a uniform training environment and with the same dataset. This allowed for the exploration of the effect of epoch upon training results and helped determine more accurate training outcomes. These steps collectively contribute to ensuring the robustness and generalizability of the deep learning model.
