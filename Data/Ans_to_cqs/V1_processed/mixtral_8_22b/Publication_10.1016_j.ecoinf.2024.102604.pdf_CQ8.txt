The information provided does not contain any reference or link to a specific code repository for a deep learning pipeline. It appears to be related to research papers discussing various topics such as sampling biases, niche expansions, and land-use changes. To find the relevant code repositories, I recommend searching for each paper individually on platforms like Google Scholar or PubMed, then checking if their respective authors have shared any code repositories on popular version control platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
