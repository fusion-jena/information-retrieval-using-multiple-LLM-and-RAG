The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific strategies or methods used to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does provide information about various machine learning models' training times, prediction times, variance scores, R2 scores, Mean Absolute Errors (MAEs), and MAE/R2 ratios. These metrics can be used to evaluate and compare the performance of different models during training and after making predictions. Based on these evaluations, one could potentially implement a monitoring strategy involving regular checks on these metrics throughout the training process to ensure optimal performance and identify any issues early on.
