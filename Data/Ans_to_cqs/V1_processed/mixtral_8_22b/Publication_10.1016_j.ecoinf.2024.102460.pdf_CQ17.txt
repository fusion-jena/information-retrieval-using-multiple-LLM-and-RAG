Regularization methods are techniques used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise along with underlying patterns, which leads to poor generalization to new data. Two commonly used regularization methods are dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to make the network more robust and prevents complex co-adaptations on training data. Essentially, it forces the network to spread out its weights across multiple features instead of relying heavily on specific ones. Dropout is typically applied after each layer except the output layer.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay or Ridge regression, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of all the weights in the network. By adding this penalty, the optimization algorithm tries to minimize both the original loss function and the sum of squared weights. As a result, the network tends to have smaller weights overall, reducing the risk of overfitting.

Both dropout and L2 regularization can be used together or separately depending on the requirements of the task and the characteristics of the dataset. Other regularization methods include early stopping, L1 regularization (also called Lasso regression), and batch normalization. However, the context does not explicitly mention any other regularization methods besides dropout and L2 regularization.
