The context does not provide explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, based on common practices in machine learning, some possible postprocessing steps could include calculating evaluation metrics such as Mean Square Error (MSE), Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE), and accuracy (%). These metrics have been used in this case to evaluate the performance of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for various tasks like predicting river age, sea age, and spawning. Additionally, creating visualizations like saliency maps can help understand which parts of the input image were most important for the model's predictions. Lastly, constructing confusion matrices can also be useful for understanding the types of errors made by the model during prediction.
