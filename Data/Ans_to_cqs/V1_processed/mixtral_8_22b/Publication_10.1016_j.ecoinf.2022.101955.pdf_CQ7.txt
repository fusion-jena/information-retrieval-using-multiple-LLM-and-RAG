The authors used 80% of their data as test files and the remaining 20% as validation files. They used the 'createDataPartition()' function from the 'caret' package in R to allocate this data. The test datasets were used to check optimal model parameters and initial model performance based on repeated cross-validation. On the other hand, the validation dataset was used to check the final model accuracy.
