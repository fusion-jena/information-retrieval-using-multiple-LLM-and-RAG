The text does not provide explicit information about the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, including details like model serialization or platform selection. However, based on common practices in deploying deep learning models, one could infer that after training the model using libraries such as TensorFlow, the model might have been serialized into a format suitable for deployment, such as a.h5 file for Keras models or a.pb file for TensorFlow models. As for platform selection, depending on the application requirements, the model could have been deployed on various platforms, ranging from cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure to edge devices like mobile phones or embedded systems. Nevertheless, without concrete evidence from the provided context, these assumptions remain speculative.
