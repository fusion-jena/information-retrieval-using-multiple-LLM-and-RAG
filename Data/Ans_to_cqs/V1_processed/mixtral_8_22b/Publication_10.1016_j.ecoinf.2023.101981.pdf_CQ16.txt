The given context does not provide information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete or any mention of validation loss plateau. However, based on general machine learning practices, common criteria to determine when training is complete include reaching a predefined number of epochs, achieving a desired level of accuracy or performance, observing no further improvement in validation loss or accuracy, or meeting other custom stopping conditions. In this case, without explicit details from the provided context, it cannot be definitively stated what criteria are used to determine when training is complete.
