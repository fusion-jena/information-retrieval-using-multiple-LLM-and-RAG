Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to determine the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The context mentions GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility), which is a data repository, but it doesn't specify whether a deep learning pipeline has been stored there. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct link to the deep learning pipeline in a data repository like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
