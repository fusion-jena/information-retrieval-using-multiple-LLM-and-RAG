The text does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, it mentions that the learning rate used for training the network was 0.03. This suggests that some form of optimization or tuning might have been performed beforehand to determine this value. Unfortunately, without further details, it cannot be confirmed whether methods like grid search, random search, or other optimization techniques were employed.
