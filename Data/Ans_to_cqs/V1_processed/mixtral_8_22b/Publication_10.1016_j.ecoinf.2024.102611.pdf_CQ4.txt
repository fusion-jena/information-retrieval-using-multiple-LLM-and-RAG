The given context does not provide specific information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. Data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, zooming, and others are commonly used to increase the size of training datasets and prevent overfitting. These techniques generate new images from existing ones by applying various transformations. However, without explicit mention in the provided context, it cannot be confirmed which specific data augmentation techniques were employed in the discussed deep learning pipelines.
