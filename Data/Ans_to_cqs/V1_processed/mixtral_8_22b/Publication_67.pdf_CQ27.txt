The text does not provide explicit information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that after the validation phase, where the performance of the model is assessed on new images, the next step would typically involve deploying the model for practical use. This could include processes such as model serialization, platform selection, or integration into existing systems. Unfortunately, without specific details mentioned in the given context, it is impossible to provide a precise description of the deployment process.
