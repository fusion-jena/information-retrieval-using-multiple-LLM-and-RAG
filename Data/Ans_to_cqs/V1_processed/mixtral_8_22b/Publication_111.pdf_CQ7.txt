The context does not provide explicit information on the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it mentions that the training data is separated into training and validation groups to track the generalization performance. This suggests that the data might be divided based on a common practice where the dataset is typically split into three subsets: training set, validation set, and testing set. The training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set is used to tune the model's hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Lastly, the testing set is used to evaluate the final model's performance. The exact proportions or methods used to divide the data are not specified in the given context.
