Based on the given information, it is not explicitly stated what specific type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline. However, it does mention that Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approaches are required for a large corpus of high-quality annotated data. This suggests that a CNN might be utilized in their pipeline, although it could also mean they considered using one due to its requirements. Unfortunately, without more explicit details about the architecture or methodology employed, we cannot definitively determine if a CNN, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Transformer, or another type of deep learning model was used in the pipeline.
