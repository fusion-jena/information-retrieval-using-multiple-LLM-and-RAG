Based on the given context, it is not possible to determine which specific optimization techniques were used in the deep learning pipeline for this study. The context does not provide any information about the methodology or tools used for data analysis, including whether machine learning or deep learning models were employed. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate response to the query regarding the use of optimization techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) in this case.
