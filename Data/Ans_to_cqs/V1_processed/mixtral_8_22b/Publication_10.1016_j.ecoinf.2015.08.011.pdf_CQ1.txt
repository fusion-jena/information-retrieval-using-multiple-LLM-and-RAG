The provided context does not explicitly mention specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. However, it can be inferred from the sources cited that various types of data collection methods were employed in these studies.

For instance, Mohseni et al. (2003) studied the impact of global warming on fish habitat in US streams, suggesting they likely collected data related to water temperature, stream flow, and other relevant variables. Similarly, Park et al. (2003) investigated aquatic insect species richness in running waters, implying they gathered data on factors affecting those ecosystems. Patz et al. (1998) explored dengue fever epidemics, indicating they may have used health surveillance data. Reiter (2001) focused on climate change and mosquito-borne diseases, possibly involving meteorological and entomological data. Revich et al. (2012) examined climate change and zoonotic infections in the Russian Arctic, potentially employing both climatic and medical records.

Moreover, several papers mentioned the use of hydroacoustic surveys (Brosse et al., 1999) and time series analysis (Chartfield, 2003; Diggle, 1990). These techniques suggest the utilization of sensor data and historical records, respectively. Additionally, Dopazo et al. (1997) discussed a new type of unsupervised growing neural network for biological sequence classification, hinting at the use of genetic databases. Lastly, references to MATLAB and Statistics Toolbox (2014a, 2014b) indicate the application of statistical software tools for processing and analyzing data.

Overall, while the exact methods for gathering raw data are not specified, the research topics and analytical approaches described in the given context imply the use of diverse data collection methods, including but not limited to surveys, sensors, and public datasets.
