The given context does not provide explicit details about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. However, based on general practices in machine learning and deep learning applications, we can infer some possible ways of gathering raw data for this domain.

In the field of bird species recognition using deep learning, researchers often rely on audio recordings of bird sounds collected through various means. Some common sources include:

1. Public Datasets: Researchers may use publicly available datasets containing pre-recorded bird sound samples. Examples of these datasets include BirdCLEF (Joly et al., 2017), iBird (Liu et al., 2016), and Warblr (Sparks et al., 2017). These datasets usually contain labeled bird vocalizations, which can be useful for supervised learning tasks like bird species identification.

2. Surveys: Field biologists conduct acoustic surveys to collect bird sound recordings. This involves capturing bird calls and songs using specialized equipment like microphones and digital recorders. These surveys can take place in different habitats and seasons to gather diverse bird vocalizations.

3. Sensors: Automatic recording units (ARUs) equipped with sensitive microphones can be deployed in the wild to continuously monitor bird activity. ARUs can capture high-quality bird sound recordings over extended periods, providing large volumes of data for deep learning models.

While the given context does not explicitly mention any of these methods, they represent commonly employed techniques for gathering raw data in similar domains.
