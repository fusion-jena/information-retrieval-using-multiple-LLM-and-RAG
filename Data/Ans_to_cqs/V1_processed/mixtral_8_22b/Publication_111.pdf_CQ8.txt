The article does not mention where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The authors only state that the deep learning model was implemented in Python programming language version 3.8.5 but do not specify any specific code repositories such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, it is not possible to determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available based solely on the information presented in the article.
