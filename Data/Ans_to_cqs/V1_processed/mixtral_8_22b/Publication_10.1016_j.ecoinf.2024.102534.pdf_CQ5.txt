The given context does not provide information about any specific dataset used in a deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it mentions several authors who have written on various topics related to ecology, botany, and geographical data. The only reference to a dataset is from the U.S. Geological Survey, which provides digital elevation data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). This dataset could potentially be used in a deep learning pipeline for tasks like terrain analysis or land cover classification, but without further context, we cannot confirm its use in this manner.
