Based on the given context, there is no information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the IFBA database stores datasets generated by systems, programs, and individual researchers within the institute. It also mentions that the system is specifically designed for scales and otoliths, but is flexible enough to be adapted for any biological sample type. Therefore, it can be assumed that the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline would likely include images or other forms of data related to scales and otoliths, as well as potentially other biological samples. Without more specific information, however, it is not possible to provide a definitive list of the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
