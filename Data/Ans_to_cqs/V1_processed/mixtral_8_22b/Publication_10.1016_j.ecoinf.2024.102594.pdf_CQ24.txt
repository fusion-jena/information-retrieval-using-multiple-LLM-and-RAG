The text does not provide explicit information on handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it mentions several strategies employed during the training process of the DeepLabV3+ model to enhance the dataset and prevent overfitting. These techniques can be considered as ways to introduce controlled randomness and variability into the training data. They include:

1. Image flipping: Images and labels are flipped along the X or Y axes, which introduces new perspectives and patterns for the model to learn from.
2. Channel exchange: Multiple image channels are exchanged while keeping the labels unchanged. This helps the model generalize better by learning features independent of their specific channel representation.
3. Rotation: Images and labels are randomly rotated by 90 degrees. This augmentation technique allows the model to recognize objects regardless of their orientation.
4. Noise addition: Random noise is added to the images while maintaining the labels unchanged. This strategy helps improve the model's robustness against noisy inputs and enhances its ability to focus on relevant features.

These methods contribute to reducing the impact of randomness in the deep learning pipeline by increasing the diversity and complexity of the training data. Although they do not directly address issues related to random seed values, these strategies help mitigate the effects of randomness by promoting model generalization and preventing overfitting.
