The text does not provide explicit information about the method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the dataset consists of 35,573 images for each of the 12 channels, covering 35 species and resulting in a total of 426,876 images. These images were then center cropped to an equally sized rectangle. Additionally, the images in the training set were augmented through various techniques such as flipping horizontally and vertically, adjusting brightness, saturation, contrast, and hue. Therefore, it can be inferred that the raw data collection involved capturing multispectral images of pollen grains from different plant species using some form of imaging technology. However, the specifics of this process, including whether it involved surveys, sensors, or public datasets, are not mentioned in the given context.
