Unfortunately, based on the given information, there is no mention of where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It does not provide any links or references to a specific code repository hosted on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot determine the exact location of the code repository.
