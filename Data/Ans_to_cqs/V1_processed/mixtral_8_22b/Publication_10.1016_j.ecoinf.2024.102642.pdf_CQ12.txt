The text mentions that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used in the pipeline. Specifically, CNN models are trained using each annotation set to study the impact of inter-annotator variability on the performance of deep learning models. Therefore, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is CNN.
