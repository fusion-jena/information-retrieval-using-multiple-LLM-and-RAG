The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps involved after model training such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices. However, based on general practices in machine learning, some common postprocessing steps include evaluating the performance of the trained model using various evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc. This can be done by creating a confusion matrix, which is a table layout that allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm. Additionally, generating saliency maps can help understand how the model arrived at its predictions by highlighting important features in the input data. Other possible postprocessing steps may involve fine-tuning hyperparameters, ensemble modeling, or deploying the model into production environments.
