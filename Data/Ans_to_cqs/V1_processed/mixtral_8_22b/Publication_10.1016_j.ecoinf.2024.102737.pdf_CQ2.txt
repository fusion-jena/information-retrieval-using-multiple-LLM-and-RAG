Based on the given context, it can be inferred that the deep learning pipeline uses image data format. This is evident from several mentions of images throughout the text, including references to 320 x 320 pixel images, variations in image characteristics like contrast and brightness, and the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are typically employed for processing grid-like topology data such as images. However, the context does not provide explicit information about other data formats like audio, video, or CSV being used in the deep learning pipeline.
