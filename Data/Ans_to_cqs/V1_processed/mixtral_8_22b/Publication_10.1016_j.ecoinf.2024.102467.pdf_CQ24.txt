None of the given context mentions any specific strategy to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline such as random seed values. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to use techniques like setting fixed seeds or using deterministic algorithms to ensure reproducibility and consistency across different runs. These methods help control the randomness introduced by various components in the pipeline, including weight initialization, batch selection, and data augmentation. But without explicit mention in the provided text, I cannot provide a more detailed answer.
