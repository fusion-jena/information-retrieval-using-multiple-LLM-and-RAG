During the training and validation of the models, a stratified train-test split was employed. This procedure is particularly beneficial for imbalanced datasets as it maintains the proportion, in our case 80%â€“20%, for each class of the original dataset. This means that every class has approximately 80% of its samples in the train set and approximately 20% in the validation set. This ensures that all classes participate in both the training and validation phases of the model. However, this stratified train-test split was not applied to the dataset composed of trajectories of length 13, but rather to the original trajectories of variable length. This was done to ensure that each trajectory belongs exclusively to either the train or validation splits, but not both. As a consequence, in terms of fixed-length trajectories, each with a length of 13, we obtained 13,489 samples in training and 3448 samples in validation.
