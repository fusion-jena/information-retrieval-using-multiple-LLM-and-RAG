The text does not provide explicit information about the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that they used a deep neural network algorithm (IUC-NN), which could potentially include various regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization. Cross-validation was also employed to quantify the average validation cross-entropy loss and accuracy, which can help detect and mitigate overfitting. Nevertheless, without further details regarding the implementation of these methods, it cannot be confirmed if dropout, L2 regularization, or other techniques were specifically utilized in this study.
