Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the use of Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for estimating species distribution using bioclimatic variables and the comparison of UMAP with other Dimensional Reduction Methods (DRMs). It discusses the advantages of UMAP over traditional linear DRMs and mentions the potential impact of hyperparameters on UMAP's performance. Additionally, it describes the process of embedding testing data into the UMAP model and calculating the nearest neighbor Euclidean distance between species-species and background-species. However, details regarding the validation techniques employed to ensure the robustness and generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
