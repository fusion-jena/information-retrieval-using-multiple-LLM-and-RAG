The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), varies depending on its application. In this context, CNNs are used to solve different problems, including classification, regression, object detection, and semantic- and instance-based segmentation. The specific purpose of the model is determined by its architecture, output function, and labeling process.

For instance, the regression approach based on CNN architectures receives an image and passes it through a series of convolutional layers connected to a fully connected network, with a linear or sigmoid output function. This approach is practical and easy to interpret, allowing direct estimation of continuous transitions and patterns in the landscape, such as plant covers.

On the other hand, semantic segmentation, such as using the UNet model, is another application of CNNs. Semantic segmentation involves assigning a label to every pixel in an image, thus understanding what objects are present in the scene and where they are located.

In summary, the purpose of the deep learning model in this context could be either regression or semantic segmentation, depending on the specific implementation and desired outcome.
