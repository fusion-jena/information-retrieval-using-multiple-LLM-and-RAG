Based on the given context, it appears that the authors have implemented several strategies to prevent overfitting in their deep learning pipeline. However, they did not explicitly mention the use of common regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization. Instead, they focused on other techniques to mitigate overfitting.

One approach mentioned in the text is the use of data augmentation techniques, including scaling, panning, rotation, color transformation, and mosaic. These techniques help increase the number of training samples and improve the model's generalization ability by introducing variations in the dataset.

Additionally, the authors ensured that the models followed back-propagation after accumulating the batch size 32 times. This strategy helps prevent underfitting by allowing the model to learn more effectively from larger batches of data.

Furthermore, the authors employed pretrained weights to evaluate their impact on detection results. Using pretrained weights can act as a form of regularization since these weights have already been optimized for similar tasks, which may help reduce overfitting when fine-tuning the model for a new task.

Lastly, the authors used a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer with an initial learning rate of 0.01 and a cycle learning rate of 0.2. Learning rate decay was also applied after specific iterations. These optimization strategies can contribute to preventing overfitting by controlling the learning process and avoiding rapid convergence to suboptimal solutions.
