The text does not provide explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that users can manually label some of their images and trigger retraining. This suggests that one possible technique could be manual annotation, where users draw bounding boxes around objects or perform instance segmentation to outline individual instances within an image. Additionally, the mention of downloadable images and their box annotations (Comma Separated Values, csv, files) implies that bounding box annotation might be employed. Nevertheless, without further clarification, it remains uncertain whether these are the only annotation techniques utilized in the deep learning pipeline.
