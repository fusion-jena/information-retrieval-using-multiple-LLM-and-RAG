Unfortunately, based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that the generated GIS layer of the historical geographical distribution of wetlands is released as an open resource and can be freely used. However, it does not specify where this resource is made available. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to your query.
