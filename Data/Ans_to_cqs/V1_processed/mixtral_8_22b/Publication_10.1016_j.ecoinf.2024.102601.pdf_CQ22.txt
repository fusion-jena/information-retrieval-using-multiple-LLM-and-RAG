The study uses two primary evaluation metrics to assess the performance of their machine learning model: Overall Accuracy (OA) and Cohen's Kappa statistic. OA measures the proportion of correctly predicted instances (both wildfire-affected and unaffected areas) out of all instances evaluated. Mathematically, it is represented as the sum of true positives and true negatives divided by the total number of instances. On the other hand, Cohen's Kappa statistic is a measure of inter-rater reliability or agreement between two raters who each classify items into mutually exclusive categories. In this case, it helps understand how well the model's predictions align with actual ground truth labels. These metrics are crucial for comprehending the model's effectiveness in accurately identifying areas impacted by wildfires.
