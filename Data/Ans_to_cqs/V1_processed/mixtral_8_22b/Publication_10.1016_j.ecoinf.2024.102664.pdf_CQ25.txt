The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred based on its application and components. Given that the study focuses on forecasting algal blooms using satellite data, it is likely that the deep learning models serve a predictive or regression function. This is further supported by the presence of a regression output layer in both the CNN and LSTM models described. Therefore, the primary purpose of these deep learning models appears to be making predictions about future algal blooms based on historical satellite data.
