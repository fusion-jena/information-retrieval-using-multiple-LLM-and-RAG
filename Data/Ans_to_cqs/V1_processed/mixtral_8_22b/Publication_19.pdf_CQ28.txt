The given context does not provide explicit information regarding which specific cloud platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the proposed IoT-based system leverages edge computing to perform inference directly on the edge using a Raspberry Pi (RPi). Therefore, we can infer that the deep learning model might have been deployed locally on the Raspberry Pi device rather than being hosted on any major cloud platforms mentioned earlier.
