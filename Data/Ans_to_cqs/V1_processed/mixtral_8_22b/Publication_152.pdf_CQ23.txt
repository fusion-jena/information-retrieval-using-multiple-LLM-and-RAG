From the given context, it is not explicitly mentioned what specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning models used for vegetation segmentation and identification tasks using UAV images. However, there are some indicators suggesting potential strategies employed by researchers.

Firstly, the use of data augmentation techniques such as small changes in brightness and zoom can help improve the F1 score significantly. This implies that various transformations applied to the original image dataset could have been utilized to increase its diversity and robustness, thereby enhancing the model's ability to generalize well on unseen data.

Secondly, the authors mention testing the U-Net neural network with a relatively small amount of data [21], which suggests they might have implemented some form of cross-validation or stratified splitting during their experiments. These methods involve dividing the available dataset into multiple subsets, where each subset serves as either training, validation, or test data. By doing so, one can evaluate the performance of the model across different portions of the dataset, ensuring better generalization capabilities.

Additionally, the authors propose using RGB images captured by a UAV as input for training the final network [23]. Since these images would likely contain varying lighting conditions, angles, and distances from the ground, this approach further contributes to creating a diverse dataset that promotes improved model generalizability.

Overall, while the exact measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning models are not explicitly stated in the provided context, several indicators suggest possible strategies like data augmentation, cross-validation, and utilizing diverse datasets.
