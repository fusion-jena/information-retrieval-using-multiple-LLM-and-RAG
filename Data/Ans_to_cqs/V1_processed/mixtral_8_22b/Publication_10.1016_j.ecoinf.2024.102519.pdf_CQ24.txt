Based on the given context, there isn't any direct information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or setting random seed values. However, I can provide some general strategies often employed to manage randomness in deep learning models:

1. Fixed Random Seeds: One common approach is to fix the random seed value before training the model. This ensures reproducibility across experiments since the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers will be generated each time.

2. Multiple Runs: To account for variability due to random initialization, it is recommended to perform multiple runs using different random seeds. This allows for averaging out the effects of randomness and obtaining a more robust estimate of the model's performance.

3. Cross-Validation: Another strategy is to use cross-validation techniques like k-fold cross-validation. By splitting the dataset into several folds and repeating the experiment multiple times, this technique reduces the impact of randomness on the final result.

4. Ensemble Methods: Combining predictions from multiple models trained with different random seeds can help improve overall performance and reduce variance caused by randomness.
