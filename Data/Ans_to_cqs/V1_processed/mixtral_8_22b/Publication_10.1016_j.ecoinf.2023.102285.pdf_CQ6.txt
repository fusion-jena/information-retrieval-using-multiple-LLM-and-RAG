Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, common practices in machine learning and deep learning include data normalization, scaling, cleaning, and augmentation. Normalization involves rescaling numeric columns to a standard scale, while scaling adjusts values measured on different scales to a common scale. Cleaning refers to handling missing or inconsistent data points, and augmentation generates additional training samples through various transformations like rotation, flipping, zooming, etc. These preprocessing steps help improve the performance and convergence speed of the deep learning model.
