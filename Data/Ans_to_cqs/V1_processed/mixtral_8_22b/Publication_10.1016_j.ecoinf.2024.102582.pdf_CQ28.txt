The text does not explicitly state which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform was used for retrieving atmospherically corrected United States Geological Survey Landsat Surface reflectance products. It also highlights the use of the GEE cloud platform for various applications, including mangrove extraction in coastal zones, aquaculture ponds, marsh wetlands, and intertidal zones. Furthermore, it discusses the advantages of the GEE cloud platform, such as superior storage and computing capabilities, and its ability to significantly improve accuracy by employing a powerful background processing calculator. Therefore, while it cannot be definitively stated without further information, there is evidence suggesting that the Google Cloud Platform may have been used to deploy the deep learning model.
