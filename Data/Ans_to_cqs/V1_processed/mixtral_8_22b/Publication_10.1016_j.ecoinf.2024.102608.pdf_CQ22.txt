The study uses three main metrics to evaluate the performance of the machine learning models: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination (R^2). These metrics help assess the discrepancies between the model's predicted and observed values, with lower MAE and RMSE values indicating better performance. Additionally, higher R^2 values suggest a stronger correlation between the predicted and observed values. In this case, Random Forest (RF) was found to be the best performing algorithm based on its superior results across all three metrics compared to other models such as KNN, AdaBoost, and ANN.
