The text does not provide explicit information about the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions the use of a learning rate of 0.001 and a decay factor of 16 every 30 epochs, along with the RMSProp optimization algorithm with a momentum of 0.9 and epsilon of 0.1. These details suggest that the authors might have monitored the model performance during training by observing metrics such as loss or accuracy after each epoch and adjusting the learning rate and other hyperparameters accordingly. Additionally, they may have employed techniques like early stopping or validation set monitoring to prevent overfitting and ensure optimal model performance.
