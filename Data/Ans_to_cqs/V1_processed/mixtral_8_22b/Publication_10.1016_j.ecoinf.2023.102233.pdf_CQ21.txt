The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, based on common practices in machine learning, some possible postprocessing steps could include calculating metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate the performance of the trained model. Additionally, creating confusion matrices can help visualize the performance of the classifier and identify any potential issues with imbalanced classes. Other techniques like saliency maps might also be employed to understand how the model makes its decisions and what features it focuses on when making predictions. Nevertheless, without further details regarding the specific implementation, these suggestions remain speculative.
