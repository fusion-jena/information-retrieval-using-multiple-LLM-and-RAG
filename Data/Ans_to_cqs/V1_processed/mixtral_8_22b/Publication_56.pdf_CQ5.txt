Based on the given context, it does not provide specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions several types of remote sensing data such as Sentinel-2 time series, lidar, and RGB data. It also discusses various applications of deep learning in remote sensing, including parameter estimation, image classification, and anomaly detection. Therefore, it can be inferred that the datasets used in these applications would likely consist of remote sensing data rather than commonly used computer vision datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
