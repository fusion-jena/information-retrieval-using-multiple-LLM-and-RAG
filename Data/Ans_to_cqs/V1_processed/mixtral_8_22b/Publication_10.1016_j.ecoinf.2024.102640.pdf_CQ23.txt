To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model used in GreenCam, several measures have been taken. Firstly, the model was trained using a customized dataset that covers a wide range of urban settings. This includes various types of green spaces like parks, gardens, campuses, and urban forests, as well as areas with varying levels of urban green density. By incorporating this diverse set of environments into the training data, the model can learn to accurately predict GVI in a variety of scenarios.

Secondly, data augmentation techniques were employed to enhance the robustness of the model. These techniques included random rotations, scaling, and flipping of images. The purpose of these transformations is to artificially expand the size of the dataset while maintaining its inherent diversity. Consequently, the model becomes more capable of handling variations in input data, thereby improving its ability to generalize.

Lastly, efforts are being made to continuously improve the dataset by adding photos from different cities and climates. This expansion aims to capture a broader range of urban environmental conditions, thus increasing the overall diversity of the dataset. Additionally, since GVI changes with the seasons, collecting images throughout the year is another strategy to boost dataset diversity. Furthermore, addressing imbalances in category representation within the dataset is crucial to prevent any potential bias during prediction. Therefore, future plans involve increasing the number of annotations for underrepresented categories, such as facilities and flowers.

These combined strategies contribute to enhancing the generalizability of the deep learning model, enabling it to perform effectively across a wide array of real-world situations.
