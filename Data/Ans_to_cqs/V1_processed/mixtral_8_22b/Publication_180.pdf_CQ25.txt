The purpose of the deep learning model used in this study is classification. Specifically, it aims to identify and distinguish between various Mexican and Brazilian triatomine species from digital images. This is done with the goal of improving upon the accuracy of previously developed statistical classifiers. The model uses TensorFlow, an open-source software platform designed for deep learning algorithms, and has shown promising results with improved identification rates compared to earlier methods.
