From the given context, it is not explicitly mentioned what specific preprocessing steps were taken for this particular work. However, generally speaking, when preparing data for training a deep learning model such as U-Net, common preprocessing steps may include image resizing or cropping, normalization, augmentation, and label encoding. Image resizing or cropping ensures all images have consistent dimensions. Normalization scales pixel values to a standard range, typically between 0 and 1, which helps improve convergence during training. Data augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, zooming, brightness adjustment, etc., can be applied to increase the amount of training data and prevent overfitting. Label encoding involves converting class labels into numerical form so they can be used by the model. In this case, since the goal was to identify Hedychium Coronarium, an invasive vegetation species, the images would likely need to be labeled accordingly.
