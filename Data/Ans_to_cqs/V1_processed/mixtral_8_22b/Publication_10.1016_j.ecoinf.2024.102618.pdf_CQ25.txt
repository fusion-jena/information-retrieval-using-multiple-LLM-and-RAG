The purpose of the deep learning models used in this study is to classify plant diseases. The authors have proposed five different deep-learning models for this task, including DenseNet201, efficientNetB0, efficientNetB3, Inceptionresnetv2, and ResNet50v2. Additionally, they have suggested using various ensembles of these models to improve classification accuracy further. These models are designed to learn features from input images automatically and use them to predict the presence or absence of specific plant diseases accurately.
