The paper does not provide specific information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that data augmentation was performed to increase the size of the training dataset. Common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, and adding noise to images. These techniques help improve the model's ability to generalize and prevent overfitting. In this case, the authors likely employed some combination of these techniques to enhance their training dataset.

I am sorry, but I cannot find any information regarding the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The paper does not mention anything about this topic.
