The text mentions that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are typically executed on GPU hardware due to faster training times. However, in this case, the authors intentionally chose to train their ResNet152V2 model on CPUs instead of GPUs. They used a virtual machine running the "E2asV4" instance on Microsoft Azure, equipped with 16GB RAM and a 2.35GHz AMD EPYCâ„¢ 7452 2 vCPU. This setup allowed them to demonstrate that it is possible to train pre-trained models on less expensive hardware, making them more accessible to researchers and practitioners who may not have access to high-end GPU resources.
