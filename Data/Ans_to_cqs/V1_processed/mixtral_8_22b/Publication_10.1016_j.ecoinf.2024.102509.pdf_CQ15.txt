The given context does not provide specific information about the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. However, it is mentioned that the Backpropagation Artificial Neural Network (BP-ANN) used in this case modifies the weights and biases of the network's neurons to minimize the gap between the anticipated output and the actual target values. This indicates that some form of gradient descent optimization technique might be employed, but the exact method is not specified. Additionally, the 'neuralnet' package of R 4.1.2 software is utilized for training multi-layer perceptrons in regression analyses, which could potentially involve various optimization techniques depending on the implementation details of the package.
