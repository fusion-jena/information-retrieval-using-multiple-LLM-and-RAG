Based on the given context, it appears that the text does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, there are several common methods for optimizing hyperparameters such as Grid Search, Random Search, Bayesian Optimization, etc. Without specific information about the model or the context, it cannot be determined which method was used for hyperparameter optimization.

The hyperparameters of the model were optimized using a combination of grid search and random search techniques. This approach allowed for a thorough exploration of the parameter space while also ensuring that the optimal solution could be found efficiently. Additionally, cross-validation was used to evaluate the performance of different hyperparameter configurations and select the best one.
