Based on the given context, there is no specific information about the evaluation metrics used for the deep learning model. However, common metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, and area under the curve (AUC). Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of total predictions made. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made. Recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of actual positives. F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. ROC curve plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate, while AUC represents the degree of separability between classes. These metrics can be used individually or combined to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance.
