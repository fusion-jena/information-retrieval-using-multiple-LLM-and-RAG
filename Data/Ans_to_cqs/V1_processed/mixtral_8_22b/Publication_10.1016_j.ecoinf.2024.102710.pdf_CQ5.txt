The deep learning pipelines mentioned in the given context utilize various datasets for training and evaluation purposes. These include ImageNet, a large-scale dataset containing millions of images categorized into thousands of classes, which has been employed for pretraining models like ResNet152-V2 and VGG16. Additionally, AudioSet, another extensive dataset comprising YouTube sound clips, serves as the basis for pretraining models such as VGGish and YAMNet. Furthermore, BirdNet has been trained on bird vocalizations from focal recordings, while other studies have utilized smaller, targeted datasets collected from sources like Macaulay Library.
