In the given context, the Elastic Net (Enet) algorithm is discussed as a regularization method used to prevent overfitting. It combines two popular regularization techniques - Lasso (L1) and Ridge (L2) regressions. Both these techniques add penalty terms to the loss function during optimization, causing some coefficients to become zero or close to zero, effectively removing them from the model.

Lasso Regression uses L1 regularization, which adds absolute size of coefficient as penalty term to the loss function. This leads to sparse solutions, i.e., many variables have zero weights.

Ridge Regression uses L2 regularization, which adds squared size of coefficient as penalty term to the loss function. This results in smaller coefficients, making the model simpler and less likely to overfit.

Elastic Net combines both L1 and L2 regularizations, allowing for a balance between the two. This is done by introducing a new parameter called 'alpha', which controls the overall strength of regularization, and another parameter called 'l1_ratio'. The latter determines the proportion of L1 vs L2 regularization. When l1_ratio=1, Elastic Net becomes equivalent to Lasso Regression, while when l1_ratio=0, it becomes equivalent to Ridge Regression.

Therefore, in the context of the deep learning pipeline mentioned, Elastic Net could be used as a regularization method to prevent overfitting, combining the benefits of both Lasso and Ridge Regressions. Other common regularization methods include Dropout, Early Stopping, and Batch Normalization. However, these are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
