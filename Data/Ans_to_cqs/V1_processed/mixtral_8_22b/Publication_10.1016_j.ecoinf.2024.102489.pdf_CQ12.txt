Based on the given information, it appears that the study does not use a deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. Instead, the study uses a Random Forest (RF) model, which is a machine learning algorithm based on a classification tree proposed by Breiman (1996, 2001). The RF model is widely used in regression and classification tasks and has several advantages over other black-box machine learning algorithms. It has a high tolerance for noisy datasets, is easy to implement, has low computational overhead, is highly interpretable, effectively prevents variable collinearity, avoids model overfitting, and provides good prediction ability for high-dimensional datasets. In this study, the authors used a grid search method (GridSearchCV) based on the out-of-bag (OOB) error and five-fold cross-validation to search for the optimal parameters of the model. They varied the number of trees (n\_estimators), minimum number of leaves (minleaf), and number of randomly selected node-split feature variables (max\_features) to find the best combination of these parameters. Therefore, the study does not use any deep learning models but instead relies on the Random Forest model for its predictions.
