The given context does not provide information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it mentions two methods used for feature elimination and improving model performance: Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Variable Selection Using Random Forests (VSURF). These methods help reduce overfitting and improve generalization by selecting relevant features from the dataset. While they do not directly address data bias, they can indirectly mitigate its effects by reducing noise and irrelevant information in the input data.
