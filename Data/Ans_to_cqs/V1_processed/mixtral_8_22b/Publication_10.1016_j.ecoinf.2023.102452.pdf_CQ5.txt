The given context does not provide information on specific datasets used in any deep learning pipelines such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it focuses on various research papers related to hydrological forecasting, data-driven modeling, and other topics. Therefore, based on this context alone, we cannot determine which datasets were used in any deep learning pipelines.
