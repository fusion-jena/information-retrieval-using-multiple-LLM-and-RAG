The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it does discuss the use of a deep learning model combined with an optimization algorithm to detect the dispersal of the early stages of spotted butterfish in northern Vietnam under global warming. This suggests that some form of optimization technique was likely employed within the deep learning pipeline, but without further information, we cannot definitively state which specific method was utilized.
