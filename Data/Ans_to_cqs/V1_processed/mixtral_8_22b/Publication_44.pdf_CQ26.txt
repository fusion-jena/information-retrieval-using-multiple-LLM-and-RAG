The text does not provide explicit information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some general approaches to handling data imbalance or bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets such that each subset maintains the class distribution of the overall dataset. Oversampling increases the size of minority classes by duplicating samples, while undersampling reduces the size of majority classes by removing samples. These methods help balance the dataset and prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.

Diverse data collection aims to gather a wide range of examples representing various scenarios, conditions, and variations within the target domain. By collecting diverse data, the model can learn more robust features and become less sensitive to noise or outliers.

In summary, although the given text does not mention any specific technique used to handle data bias, common strategies include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.
