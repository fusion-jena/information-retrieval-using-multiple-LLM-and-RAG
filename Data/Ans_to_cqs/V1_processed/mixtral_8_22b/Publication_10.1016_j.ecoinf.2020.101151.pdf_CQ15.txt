Based on the given context, there is no information about the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of the nine-cell approach for smoothing data inaccuracies within single grid cells, leading to improved prediction results. It also mentions the development of a new grassland fire index and the inclusion of high-resolution data layers for improving prediction accuracy. However, these details do not provide any insight into the optimization techniques employed in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based on the given context.
