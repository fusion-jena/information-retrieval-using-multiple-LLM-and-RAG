Before training a deep learning model such as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), several preprocessing steps can be applied to the input data. These steps may include normalization, scaling, cleaning, or even transforming the data into smaller chunks.

In this case, the authors processed large orthophotos into smaller labeled tiles (image cubes) of 256 x 256 pixels due to memory limitations and computation efficiency. This step can be considered as a form of data transformation where larger images are broken down into manageable sizes.

Normalization is another common preprocessing technique used to scale pixel intensity values between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. However, there isn't any explicit mention of normalization being performed in this specific scenario.

Cleaning the data might involve removing irrelevant features, handling missing values, or correcting inconsistencies. Again, no specific information about these processes has been mentioned here.

Therefore, based on the given context, the primary preprocessing step involves dividing large orthophotos into smaller tiles for efficient processing and training of the CNN.
