Based on the given context, there is no explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when the training of the organ detection model is complete. However, it can be inferred that the model was trained until satisfactory results were achieved, as evidenced by its good performance during visual inspections and the use of average precision metrics for evaluation. Additionally, the fact that the model was able to significantly reduce the time required for manual annotations suggests that it had been adequately trained. Typically, common criteria used to determine when training is complete include reaching a validation loss plateau or achieving a desired accuracy threshold. Without further context, we cannot definitively state what criteria were used in this case.
