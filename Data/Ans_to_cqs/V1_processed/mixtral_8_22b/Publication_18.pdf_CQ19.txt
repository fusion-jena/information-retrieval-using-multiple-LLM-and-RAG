The papers cited do not explicitly mention the specific deep learning frameworks used to build the deep learning models. However, it can be assumed that popular frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch were likely used due to their widespread adoption in the research community. These frameworks offer high-level APIs for building and training deep learning models, making them accessible to researchers and practitioners alike. Additionally, they support GPU acceleration, allowing for faster training times and enabling the development of more complex models. Ultimately, while we cannot definitively state which framework was used in these studies, it is reasonable to infer that one of the commonly used ones was employed.
