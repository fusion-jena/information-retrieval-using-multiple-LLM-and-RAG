The text does not provide explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the Urban Green Extraction Dataset (UGE-D) was created to facilitate GVI extraction and train the GVI-learning model. It also refers to several existing datasets like COCO-Stuff, Cityscapes, and ADE20K, which have well-annotated images. These datasets often involve various annotation techniques such as bounding boxes, polygons, or pixel-level masks for object detection, classification, and segmentation tasks. Given that the goal is to extract GVI using semantic segmentation, it can be inferred that the UGE-D dataset likely employs similar annotation techniques, possibly including instance segmentation, to accurately label different types of vegetation or urban elements within the images.
