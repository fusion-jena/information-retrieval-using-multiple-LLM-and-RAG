The deep learning models mentioned in the given context are built using TensorFlow (Abadi et al., 2016). This is explicitly stated when discussing the implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): "The CNNs were implemented using TensorFlow." Additionally, it is noted that the algorithm scripts are available in Supporting Information B, which could potentially provide further details about the specific use of TensorFlow within these models.
