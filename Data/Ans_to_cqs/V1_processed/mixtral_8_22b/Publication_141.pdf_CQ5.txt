The text mentions that the deep learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier was fine-tuned on the ImageNet dataset. However, it is important to note that this dataset does not contain any objects similar to the ones being classified in this study (non-biting midges). Therefore, while ImageNet was used for initial training, the model was further improved through fine-tuning in a second training phase using a custom dataset specific to the study. Unfortunately, the name or details of this custom dataset are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
