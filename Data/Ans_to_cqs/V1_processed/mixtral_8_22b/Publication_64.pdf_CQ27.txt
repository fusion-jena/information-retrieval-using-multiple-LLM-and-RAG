Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to provide a detailed explanation about how the trained deep learning model was deployed. However, based on common practices in machine learning projects, after training the model, it would typically be saved or serialized for later use. This could involve saving the model's architecture and learned weights to disk, often in a specific file format like.h5 for models built with Keras, or.pkl for models built with scikit-learn. Once the model is saved, it can then be loaded and used for making predictions on new data. Regarding platform selection, depending on the application, the model could be deployed on various platforms such as web servers, mobile devices, or edge devices. But without further details, it's impossible to specify which platform was chosen for this particular project.
