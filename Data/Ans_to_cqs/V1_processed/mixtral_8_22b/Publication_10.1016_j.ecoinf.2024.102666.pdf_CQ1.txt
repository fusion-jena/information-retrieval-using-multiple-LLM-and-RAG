The given context does not provide explicit information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions two potential sources of raw data: satellite images and in-situ measured data.

Satellite images are collected using various sensors with different central wavelengths and resolutions. The mentioned sensors include MSI and OLCI, which capture spectral channels such as blue, green, red, vegetation red edge, and near-infrared. These sensors have varying central wavelengths ranging from 490 nm to 783 nm and resolutions between 10 m and 300 m.

In-situ measured data refers to data collected directly from the environment or specific locations. Although the context does not specify how this data is gathered, common methods for collecting in-situ data include field surveys, sensor deployments, and manual measurements.

Based on the given context, we can infer that both remote sensing techniques (satellite images) and direct measurement methods (in-situ data) are employed for gathering raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
