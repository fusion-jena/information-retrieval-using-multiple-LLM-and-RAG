Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it cannot be determined which data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling were applied in this particular study.

However, data augmentation techniques are commonly employed in deep learning pipelines to increase the size of training datasets and improve the performance of models. These techniques include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, zooming, and more. The choice of technique depends on the nature of the dataset and the problem being addressed.

In conclusion, without further information from the authors or additional context, we cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the use of specific data augmentation techniques in this study.
