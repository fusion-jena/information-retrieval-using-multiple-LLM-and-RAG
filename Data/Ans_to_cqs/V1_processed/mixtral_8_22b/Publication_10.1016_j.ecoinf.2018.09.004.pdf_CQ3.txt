The article does not provide information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Instead, it focuses on using machine learning techniques, specifically supervised learning approaches, to examine the presence-absence of seagrass meadows in the Mediterranean Sea. The authors use various datasets and apply different classification algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and K-nearest neighbors, but do not discuss any image-based annotation techniques typically associated with deep learning pipelines.
