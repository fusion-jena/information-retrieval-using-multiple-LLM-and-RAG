The given context does not provide specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is completed, such as validation loss plateau or other metrics. However, it mentions a validation stage involving expert assessment after pre-validation. In this case, the model was reviewed by a group of experts who evaluated the conceptual model and the results of prognostic and diagnostic experiments. This suggests that the completion of training might have been determined based on expert evaluation rather than traditional machine learning metrics like validation loss plateau. Nonetheless, without explicit details regarding the training process and its termination criteria, we cannot definitively state what criteria were used to determine when training was complete.
