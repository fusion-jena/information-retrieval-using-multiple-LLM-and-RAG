The primary metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model is validation accuracy. This metric measures the proportion of correct predictions made by the model out of the total number of instances evaluated. The highest validation accuracy was achieved by Model 12, which has a Deep Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (DeepConvLSTM) architecture, with an accuracy of 0.833 ± 0.005 (mean of years ± sd). Other models with high validation accuracies include Model 19, also with a DeepConvLSTM architecture (accuracy = 0.829 ± 0.003; mean of years ± sd), and Model 14, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture (validation accuracy of 0.821 ± 0.005; mean of years ± sd). Additionally, the Area Under Curve (AUC) is reported for different classes in Table 2, providing further insight into the model's performance across various categories. However, other common evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, or F1 score are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
