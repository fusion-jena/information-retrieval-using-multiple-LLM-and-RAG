The given context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the context that images were used for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is a type of deep learning model commonly used for processing grid-like topologies such as images. Therefore, the data format used in this case would likely be image files, possibly in formats like JPEG or PNG. It should also be noted that CNNs can handle other types of input data, including videos and time series data, but these are not mentioned in the provided context.
