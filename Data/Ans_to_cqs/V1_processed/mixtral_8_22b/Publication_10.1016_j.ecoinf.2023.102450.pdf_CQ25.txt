The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is to automatically monitor the stereotypical behaviors of captive wild animals. Specifically, it uses a Siamese relation network to track the animals in videos and extract their location boxes. This information is then used to obtain the motion trajectories of the animals, which are further segmented into periodic curves. The final step involves classifying these motion trajectory patterns using cross-correlation functions. Additionally, the model provides real-time warning prompts for stereotypical behaviors through a human-computer interaction interface. Therefore, the main goal of this deep learning model is to aid in the automatic recording, storage, and display of motion trajectories, ultimately assisting animal management personnel in monitoring and managing captive wild animals more effectively.
