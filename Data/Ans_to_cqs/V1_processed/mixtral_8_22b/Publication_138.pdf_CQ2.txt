The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the mentioned architectures such as LeNet, AlexNet, GoogLeNet, VGG, and ResNet, we can infer that these models primarily deal with image data. For instance, LeNet was designed for handwritten digit recognition, while AlexNet, GoogLeNet, VGG, and ResNet were developed for large-scale image recognition tasks. Therefore, it can be concluded that the primary data format used in these deep learning pipelines is images.
