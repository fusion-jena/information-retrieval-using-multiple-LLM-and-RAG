The text does not explicitly state the specific criterion used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions using an early stopping criterion, which suggests that the training process might stop based on some form of performance metric or convergence threshold. Given that the Mean Squared Error (MSE) is mentioned as the reference metric, it can be inferred that the early stopping criterion may involve monitoring the MSE on a validation dataset and halting training once the error stops improving significantly or starts increasing, indicating overfitting.
