The provided context does not directly discuss regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, it does mention that Random Forest (RF), a popular machine learning technique, helps overcome limitations of Classification and Regression Trees (CARTs), including model overfitting. This suggests that using ensemble approaches like RF can help mitigate overfitting issues.

In general, regularization methods are employed to reduce overfitting in machine learning and deep learning models. Dropout is a regularization method for neural networks where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent complex co-adaptations on training data. On the other hand, L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, encouraging smaller weights and thus simpler models, reducing the risk of overfitting. These methods are typically applied within the deep learning pipeline to improve model generalization.
