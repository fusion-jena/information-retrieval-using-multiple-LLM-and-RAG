The given context does not provide information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether GPUs, TPUs or any other hardware resources were used for training the model based solely on the provided context.

Based on the given context, it can be understood that the researchers employed an ensemble modeling approach in the BIOMOD2 package in R to predict the distribution of the study species. They used four different models, including regression-based and machine-learning models such as Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). However, there is no mention of the use of deep learning models or the hardware resources used for training them.

Therefore, without additional information, it cannot be determined which hardware resources were used for training the deep learning model.
