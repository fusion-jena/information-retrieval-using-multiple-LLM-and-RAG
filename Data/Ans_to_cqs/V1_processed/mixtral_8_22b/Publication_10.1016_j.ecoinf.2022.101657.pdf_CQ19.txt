The provided context does not explicitly mention which specific frameworks were used to build the deep learning model. However, it discusses various aspects related to deep learning, such as different types of neural networks like Multilayer Perceptron and Convolutional Neural Networks, as well as hardware implementations like Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). It also mentions works by other researchers who have published papers on topics relevant to deep learning and computer vision. Despite these details, there is no direct reference to any particular deep learning framework, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, I cannot determine which frameworks were used to build the deep learning model.
