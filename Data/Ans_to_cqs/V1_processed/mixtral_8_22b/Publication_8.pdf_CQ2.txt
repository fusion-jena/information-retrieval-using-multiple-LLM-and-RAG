Based on the given context, the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images. This is evident from the numerous references to images throughout the text, including phrases like "digitized herbarium sheets," "computer-based image processing techniques," and "Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)," which is specifically designed for processing grid-like topology data such as images. Furthermore, the context mentions studies that have employed deep learning techniques for tasks such as identifying species and higher taxa from images, extracting visual features from images using CNNs, and detecting pathogens in live plant photos. Therefore, it can be concluded that the main data format used in this particular deep learning pipeline is images. However, without additional context, it cannot be determined whether other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV files are also utilized in the overall deep learning process.
