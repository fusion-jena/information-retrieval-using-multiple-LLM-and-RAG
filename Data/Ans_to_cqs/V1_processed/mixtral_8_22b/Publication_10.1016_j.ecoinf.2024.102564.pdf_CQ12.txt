Based on the given information, it appears that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly stated as either a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer. However, we can infer that the model used is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), specifically a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). This is because the text mentions using a trained MLP for modeling net growth in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. Therefore, while it may be tempting to classify MLP under one of the more specific categories like CNN, RNN, or Transformer, it should be noted that these architectures have distinct characteristics and applications. For instance, CNNs are primarily used for image processing tasks, RNNs for sequential data analysis, and Transformers for natural language processing tasks. Since none of these specific use cases are mentioned in the context, it would be safe to conclude that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is an MLP, without further specifying it as any of the other types.
