Unfortunately, there isn't any information available regarding specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context. The text discusses the use of deep learning methods for mapping land cover, particularly woody cover, using aerial images of Kruger National Park (KNP). It mentions the utilization of the "ee.classifier.explain" algorithm for assessing the variable importance of 18 Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) texture metrics. Additionally, the Random Forest classifier is employed along with these GLCM texture metrics and training samples identified with Land Cover (LC) labels. However, no details are provided on the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
