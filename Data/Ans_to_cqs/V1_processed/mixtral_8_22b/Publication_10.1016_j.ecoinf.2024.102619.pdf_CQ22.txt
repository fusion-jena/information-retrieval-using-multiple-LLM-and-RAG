The performance of the deep learning model was evaluated using several metrics. These include accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score. Accuracy indicates the proportion of images that the model classifies correctly. To account for performance within classes, recall, precision, and F1 scores were calculated for each class. Recall, also known as sensitivity, refers to the proportion of images of each class that were correctly classified. Precision, on the other hand, determines the accuracy of the predictions themselves by measuring the proportion of images that were assigned a correct class when classified. The formulas for calculating recall and precision for each habitat class c are given in equations (1) and (2), respectively. The table 6 shows the classifier testing performance with overall test accuracy and class-averaged metrics (recall, precision, and F1 score) for different models.
