Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to determine which specific optimization technique was used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was implemented using the Keras and TensorFlow software packages, both of which support various optimization algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, RMSprop, etc. Therefore, one of these optimization techniques might have been employed during the training process.
