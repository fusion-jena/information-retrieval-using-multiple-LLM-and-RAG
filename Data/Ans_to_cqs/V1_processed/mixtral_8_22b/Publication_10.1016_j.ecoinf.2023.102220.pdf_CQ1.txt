The given context does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses various machine learning methods used for analysis, including Support Vector Machines, Deep Neural Networks, Long Short Term Memory, and Random Forests. In particular, the paper focuses on the Performance Based Prediction (PBP) method, which is shown to be competitive with these other methods. The authors also mention using the LSTM method by adding a long short term memory block on the DNN's architecture. They implemented their classification methods in Python using the libraries TensorFlow and Scikit-learn. Unfortunately, without additional information about the dataset or the research process, I cannot determine the exact methods used for collecting raw data in this deep learning pipeline.
