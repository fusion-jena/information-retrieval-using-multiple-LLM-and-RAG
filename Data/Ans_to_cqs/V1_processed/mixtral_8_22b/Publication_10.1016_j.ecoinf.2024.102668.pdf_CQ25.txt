The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the deep learning model might be used for tasks such as classification or detection. This is suggested by the mention of using consistent feature spaces across studies regardless of the recording device used, which is a common requirement for many deep learning applications. Additionally, the focus on reducing device bias and enhancing the applicability of acoustic indices could indicate that the model aims to improve the accuracy and reliability of predictions made from audio data collected with different recording devices.
