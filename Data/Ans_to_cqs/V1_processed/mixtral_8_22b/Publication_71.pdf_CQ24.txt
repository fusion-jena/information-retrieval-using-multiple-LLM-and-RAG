The table provides various training parameters used in DeepLabV3+, a popular deep learning architecture for semantic segmentation tasks. However, it does not explicitly mention any specific strategy to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. Nevertheless, some common practices to manage randomness include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, employing techniques like cross-validation, and utilizing ensemble models to reduce variance caused by random initialization. These strategies help improve the robustness and reliability of deep learning models.

In summary, while the given context does not directly address the query regarding handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, common practices include setting fixed seeds, using cross-validation, and employing ensemble models.
