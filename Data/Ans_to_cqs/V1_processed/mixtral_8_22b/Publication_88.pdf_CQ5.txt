Based on the given information, the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned. However, there is mention of two databases - Amazon and Cerrado. These could potentially be the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. Unfortunately, without more specific details about these databases or their sources, I cannot confirm if they correspond to well-known datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
