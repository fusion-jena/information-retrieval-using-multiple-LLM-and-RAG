Unfortunately, based on the given information, it is not possible to determine the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. The text does not provide any details regarding the configuration of the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, number of layers, activation functions, etc. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this query with the available information.
