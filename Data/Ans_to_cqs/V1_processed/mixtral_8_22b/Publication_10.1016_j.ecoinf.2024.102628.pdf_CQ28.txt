The text does not explicitly mention which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the fast.ai platform was used to train and validate the models. Fast.ai is a deep learning library built on top of PyTorch, providing high-level components that can quickly and easily provide state-of-the-art results in standard deep learning domains, and provides researchers with high-level components that can be combined together in order to innovate and create new approaches. Therefore, while the deployment platform isn't specified, the development and validation process took place within the fast.ai environment.
