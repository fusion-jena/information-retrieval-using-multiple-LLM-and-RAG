The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, based on the information available, it can be inferred that the Random Forest model, which is a type of machine learning method, is being used for classification purposes. Specifically, this model is employed to classify pixels into either the presence or absence of seagrass meadows. This is evident from the statement, "Two sets of RF models were performed using the multispectral images retrieved in 2010. In the first set, the response variable was the presence/absence of the total seagrass meadows." Therefore, the primary objective of this model appears to be the classification of seagrass meadow coverage.
