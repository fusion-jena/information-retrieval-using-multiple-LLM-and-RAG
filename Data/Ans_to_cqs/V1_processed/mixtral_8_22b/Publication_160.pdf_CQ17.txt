The text does not explicitly mention specific regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, it discusses how the choice of patch size can help with preventing overfitting by including enough contextual noise. Specifically, a patch size of 224 x 224 pixels was found to give the highest micro-F1 score on the test set, as it included enough contextual noise to regularize overfitting and enable better generalization. Additionally, the text mentions that combining a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with other machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression (LR) can also improve classification accuracy and help prevent overfitting.
