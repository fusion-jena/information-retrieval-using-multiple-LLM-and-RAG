The text does not provide information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or using random seed values. However, some common strategies used to manage randomness include setting fixed random seeds, using deterministic algorithms, and employing ensemble methods. These techniques help ensure reproducibility and consistency in results across different runs of the same model.

Based on the given context, it can be observed that the PLUS model utilizes a combination of the transformed specification mining framework based on the Land Expansion Analysis Strategy (LEAS) module and the Cellular Automata (CA) model based on a Multi-Type Random Patch Seed Mechanism (CARS). The LEAS module employs the random forest algorithm to calculate development probabilities for various land use types using two time periods of land use data. This methodology is deemed superior to the FLUS model, which relies on an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with only one period of land use data. Furthermore, the PLUS model introduces a decreasing threshold rule for generating patch seeds, gradually restricting patch growth for diverse land use categories via an iterative process.

However, there is no explicit mention of how this model handles randomness within its deep learning pipeline or any specific reference to managing random seed values. Therefore, while general strategies such as setting fixed random seeds, utilizing deterministic algorithms, and applying ensemble methods could potentially be applied to improve the robustness and reliability of the PLUS model, further research would be required to confirm their applicability in this particular case.
