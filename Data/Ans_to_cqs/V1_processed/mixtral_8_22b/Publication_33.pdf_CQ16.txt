The text does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, based on common practices in machine learning, some possible criteria could be:

1. Validation Loss Plateau: Training can be stopped when the validation loss stops decreasing or starts increasing, indicating overfitting. This is often referred to as early stopping.

2. Maximum Number of Epochs: Training can also be stopped after a certain number of epochs have been completed. An epoch refers to one full pass through the entire training dataset.

3. Time Constraints: Sometimes, training might be stopped due to time constraints, especially if the model takes too long to train.

4. Performance Metrics: Training can be stopped once the desired performance metrics (like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score etc.) have been achieved.

However, these are speculations based on general practices and may not necessarily apply to the described methodology.
