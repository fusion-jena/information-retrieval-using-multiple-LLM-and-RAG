The given context does not provide explicit information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that preprocessing the input instead of relying on data augmentation is a preferred way with significantly better results. This suggests that the authors might have focused on improving the quality of the original dataset rather than generating new samples through data augmentation techniques like rotation, scaling, or flipping.

Moreover, the context discusses the use of a fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and compares its performance with traditional classification methods such as SVM, k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and Sparse Representation Classifier. These methods often require labeled data for training, implying that some form of data annotation was likely used. However, the exact technique (bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, etc.) remains unspecified in the provided context.

Additionally, the context refers to studies that achieved high classification rates on fish datasets using CNNs. While these studies do not directly mention the data annotation techniques employed, they suggest that the datasets may have included labeled images of individual fish species, possibly involving object detection or semantic segmentation techniques during the annotation process.

In conclusion, although the given context does not explicitly state the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it implies that some form of labeling was involved due to the use of supervised machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, the preference for preprocessing the input over data augmentation indicates a potential emphasis on enhancing the original dataset's quality.
