The paper does not provide information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that the primary hyperparameter settings of the three detection models are listed in Table 2, but it does not specify where these models or their corresponding datasets can be accessed. Therefore, without additional context or information, it is impossible to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is located.
