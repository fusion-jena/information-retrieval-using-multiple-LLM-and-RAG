The information provided does not explicitly mention where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline for BirdNET is available. However, it is common practice for academic projects like this one to share their code on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. To find the specific location of the BirdNET code repository, I recommend visiting the official websites of The Cornell Lab of Ornithology or Chemnitz University of Technology, searching for relevant publications related to BirdNET, or directly contacting the authors mentioned in the given context.
