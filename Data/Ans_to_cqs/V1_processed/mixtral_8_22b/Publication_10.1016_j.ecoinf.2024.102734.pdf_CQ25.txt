The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, it can be inferred that the model is being used for classification purposes. This is because the text mentions comparing three classification models - ResNet-50, Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST), and HuBERT. These models are known for their use in image and audio classification tasks. Furthermore, the context discusses evaluating the model using a test dataset containing both positive and negative examples, which is a common practice in classification tasks. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model is likely being used for classification purposes within the context of computational bioacoustics.
