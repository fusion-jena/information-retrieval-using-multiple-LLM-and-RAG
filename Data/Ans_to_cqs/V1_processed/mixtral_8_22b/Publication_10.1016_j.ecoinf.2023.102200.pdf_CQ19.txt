The papers cited do not explicitly mention which specific deep learning frameworks were used to build their models. However, they do provide some information about the types of deep learning architectures employed. For instance, Yin and Wang (2019) utilized traditional MCWS and RG algorithms for segmenting individual mangrove trees based on a LiDAR-derived CHM. On the other hand, Jin et al. (2018) used three-dimensional CNNs to segment individual plants in maize plots using ground-based LiDAR data. Lastly, Wang et al. (2019a) implemented the R-CNN method for individual rubber tree segmentation based on ground-based light detection and ranging data. These methods suggest that popular deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch could have been used, but without explicit confirmation from the authors, it remains speculative.
