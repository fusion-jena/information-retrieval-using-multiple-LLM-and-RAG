Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved to ensure the data is suitable for training. These may include:

1. Normalization or Standardization: This involves transforming the data so that it has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. This can help improve the performance of the model by making the optimization process more stable.

2. Scaling: This involves rescaling the data to a specific range, such as between 0 and 1. This can be useful when dealing with features that have different scales, as it ensures that all features contribute equally to the final output.

3. Cleaning: This involves removing any irrelevant or incorrect data points from the dataset. This could include missing values, outliers, or duplicates. Cleaning the data can help improve the accuracy of the model.

4. Feature Selection or Engineering: This involves selecting the most relevant features for the task at hand, or creating new features based on existing ones. This can help reduce overfitting and improve the interpretability of the model.

5. Splitting the Dataset: This involves dividing the dataset into a training set, validation set, and test set. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the test set is used to evaluate the final performance of the model.
