The text does not provide specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of high spatial and ultra-high resolution remote sensing data, which suggests that satellite imagery or drone footage could be one source of raw data collection. Additionally, the research may have involved gathering data from existing databases or conducting field surveys to collect relevant information.

Based on the given context, we can infer that various methods might have been employed for collecting raw data, such as:

1. Remote Sensing Data: High spatial and ultra-high resolution remote sensing data were mentioned, indicating that satellite imagery or drone footage was likely used to gather visual data related to land use and forest types.

2. Public Datasets: Existing databases containing historical records, geographical information, or environmental data could have been accessed to supplement the collected data.

3. Field Surveys: Researchers may have conducted ground surveys to validate their findings, observe local conditions, and gather additional data points.

However, without explicit mention of these methods in the provided context, this response remains speculative.
