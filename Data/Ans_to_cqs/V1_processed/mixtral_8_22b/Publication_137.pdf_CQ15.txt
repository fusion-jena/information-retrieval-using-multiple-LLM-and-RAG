Based on the given information, there isn't any explicit mention of specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does state that they use a deep neural network for processing data and adjust the training epoch, batch size, and volume size to output a classifier for prediction. This implies that some form of optimization technique would likely be employed during this process, but without further details, it cannot be definitively stated which one was used.
