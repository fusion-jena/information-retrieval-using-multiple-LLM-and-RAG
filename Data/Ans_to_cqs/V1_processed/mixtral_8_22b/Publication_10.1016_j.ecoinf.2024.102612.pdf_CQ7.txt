The given context does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into sets like train, test, and validation. However, based on common practices in machine learning and deep learning, we can assume that the data might have been divided randomly into three subsets: training set, validation set, and testing set. Typically, the training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set is utilized to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting during the training process. Lastly, the testing set is applied to evaluate the final model's performance. It should also be noted that the proportion of splitting the data depends on various factors, including the size of the dataset, computational resources, and specific requirements of the project.
