Based on the given context, it is not possible to determine what specific optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), since there is no mention of these techniques in the provided information. However, we can see that the paper discusses the use of a Random Forest (RF) model, which is a type of ensemble learning method rather than a deep learning technique. Therefore, it does not directly involve optimization techniques like SGD or Adam. Instead, the RF model uses bootstrap aggregating (bagging) and feature randomness when building each individual decision tree within the forest.
