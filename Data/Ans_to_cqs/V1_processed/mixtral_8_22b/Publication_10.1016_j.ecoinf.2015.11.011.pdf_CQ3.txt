The text does not provide information about specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it mentions that segmentation and classification strategies in eCognition are rapidly evolving, including the use of machine learning techniques for automatic image classification. The authors also mention using multi-resolution segmentation with a large scale parameter to mask forest and prairie from each other, and multi-threshold segmentation on various bands to classify within those areas. Additionally, they note that even with machine learning, some supervision and validation using aerial photo interpretation techniques or other data sources are still necessary.
