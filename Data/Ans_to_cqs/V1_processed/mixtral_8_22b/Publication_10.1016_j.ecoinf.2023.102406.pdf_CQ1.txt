The given context does not explicitly mention any specific method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. However, it discusses the process of'sample thinning,' which could imply that some form of sampling was employed to gather the initial dataset. This technique involves removing certain samples from the dataset without significantly affecting the overall model performance, accuracy, or variable importance. In this case, the study suggests that sample thinning did not have much impact on these factors, implying that the original dataset might have been robust enough to handle such reductions. Therefore, while we cannot definitively state what method was used to collect the raw data based solely on the provided context, we can infer that some form of sampling was likely involved.
