The deep learning model described in the given context is primarily designed for the task of classification. Specifically, it aims to classify fish events based on the latent representations extracted from an autoencoder model. This is evident from the statement, "Once the latent representations were extracted from the Autoencoder model, an MLP was trained for the classification of fish events." Furthermore, the architecture of the MLP supports this claim, as it comprises four fully connected layers with the final layer having 12 neurons, each corresponding to one of the events. The maximum neuron value from this layer is then used for predicting the event class.
