The text does not provide explicit details about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model like MegaDetector. However, it can be inferred that the dataset used for training consists of various images collected from diverse ecosystems. Preprocessing steps typically involve preparing the input data so that it can be effectively processed by the model. Common preprocessing techniques include normalization, scaling, cleaning, augmentation, and labeling. Normalization scales pixel values to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, while scaling resizes images to fit the required dimensions. Cleaning involves removing irrelevant or redundant data, and augmentation generates additional training samples through transformations like rotation, flipping, or cropping. Labeling entails associating each image with its corresponding ground truth class, which in this case would be 'animal', 'human', or 'truck'. Although the exact preprocessing steps applied to train MegaDetector are not mentioned, it is reasonable to assume that standard practices were followed based on the high accuracy reported in the evaluation.
