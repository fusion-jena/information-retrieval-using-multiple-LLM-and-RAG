Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer that semantic segmentation was employed as part of the research study. Semantic segmentation is a type of pixel-level classification task where each pixel in an image is assigned a label corresponding to the object or region it belongs to. It differs from other annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation and instance segmentation.

Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects within an image, which helps localize and identify those objects. Instance segmentation goes further by outlining individual instances of objects within an image, allowing for precise identification and differentiation between overlapping or closely situated objects.

In contrast, semantic segmentation focuses on identifying regions rather than individual instances, grouping together pixels belonging to the same category without distinguishing between separate entities. Given the focus on separating tree-covered areas in the Cerrado urban environment, it appears that semantic segmentation was the primary annotation technique utilized in this study.
