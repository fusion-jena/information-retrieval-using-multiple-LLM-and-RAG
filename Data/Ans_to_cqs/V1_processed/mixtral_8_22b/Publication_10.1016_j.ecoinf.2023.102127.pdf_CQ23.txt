The text does not provide explicit information on specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, it discusses challenges related to model evaluation and validation when integrating multiple datasets due to potential biases and differences in sampling methods. It suggests that using prior knowledge about a species' biology could help improve predictions by guiding response functions toward more realistic outcomes.

Regarding the issue of limited data availability for fitting complex models like those used in machine learning, the text mentions that the package will raise warnings if insufficient information is provided for inferring a species distribution. This implies that care should be taken to gather diverse and representative datasets to support reliable model development and evaluation.

While the text does not directly address techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting, these strategies are commonly employed to enhance the robustness and generalizability of machine learning models. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into subsets and iteratively training the model on different combinations of them, which helps prevent overfitting and provides insights into how well the model performs on unseen data. Stratified splitting ensures that each subset maintains the original class proportions, further improving the model's ability to generalize across various scenarios.
