In the given context, the performance of the deep learning model, specifically Stacked AutoEncoder (SAE), is evaluated against a traditional machine learning method, Support Vector Machine (SVM). Four different metrics are used to assess their performance: Producer's Accuracy (PA), User's Accuracy (UA), Overall Accuracy (OA), and Kappa Statistic (KS). These metrics help determine the effectiveness of each method in accurately identifying and classifying Spartina alterniflora, an invasive species, within Landsat images. While specific details about how these metrics are calculated are not provided in the context, they generally serve as indicators of classification accuracy and agreement between predicted and actual classes.
