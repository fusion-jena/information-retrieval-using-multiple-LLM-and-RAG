Unfortunately, I cannot provide a direct answer to your query since the given information does not include any details about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used by C.D. Jolliffe and their team. It appears that the authors have only mentioned the roles each author played in writing, supervising, validating, and conceptualizing the research but did not share specific links or references to the code repositories they utilized. Therefore, it would be best to contact the corresponding author directly or check the full text of the paper for more detailed information regarding the code repository link.
