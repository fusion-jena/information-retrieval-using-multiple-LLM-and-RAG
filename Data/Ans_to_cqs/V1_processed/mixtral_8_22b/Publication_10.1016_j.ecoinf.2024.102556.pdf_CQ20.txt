The text mentions that the Jetson AGX Xavier-embedded computing system from NVIDIA was utilized for image processing. This system features an NVIDIA Volta GPU with 512 CUDA cores and an 8-core ARMv8.2 CPU. Therefore, we can infer that the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model include an NVIDIA Volta GPU and an 8-core ARMv8.2 CPU.
