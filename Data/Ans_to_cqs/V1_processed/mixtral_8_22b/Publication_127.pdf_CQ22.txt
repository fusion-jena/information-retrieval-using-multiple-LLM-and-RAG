In Table 2, the metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models is Top-1 accuracy. Top-1 accuracy measures the percentage of correct predictions where the predicted label matches exactly with the true label. It does not consider any partial credit for close guesses. Other common evaluation metrics include precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), but these were not mentioned in the given context.
