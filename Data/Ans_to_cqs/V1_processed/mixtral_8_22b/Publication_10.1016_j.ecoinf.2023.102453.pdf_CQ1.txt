The text does not explicitly mention specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, there are some indications about potential sources of data. For instance, the phrase "large scale ecological studies" suggests that data might be collected through fieldwork or observations in natural environments. Additionally, the reference to "camera traps" implies that these devices could be employed to gather visual data automatically. Furthermore, the paper by Shahinfar et al. (2020) discusses the impact of sample size on deep learning model performance, which may indicate that they used a dataset composed of multiple images. Lastly, the study by Sim√µes et al. (2023) focuses on wildlife identification and localization using deep learning on camera trap videos, suggesting that video footage could serve as another source of data. Therefore, while the exact methods for gathering raw data are not specified, it appears that various approaches such as fieldwork, camera traps, and publicly available datasets could potentially be utilized in this context.
