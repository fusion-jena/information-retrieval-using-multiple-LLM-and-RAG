In the given context, the dataset is divided into three sets: training, validation, and testing. The training set comprises the majority of the data (82%) and contains 4000 images. This set is used to train the model and adjust its parameters, enabling it to learn from various examples and patterns within the data.

The validation set consists of 13% of the total data, or 607 images. During training, this set helps fine-tune hyperparameters and assess the model's performance on unseen data. Using a validation set prevents overfitting and ensures better generalization.

Lastly, the testing set accounts for 5% of the data, including 260 images. This set serves as an independent evaluation of the model's performance on completely unseen data, offering a reliable measure of its effectiveness and ability to generalize in real-world scenarios.

Therefore, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training include allocating most of the data for training purposes, reserving a smaller portion for validating the model during training, and using another small subset for final testing and evaluation.
