The given context does not provide explicit information about specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the context that various data sources have been utilized for different purposes. For instance, the work of Mohedano et al. (2017) focuses on object retrieval using deep convolutional networks, but no specific dataset is mentioned. Similarly, Cohen and Shashua (2017) discuss the inductive bias of deep convolutional networks without specifying any particular dataset.

In terms of geographical data, several sources have been employed. These include the Archaeological Survey of Israel maps for Amazya (109) and Lakhish (98) (Dagan, 2006), orthophotos from the Survey of Israel (S.O.I, 2018), and the Geospatial Portal of the Survey of Israel (S.O.I, 2024). Additionally, soil maps (Ravikovitch, 1969) and historical maps from the Survey of Palestine (S.O.P, 1945; S.O.P, 1947) were also used.

For vegetation and floral data, resources like Danin and Fragman-Sapir (2016)'s Flora of Israel website and Danin and Orshan (1999)'s Vegetation of Israel volume were consulted. Furthermore, land cover classification systems (Di Gregorio & Jansen, 2005) and QGIS software (QGIS, 2023) were likely used for processing and analyzing spatial data.

Overall, while there is no direct mention of popular deep learning datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, the context suggests that various geographical, archaeological, and ecological data sources were incorporated into the research process.
