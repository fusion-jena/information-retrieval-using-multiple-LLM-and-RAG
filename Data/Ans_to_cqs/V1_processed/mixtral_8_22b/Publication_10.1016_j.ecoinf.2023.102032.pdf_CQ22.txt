The given context does not provide information on the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model for calculating Wetland Use Intensity using Earth Observation data from Sentinel-2 satellites. However, common metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of total predictions made by the model. Precision is the ratio of true positive predictions to all positive predictions made by the model. Recall is the ratio of true positive predictions to all actual positives in the dataset. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both precision and recall. It is important to note that the choice of evaluation metrics depends on the problem domain and the desired trade-off between false positives and false negatives.
