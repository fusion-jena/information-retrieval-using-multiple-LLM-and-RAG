The text does not provide specific information about the exact datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the study uses large image datasets to train deep neural networks like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Furthermore, the authors state that they split their dataset into three parts - training, validation, and testing sets - with a ratio of 80:10:10, respectively. They also mention that the input resolutions of the images are either 640 x 640 pixels or 1280 x 1280 pixels. Unfortunately, without more detailed information, I cannot specify the exact datasets used in this particular deep learning pipeline.
