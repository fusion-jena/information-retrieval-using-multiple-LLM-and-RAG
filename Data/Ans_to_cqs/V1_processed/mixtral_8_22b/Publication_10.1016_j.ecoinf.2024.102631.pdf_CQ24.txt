The given context does not provide any direct information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline such as managing random seed values. However, it discusses various aspects of a deep learning model architecture, including its use of structures with an increasing number of output channels, integration of Spatial and Channel Attention (SCA) modules, and application of different loss functions like adversarial loss, L1 loss, and perceptual loss.

To manage randomness in the deep learning pipeline, common strategies include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, employing techniques like cross-validation, bootstrapping, or bagging to reduce variance, and using dropout regularization during training to prevent overfitting due to randomness. Nevertheless, without explicit mention in the provided context, one cannot definitively state what specific strategies are being utilized in this case.
