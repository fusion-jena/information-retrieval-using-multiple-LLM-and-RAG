The text does not provide information on the use of any specific deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers in the pipeline. Instead, it mentions the application of various machine learning techniques like General Linear Models, Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), and Random Forests for classification tasks. Therefore, based on the given context, we cannot determine what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline.
