The deep learning model in this study is used for the classification of pollen images. The model is trained on a large dataset consisting of 35,573 images for each of the 12 channels, covering 35 species and resulting in a total of 426,876 images. This dataset is split into three sets for training, validation, and testing in the proportions 80 : 10 : 10. The images in the training set are augmented using various techniques such as flipping horizontally and vertically, adjusting brightness, saturation, contrast, and hue to gain a more robust and better generalizing classifier.

The model used for this classification task is a convolutional neural network (CNN) with an inception network architecture (INCEPTION v.3) that has 48 convolution layers. This architecture was the first to beat a human performing the same classification task in the prestigious ImageNet competition in 2015. Transfer learning is used to train the classifiers, where a network pre-trained on the large-scale ImageNet ILSVRC 2012 dataset is utilized.

The study found that a minimum of 200 images per species is required for accurate species identification of phytoplankton. However, the present study on pollen showed that five out of six species with fewer than 200 pollen grains were classified with an accuracy higher than 90%. Based on these findings, the study concluded that between 50 and 100 pollen grains represented a reasonable amount of pollen images on a single channel to be included in the reference library.

Therefore, the deep learning model in this study is specifically designed for the classification of pollen images, using a large dataset and transfer learning to improve the model's accuracy.
