The deep learning pipeline can use various data formats, including image, audio, video, and CSV files, depending on the specific application. However, the provided context focuses on the use of time-series GPS data in a deep learning model for predicting seabird diving behavior.

In this study, the GPS track data is in the form of CSV files, which are available on the seabird tracking website (<http://seabirdtracking.org/mapper/contributor.php?contributor_id=950>). These CSV files contain x and y values representing the geographical locations of seabirds at different time points.

The deep learning model is built using these GPS location data points as input features. The model is then used to predict the binary dependent variable, dive/not dive, based on the input features.

Although the context does not explicitly mention other data formats like images, audio, or video, deep learning models can handle these formats as well. For instance, deep learning has been successfully applied in image recognition, speech recognition, and audio processing, using pixel arrays, spectrograms, or waveform data as input features.

In summary, the provided context focuses on the use of CSV files containing GPS location data in a deep learning pipeline for predicting seabird diving behavior. However, deep learning models can work with various data formats, including images, audio, video, and CSV files, depending on the specific application.
