The provided context does not contain specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model for object retrieval presented in the Mohedano et al. (2017) paper. The paper focuses on the application of deep convolutional neural networks for object retrieval and the comparison of their performance with other methods. However, it does not offer explicit details about the hyperparameters of their deep learning model.

Hyperparameters in deep learning models are crucial for the optimization and performance of the model. Commonly used hyperparameters include learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, optimizer, and regularization techniques. These hyperparameters need to be carefully chosen and tuned to achieve optimal performance.

In summary, the context provided does not contain information on the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model presented in the Mohedano et al. (2017) paper.
