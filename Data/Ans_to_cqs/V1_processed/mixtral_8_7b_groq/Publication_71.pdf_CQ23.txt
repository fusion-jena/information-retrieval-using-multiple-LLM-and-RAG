Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, there are some implicit indications that suggest that the authors might have taken some steps to improve the model's generalizability.

Firstly, the authors mentioned that they used a "large-scale" dataset, which implies that they might have included a diverse range of images from different sources, locations, and conditions. This can help the model to learn various patterns and features, which can improve its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

Secondly, the authors used a pre-trained model, DeepLabV3+, which was originally designed for RGB images and then adjusted it to accommodate four-channel input images, including a NIR band. This approach can be seen as a form of transfer learning, where the model learns the weights for the new image bands while initializing the weights for the RGB input channels with pre-trained model weights. This can help the model to learn more robust features and improve its generalizability.

Thirdly, the authors used a "slow start" learning rate strategy, where the learning rate was gradually increased from a small value to the base learning rate during the first few steps of training. This can help the model to converge more smoothly and avoid getting stuck in local minima, which can improve its ability to generalize.

Lastly, the authors used a "poly" learning policy, where the learning rate was decreased according to a polynomial function of the training step. This can help the model to fine-tune the weights during the later stages of training and avoid overfitting, which can improve its generalizability.

Therefore, while there is no explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the authors might have taken some implicit steps, such as using a diverse dataset, transfer learning, slow start learning rate, and poly learning policy, to improve the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.
