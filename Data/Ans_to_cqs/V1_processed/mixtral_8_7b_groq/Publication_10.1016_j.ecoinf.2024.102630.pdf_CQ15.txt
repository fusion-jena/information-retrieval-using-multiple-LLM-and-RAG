The provided context does not give information about the optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. The context focuses on the use of the Jenks natural breaks optimization method in the classification analysis of NDVI data in remote sensing. This method is used to determine the optimal classification by maximizing the variance between classes and minimizing the variance within classes, thereby identifying natural groupings in the data. However, it does not pertain to optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines.
