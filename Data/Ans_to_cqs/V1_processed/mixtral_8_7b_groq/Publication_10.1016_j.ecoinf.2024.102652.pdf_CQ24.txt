The provided text discusses a deep learning pipeline for assessing and segmenting salt-affected soils using remote sensing and a modified deep learning MU-NET convolutional neural network. However, it does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value.

In general, deep learning models often involve randomness during various stages, such as weight initialization, data shuffling, and dropout regularization. A common practice to handle randomness is to set a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility of the results. This is particularly important for scientific research, where the ability to replicate and validate results is crucial.

In the context of the given text, the authors mention using a batch size of 32 during training, which involves random data shuffling. However, they do not explicitly specify whether they used a fixed seed value for data shuffling or any other stage of the deep learning pipeline.

To address randomness more systematically, deep learning practitioners can adopt several strategies, such as:

1. Fixed random seed value: Set a fixed seed value for random number generators used in the deep learning pipeline, ensuring consistent results across multiple runs.
2. Multiple runs: Perform multiple runs with different random seed values to assess the robustness and variability of the model's performance.
3. Cross-validation: Use cross-validation techniques to assess the model's performance and reduce the impact of randomness on the evaluation metric.

While the provided text does not explicitly mention these strategies, it is still valuable for understanding the overall deep learning pipeline for soil salinity assessment. Researchers and practitioners should be aware of the importance of handling randomness in deep learning pipelines and consider implementing strategies like those mentioned above.
