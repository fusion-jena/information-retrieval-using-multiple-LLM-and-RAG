Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of specific postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps or Confusion matrix after model training. However, it does mention that the model's performance was evaluated using the Area Under the receiver-operator Curve (AUC) and True Skill Statistics (TSS). 

The AUC measures the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes, while the TSS provides a measure of the model's performance that is independent of the threshold used. These are two common metrics used to assess the model's performance in species distribution model studies.

It is also mentioned that percentages were computed for each habitat feature and number of encountered specimens. These calculations could be considered as part of the postprocessing steps as they provide additional insights into the model's predictions.

In summary, based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after model training include the calculation of AUC and TSS, and the computation of percentages for each habitat feature and number of encountered specimens.
