The generalizability of a deep learning model refers to its ability to perform well on unseen data. Several measures were taken in the study to ensure the model's generalizability, including the use of a diverse dataset, pre-trained models, and evaluation metrics such as precision and recall.

Firstly, the training data was preprocessed to ensure that the input images were equally sized. A time-frequency input window size of 2 seconds was chosen as it is close to the mean and median template duration across target call types. This window size was chosen to accommodate most call types, which have a duration below 1 second, and those above 2 seconds were truncated. While some information may be lost in the truncation, the study prioritized having a consistent input size for the model.

Secondly, the study used a pre-trained ResNet50 model, which was initially trained on the ImageNet dataset, containing over one million photo images across 1000 classes. Although ImageNet does not contain spectrograms, models pre-trained with the dataset learn a variety of image features that have been successfully tuned to spectrogram classification previously. This approach takes advantage of the transfer learning capability of deep learning models, where a model already optimized for a similar dataset is fine-tuned with new data.

Thirdly, the study used evaluation metrics such as precision and recall to quantify the model's performance. Precision measures the fraction of predictions of presence that are correct, while recall, also known as sensitivity or true-positive rate, measures the fraction of presences that are correctly identified. These metrics provide a better understanding of the model's performance than relying solely on accuracy, especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets.

However, the study does not explicitly mention techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting to further ensure the model's generalizability. Cross-validation is a technique used to assess how well a model will generalize to an independent dataset by dividing the dataset into k-folds, training the model on k-1 folds, and testing it on the remaining fold. Stratified splitting is a technique used to ensure that each fold contains a representative proportion of each class when splitting the data into training and testing sets.

In summary, the study took several measures to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, including preprocessing the training data, using a pre-trained model, and evaluating the model's performance using precision and recall. However, techniques such as cross-validation and stratified splitting were not explicitly mentioned in the study.
