The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of precision and recall metrics at a selected prediction threshold of 0.99. The mean precision and recall across species were 0.90 and 0.71, respectively. However, the total precision and recall were 0.98 and 0.83, demonstrating that model performance is correlated with the frequency of species presence. This association between performance and frequency of presence could be due to the slight correlation between species frequency and training sample size.

Additionally, the study achieved strong performance for some species with a small sample size, indicating that the model's robustness to noise is crucial for rarer species with relatively few presences. The model's performance was also evaluated based on the balance between presences and absences, with rarer species requiring stronger robustness to noise to achieve a low false positive rate (FPR) and high precision.

The training data preprocessing strategy involved using a time-frequency input window size of 2 seconds for the CNN model, which was chosen based on the mean and median template duration across target call types. Most call types have a duration below 1 second, and for those above 2 seconds, the study found that species-specific performance did not have a clear association with training sample size.

The study collected most recordings in 2019 (78%), 2018 (11%), and between 2015 and 2018 (11%). Most recordings were collected in the months of March and April, a period of high acoustic activity. The study also collected recordings from other sites and older years to increase the training sample size for certain species.

In summary, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of precision and recall metrics at a selected prediction threshold of 0.99, evaluating the balance between presences and absences, and ensuring the model's robustness to noise for rarer species. The training data preprocessing strategy involves using a time-frequency input window size of 2 seconds, and collecting recordings from other sites and older years to increase the training sample size for certain species.
