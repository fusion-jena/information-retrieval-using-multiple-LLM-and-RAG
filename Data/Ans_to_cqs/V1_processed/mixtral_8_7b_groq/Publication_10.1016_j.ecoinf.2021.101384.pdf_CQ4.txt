Based on the provided context, there is no mention of specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling being applied in the described workflow. The context discusses the use of a workflow that implements a FAIR approach, processes vessel tracking data from satellite and AIS systems, and combines it with global, high-quality, environmental, biodiversity, and fishery data. The workflow is open-source and integrates with the DataMiner Cloud computing platform of the D4Science e-Infrastructure.

The context does mention that the workflow uses data classification and spatio-temporal aggregation to compensate for certain biases and that the precision of the workflow's output depends on the completeness of the input vessel data, the update rate of the GRSF, the completeness of the OBIS data in the selected time range, and the suitability of the selected spatial resolution for the analysis. However, it does not mention any data augmentation techniques being applied in the deep learning pipeline.
