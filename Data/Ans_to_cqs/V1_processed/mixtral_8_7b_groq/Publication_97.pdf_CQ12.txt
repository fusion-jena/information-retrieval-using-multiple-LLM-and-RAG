The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is specified in the context provided, where it mentions that the U-Net-like CNN was implemented using the Keras framework, which is a popular deep learning library primarily used for building CNNs. Additionally, the context also mentions that the model was trained on satellite images, which are typically processed using CNNs in computer vision tasks.
