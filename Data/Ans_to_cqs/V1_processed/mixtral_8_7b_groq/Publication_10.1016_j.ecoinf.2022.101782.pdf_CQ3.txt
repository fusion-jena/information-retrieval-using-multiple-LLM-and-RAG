The provided context does not give specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the study used social media data documenting and recording sightings of birds, specifically red kites. It can be inferred that some form of annotation was used to identify and label red kite sightings in the data.

The deep learning pipeline involved training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a dataset of red kite images. The training set was passed over multiple times, and image augmentation techniques such as horizontal flipping, shearing, and random zooming were applied to increase the diversity of the training data. The pixels were normalized to ImageNet mean values and rescaled in the range of [0, 1]. The best model was selected based on minimal validation loss.

However, the context does not mention whether bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, or any other specific annotation techniques were used. Bounding box annotation involves drawing a box around the object of interest in an image, while instance segmentation involves separating the object from the background and other objects in the image. These techniques can be useful for training CNNs to detect and classify objects in images.

Therefore, while the context provides some information about the data and deep learning pipeline used in the study, it does not give specific details about the data annotation techniques employed.
