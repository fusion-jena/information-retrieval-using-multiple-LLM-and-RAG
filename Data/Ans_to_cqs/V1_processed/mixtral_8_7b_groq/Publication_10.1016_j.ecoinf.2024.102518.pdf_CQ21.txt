Based on the provided context, there are several postprocessing steps that were taken after the model training, although the specific terms like "saliency maps" or "confusion matrix" are not explicitly mentioned. Here are the postprocessing steps that can be inferred from the context:

1. **Feature Class Selection:** The first step involved selecting the optimal feature class from the options 'L', 'Q', 'LQ', 'LQP', and 'P'. The feature class 'LQP' was identified as the best option.

2. **Regularization Multiplier Determination:** After selecting the feature class, the regularization multiplier was set from 0.5 to 5. The optimal value of 3.5 was determined based on the delta.AICc metric.

3. **Model Validation and Metrics Calculation:** The performance of the model was evaluated using the Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) and the Continuous Boyce Index (CBI). The mean AUC-ROC stood at 95.5%, and the average CBI index for the validation dataset was 82.6%.

4. **Habitat Suitability Classification:** The final step involved classifying the habitat suitability into four categories: highly suitable, suitable, marginally suitable, and not suitable. The percentage of highly suitable habitat within the domestic study region was calculated.

So, while the context does not explicitly mention terms like "saliency maps" or "confusion matrix", it does mention the calculation of metrics like AUC-ROC and CBI, and the classification of habitat suitability.
