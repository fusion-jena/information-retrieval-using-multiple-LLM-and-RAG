The deep learning pipeline described in the context employs the ADAM optimization technique. This information is provided in the first section, where it is mentioned that ADAM optimisation with a learning rate of 0.0001 is used to find the optimal weights in the neural network. ADAM, which stands for Adaptive Moment Estimation, is a popular optimization algorithm used in machine learning and deep learning. It is an extension of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method, which is another optimization technique commonly used in deep learning. ADAM combines the advantages of two other optimization methods: AdaGrad, which handles sparse gradients well, and RMSProp, which works well with online and non-stationary objectives. ADAM is known for its efficiency, effectiveness, and ease of use, making it a popular choice for optimizing deep learning models.
