Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for estimating aquatic ecosystem health. However, I can provide some general information about common data annotation techniques used in deep learning.

In computer vision and image processing tasks, data annotation techniques are crucial for training deep learning models. These techniques help in labeling the data, so the model can learn to identify and classify different objects or regions of interest in an image. Some common data annotation techniques include:

1. Image-level classification: In this technique, an image is labeled with a single class or category. For example, an image of a water body can be labeled as 'polluted' or 'clean'.
2. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing a bounding box around an object of interest in an image. It helps the model to learn the spatial location and size of the object. For instance, in aquatic ecosystem health estimation, bounding boxes can be used to annotate different types of aquatic plants or animals.
3. Semantic segmentation: In semantic segmentation, each pixel in an image is assigned a class label. It helps the model to learn the spatial distribution of different classes within an image. For example, it can be used to differentiate between different types of aquatic plants or sediments in a water body image.
4. Instance segmentation: This technique is an extension of semantic segmentation, where each instance of an object is segmented and labeled individually. It helps the model to learn the number and spatial distribution of different instances of an object in an image.

In the context of estimating aquatic ecosystem health using deep learning, data annotation techniques like image-level classification, bounding box annotation, and semantic or instance segmentation can be used depending on the specific requirements of the task. For instance, if the goal is to estimate the presence or absence of a particular type of aquatic plant or animal, image-level classification can be used. On the other hand, if the goal is to estimate the spatial distribution of different types of aquatic plants or sediments, semantic or instance segmentation can be more appropriate.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for estimating aquatic ecosystem health, common data annotation techniques in deep learning include image-level classification, bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. The choice of data annotation technique depends on the specific requirements of the task.
