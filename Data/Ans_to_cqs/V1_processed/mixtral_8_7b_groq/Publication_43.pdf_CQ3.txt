In the context provided, the data annotation technique used for training the deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is class labeling. The dataset consists of images of two classes: Ziziphus lotus shrubs and Bare soil with sparse vegetation. Each image in the dataset is assigned a class label indicating the dominant class in the image.

The provided context does not mention any other data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Bounding box annotation involves drawing a bounding box around each object of interest in an image and labeling it with the corresponding class. Instance segmentation, on the other hand, involves segmenting each instance of an object in an image and labeling it with the corresponding class.

Although the context does not mention these techniques, they are commonly used in deep learning pipelines for object detection and semantic segmentation tasks. For instance, in object detection, bounding box annotation is used to train models to predict the location and class of objects in an image. Similarly, in semantic segmentation, instance segmentation is used to train models to predict the class of each pixel in an image.

In summary, the data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline described in the context is class labeling, where each image is assigned a class label. Other data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation and instance segmentation are commonly used in deep learning pipelines for object detection and semantic segmentation tasks.
