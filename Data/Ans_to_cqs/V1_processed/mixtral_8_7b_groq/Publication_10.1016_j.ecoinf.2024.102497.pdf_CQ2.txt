The provided context does not contain information about the specific data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of GF-6 (WFV) remote sensing data in a study related to bathymetry retrieval. This data is likely in a raster image format, such as GeoTIFF, given that it is used for image analysis and processing.

In general, the choice of data format in a deep learning pipeline depends on the type of data being used. For image data, formats like JPEG, PNG, or TIFF are commonly used. For time-series data or tabular data, formats like CSV, JSON, or HDF5 may be used. For audio or video data, formats like WAV, MP3, or MP4 may be used. Ultimately, the data format is determined by the specific requirements of the project and the tools being used for deep learning.
