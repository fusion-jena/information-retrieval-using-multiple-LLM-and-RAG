Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipelines used in the studies primarily involve image data formats.

1. Sentinel-2 data: This is a type of multispectral image data acquired by the European Space Agency's Sentinel-2 satellite. It has been used in several studies for crop type classification, olive tree identification, and vegetation cover estimation.

2. Airborne hyperspectral remote sensing imagery: This type of image data has been used for leaf chlorophyll content retrieval.

3. UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) multispectral images: These are images captured by drones equipped with multispectral sensors. They have been used for sugar beet growth monitoring and winter-wheat above-ground biomass estimation.

4. Landsat-8 OLI data: This is another type of multispectral image data acquired by the Landsat-8 satellite. It has been used for chlorophyll content estimation in arid grasslands.

5. Visible light image of UAV: This type of image data has been used for vegetation extraction and fractional vegetation cover estimation in Karst areas.

6. 10-m crop type maps: These are maps created from remote sensing data, where each pixel represents a 10m x 10m area on the ground, classified into different crop types.

In summary, the deep learning pipelines described in the provided context primarily use image data formats, specifically multispectral and hyperspectral image data, for various applications in agriculture and environmental monitoring.
