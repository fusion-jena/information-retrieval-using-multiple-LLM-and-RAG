The type of deep learning models used in the pipeline are Deep Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (DeepConvLSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The best validation accuracies were achieved by a DeepConvLSTM model (model 12) with an accuracy of 0.833 ± 0.005, followed by another DeepConvLSTM model (model 19) with an accuracy of 0.829 ± 0.003. The third-best model was a CNN architecture (model 14) with a validation accuracy of 0.821 ± 0.005. These models were selected from a pool of 20 models, generated randomly for each of the four available deep-ANN architecture types, and trained using a subset of the training data. The model with the highest performance was then selected for training on the full training data for up to 30 epochs.
