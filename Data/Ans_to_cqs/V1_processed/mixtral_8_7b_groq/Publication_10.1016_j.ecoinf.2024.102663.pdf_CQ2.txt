Deep learning models can handle various data formats, including images, audio, video, and CSV files, depending on the specific application. In the context of fish biomass estimation, the primary data format used is images.

In the research mentioned, the deep learning pipeline involves using fish images for training and prediction. These images are likely in a standard image format such as JPEG or PNG. The first step in the pipeline is preprocessing the images, which may include color correction algorithms like MSR to enhance image quality. In some cases, underwater films might be used for fish biomass estimation, providing a sequence of frames that can be processed similarly to video data.

Once the images are preprocessed, they are used to train deep learning models for fish detection, classification, and biomass estimation. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly used for image-based tasks in deep learning, and they have been applied for biomass estimation in several studies. In addition, object detection algorithms like YOLO (You Only Look Once) and Mask RCNN (Mask Regional Convolutional Neural Network) have been employed to identify and quantify fish visual dimensions, which contributes to biomass estimation.

Although not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, other data formats like CSV might be used in the deep learning pipeline for tasks such as storing and managing metadata related to the fish images, like fish species, environmental factors, or other relevant information. However, the primary focus of the research discussed is on image-based deep learning for fish biomass estimation.
