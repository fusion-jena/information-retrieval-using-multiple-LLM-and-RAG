Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context mainly focuses on comparing different classification methods, including MLC, SVM, ANN, and RF, and their performance in land cover classification.

However, the context does mention the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in digital soil mapping and land cover classification (Mohammadi & Toomanian, 2016; Saboori, Torahi, & Bakhtyari, 2019). ANNs are a type of deep learning model, and their hyperparameters can include learning rate, optimizer, number of layers, number of neurons, activation function, and regularization techniques.

In general, the learning rate is a hyperparameter that controls the size of the steps that the model takes during training, and the optimizer is a method that determines the best set of weights and biases for the model. Other hyperparameters, such as the number of layers and number of neurons, can affect the complexity and capacity of the model.

Therefore, while the provided context does not specify the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, it is important to note that hyperparameters play a crucial role in the performance and generalization of deep learning models. Proper tuning of hyperparameters can help improve the accuracy and efficiency of the model.
