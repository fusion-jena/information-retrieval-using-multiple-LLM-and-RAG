The provided context does not give specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the study involves image classification and retrieval tasks using a CNN-based model called SeedNet. In the context of computer vision, common data annotation techniques for deep learning include:

1. Image-level annotation: In this method, each image is assigned a single label indicating the presence or absence of a particular class. This is the simplest form of annotation and is often used for image classification tasks.

2. Bounding box annotation: Here, a bounding box is drawn around each instance of a particular object in an image. This technique is commonly used for object detection tasks, where the goal is to locate and classify objects within an image.

3. Semantic segmentation: This method involves dividing an image into multiple regions, each corresponding to a specific class. It provides a pixel-level understanding of the image content.

4. Instance segmentation: This is a more advanced form of semantic segmentation, where each instance of an object is separated and assigned a unique label. This technique is useful for tasks that require counting or tracking individual objects within an image.

Based on the tasks described in the context, it can be inferred that at least image-level annotation was used for the image classification task. However, the specific annotation techniques remain unknown.
