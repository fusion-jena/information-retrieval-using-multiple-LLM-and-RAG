The deep learning models discussed in the provided context are primarily used for birdsong classification. These models are designed to recognize and categorize birdsong into different bird species based on audio recordings. The research acknowledges the potential of automated birdsong recognition systems that integrate computer vision and machine learning principles for monitoring avian biodiversity.

In the study, three fundamental deep neural network architectures, including vision transformers (ViT), are employed to classify 397 different bird species. The ViT models are pretrained using a method similar to BERT for language understanding, and various data augmentation techniques are applied to improve the accuracy and generalizability of the models. The primary augmentation technique involves the integration of different noise samples and non-bird audio elements, which significantly enhances classification performance.

Furthermore, the proposed model architectures for sound event detection are based on DenseNet-161, ResNet-50, and different vision transformers (ViT). These models are designed to identify and classify birdsong in 5-300 seconds snippets of continuous audio recordings. The DenseNets are utilized to improve the information flow and pattern recognition in the audio data.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the deep learning models are primarily designed for birdsong classification, and they leverage sophisticated task-specific methods tailored for varied environmental contexts.
