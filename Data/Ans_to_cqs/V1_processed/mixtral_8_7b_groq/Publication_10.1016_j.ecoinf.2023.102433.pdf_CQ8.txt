Based on the provided context, there is no information given about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the nasawebservice package, which is a library that allows users to query the NASA service to discover available products for a given reference date. The package has various methods such as products(), bands(), dates(), subsets(), and available\_products\_by\_date() for querying the NASA data archive.

However, the context does not mention any details about the deep learning pipeline or its code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.

It is possible that the deep learning pipeline is a separate system from the nasawebservice package, and the code repository may be located in a different place. Without further information, it is not possible to determine the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline.
