The provided context does not directly mention the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss a study that used the MaxEnt model, a machine learning method commonly used in species distribution modeling, to analyze the impact of climate variables on the distribution of Mediterranean plant species.

In this study, the MaxEnt model used climate data from the CliMond dataset, which includes variables such as temperature and precipitation for different time periods and seasons. These variables are likely provided in a tabular format such as CSV, as is common in ecological studies.

Additionally, the study used a digital elevation model (DEM) to incorporate topographic information, which is typically provided as a raster image format such as GeoTIFF.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the deep learning pipeline for this study used a combination of tabular data (CSV) and raster image data (GeoTIFF) as inputs. However, it is important to note that the specific data formats used in a deep learning pipeline can vary depending on the specific problem and data being analyzed.
