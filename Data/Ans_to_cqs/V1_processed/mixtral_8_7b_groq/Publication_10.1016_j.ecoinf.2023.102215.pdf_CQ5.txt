The context provided does not give specific information about the use of standard datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention several specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline in the context of salient object detection (SOD), semantic segmentation (Seg), and object detection (OD).

The datasets mentioned are:

1. Static images and living videos of a commercial orchard
2. RGB-images and point cloud data of a commercial orchard
3. RGB-images of a single tree branch
4. RGB-images of urban streets
5. Synthetic images and natural images of forests
6. RGB-images of a modern apple orchard
7. RGB-images of complex urban scenes

Additionally, the context mentions that the deep learning models used in the pipeline can yield desirable saliency identification results on public datasets, but it does not specify which public datasets were used.

In summary, while the context does not mention the use of standard deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, it does provide information about several specific datasets used in the pipeline for SOD, Seg, and OD tasks.
