Based on the provided context, the data formats used in the deep learning pipelines mentioned are primarily images. In the studies conducted by Malik et al., 2022, Chulif et al., 2023, Barhate et al., 2023, and Ganguly et al., 2022, the deep learning models were used to classify plant species or detect diseases using image data. 

Malik et al., 2022, used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to identify plant species, where the image samples were collected using a box model and preprocessed to increase the sample size. Similarly, Chulif et al., 2023, used deep learning models to detect diseases in single crop species by considering real-time field challenges during image acquisition. 

Barhate et al., 2023, adapted VGG-16 and dimensionality reduction with ESPCA to classify thirty-two plant species using image data. Ganguly et al., 2022, utilized the ResNet-50 architecture to capture leaf feature patterns via fusion learning, where the model was trained on three benchmark datasets of image data. 

Therefore, based on the provided context, image data is primarily used in the deep learning pipelines mentioned. However, the context does not mention the use of other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV.
