Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling in the described deep learning pipeline for downscaling near-surface wind fields to high-resolution topography in complex terrain (Dujardin & Lehning, 2022). 

However, the authors do mention that they used a deep learning model to downscale coarse-resolution wind fields from two datasets (WorldClim and CHELSA) to a higher resolution. To train their model, they created a dataset of input-output pairs by downscaling the coarse-resolution wind fields at specific calibration points using a deterministic downscaling method. They then used this dataset to train their deep learning model. 

It's possible that the authors did not use any data augmentation techniques because the deterministic downscaling method they used may have already provided a diverse enough dataset for training the deep learning model. Alternatively, they may have used other data augmentation techniques that are not explicitly mentioned in the text.

Another possibility is that the authors used cross-validation, which is a technique for evaluating the performance of a machine learning model by training it on different subsets of the data and testing it on the remaining subset. Cross-validation can help to reduce overfitting and improve the generalizability of the model. However, it is not explicitly mentioned in the text whether cross-validation was used.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention any data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling, it is possible that other data augmentation techniques were used. Without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this query.
