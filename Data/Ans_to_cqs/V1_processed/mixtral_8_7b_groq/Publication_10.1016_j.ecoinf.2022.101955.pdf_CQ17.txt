In the context provided, the specific deep learning model used is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), implemented through the "nnet" package in R. While the text does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used, it does mention the use of weighted decay and size tuning parameters to counter the effects of overfitting.

Weighted decay, also known as L2 regularization, is a common method used in machine learning to prevent overfitting. It works by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This penalty term discourages the model from learning overly complex patterns in the training data that may not generalize well to new data.

The "nnet" package in R allows for the use of weighted decay through the "decay" parameter. This parameter controls the strength of the L2 regularization penalty, with larger values resulting in stronger regularization and smaller values allowing for more complex models.

In addition to weighted decay, the "nnet" package also allows for size tuning, which can help prevent overfitting by limiting the complexity of the model. The "size" parameter controls the number of hidden neurons in the ANN, with smaller values resulting in simpler models and larger values allowing for more complex patterns in the data.

While the text does not explicitly mention dropout, it is another regularization method commonly used in deep learning. Dropout works by randomly setting a fraction of the model's hidden neurons to zero during training, which helps prevent overfitting by reducing the co-adaptation of neurons.

Overall, while the specific regularization methods used in the "nnet" package are not explicitly mentioned in the context provided, it is likely that weighted decay and size tuning were used to prevent overfitting in the ANN model. Dropout is another regularization method commonly used in deep learning that was not mentioned in the context.
