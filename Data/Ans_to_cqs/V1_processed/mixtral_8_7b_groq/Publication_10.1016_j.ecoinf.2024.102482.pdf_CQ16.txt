The context does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it can be inferred that the training process might be using a validation dataset to assess model performance and decide when to stop training. This is suggested by the mention of separate training, validation, and test datasets in Table 3, as well as the general practice of using a validation dataset to check model performance and prevent overfitting during training.

In the context of machine learning, a common approach to determine when training is complete is to monitor the performance on the validation dataset and stop training when the performance stops improving or starts degrading, even if the training loss is still decreasing. This is often referred to as early stopping. The context implies that the model's accuracy does not significantly improve with increased observation time, which might indicate that early stopping could be used to prevent overfitting and optimize performance.

Additionally, the context states that the number of stacked LSTM layers, the size of the output vectors, and other necessary model hyperparameters were selected through various experiments to achieve optimal performance. This process might include trying different training termination criteria and evaluating their impact on model performance.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete, it can be inferred that a validation dataset is likely being used for this purpose, and early stopping might be employed to prevent overfitting and optimize performance.
