Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The text focuses on the development of a model for estimating the density of Northern bobwhite, a type of quail, using distance sampling and spatial capture-recapture (SECR) methods.

The model training involves the use of a cue rate sub-model with informative priors for call rate and vague priors for other parameters. Bias and precision are calculated for the point count and ARU distance sampling (DS) methods using root mean squared error (RMSE) and coefficient of variation (CV), respectively.

However, there is no mention of any postprocessing steps typically used in machine learning models, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Saliency maps are often used in image classification tasks to visualize the important features learned by the model. Metrics calculation involves evaluating the performance of the model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot specify the postprocessing steps involved after the model training.
