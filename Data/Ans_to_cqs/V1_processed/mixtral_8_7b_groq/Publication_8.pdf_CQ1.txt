Based on the provided context, the specific methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for the study about detecting and annotating plant organs from digitised herbarium scans are not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that the raw data used in this study comes from digitised herbarium sheets. Herbarium sheets are physical specimens of plants that are collected, identified, and preserved in institutions around the world. Digitisation of these herbarium sheets involves scanning or photographing the specimens to create digital images. These digital images serve as the raw data for the deep learning pipeline in this study.

The process of creating these digitised herbarium sheets is not discussed in detail in the provided context, but it can be assumed that traditional methods of herbarium specimen collection and preparation were used. These methods may include collecting plant specimens from the field, identifying and labeling the specimens, and preserving them in a herbarium. Once the specimens are preserved, they can be digitised, and the resulting digital images can be used as raw data for deep learning analysis.

Therefore, while the specific methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned, it can be inferred that the raw data comes from digitised herbarium sheets, which are created through traditional herbarium specimen collection and preservation methods.
