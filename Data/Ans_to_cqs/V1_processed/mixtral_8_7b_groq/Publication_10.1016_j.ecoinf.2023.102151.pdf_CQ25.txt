Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the purpose of a deep learning model. However, there are references to machine learning techniques used in various fields such as digital soil mapping, river analysis and mapping, and soil moisture estimation. These techniques are used for classification, segmentation, or detection purposes.

In the context of digital soil mapping, machine learning techniques such as Random Forest, Cubist, and Support Vector Machine are used for classification purposes (Geoderma 265, 62–77). In the context of river analysis and mapping, machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machine, Decision Trees, and Random Forest are used for classification purposes (Remote Sens. Environ. 202, 88–97). In the context of soil moisture estimation, machine learning techniques such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Artificial Neural Network are used for regression purposes (Environ. Modell. Softw. 157, 105505).

Deep learning models are a subset of machine learning techniques that are based on artificial neural networks with many layers (hence "deep"). They are used for various purposes such as classification, segmentation, detection, and regression. In the context of soil science, deep learning models can be used for classification purposes such as identifying different soil types or soil properties. They can also be used for segmentation purposes such as separating different regions of a soil image based on their properties. Additionally, deep learning models can be used for detection purposes such as identifying the presence of certain features in a soil image, such as roots or pests.

In summary, while there is no specific information about the purpose of a deep learning model in the provided context, deep learning models are a type of machine learning technique that can be used for various purposes such as classification, segmentation, detection, and regression. In the context of soil science, deep learning models can be used for classification, segmentation, and detection purposes.
