Based on the information provided, there is no explicit mention of how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the use of the FWI and FFMC data layers with a spatial resolution of 1 Ã— 1 km and the application of a nine-cell approach, but it does not provide details about the optimization of the model's hyperparameters.

Typically, hyperparameter optimization can be carried out using methods such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization. In a grid search, the model is trained for each combination of hyperparameters within a predefined grid. In contrast, random search randomly selects hyperparameters from predefined ranges and trains the model with these values. Bayesian optimization, on the other hand, uses probabilistic modeling to select the most promising hyperparameters for evaluation.

However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer regarding the hyperparameter optimization approach used in this specific case.
