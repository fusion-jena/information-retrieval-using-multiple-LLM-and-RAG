The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this context are not explicitly stated to be accuracy, precision, or recall. However, based on the information provided, the following evaluation metrics can be identified:

1. R-squared (R2): This metric is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance for a dependent variable that's explained by an independent variable or variables in a regression model. It provides a measure of how well observed outcomes are replicated by the model, based on the proportion of total variation of outcomes explained by the model.

2. Mean Absolute Error (MAE): This is a measure of the differences between predicted and actual values. It calculates the average of the absolute differences between prediction and actual observation. Lower values indicate better performance.

3. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): This is another measure of the differences between predicted and actual values. It calculates the square root of the average of the squared differences between the prediction and the actual observation. Like MAE, lower values indicate better performance.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the machine learning models, including the deep learning model (Artificial Neural Network) in predicting Above Ground Biomass (AGB). The models were trained on 70% of the samples and validated on the remaining 30%. The performance of the models was evaluated based on how well they predicted AGB, as compared to the actual observed values.
