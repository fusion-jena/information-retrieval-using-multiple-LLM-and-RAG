Based on the provided context, there is no direct link to a data repository for a deep learning pipeline. However, there are several papers and theses that discuss the use of machine learning and deep learning for estimating aboveground biomass using LiDAR and Landsat data.

For instance, the study by Zhang et al. (2019) titled "Deep learning based retrieval of forest aboveground biomass" discusses the use of a deep learning model for estimating aboveground biomass. The study by Ali et al. (2015) titled "Review of machine learning approaches for biomass and soil moisture retrievals from remote sensing data" provides a comprehensive review of various machine learning approaches for biomass retrieval.

Furthermore, the Republic grant number QK1910150 suggests that there may be a publicly funded project related to this research, which may have associated data repositories. However, without more specific information, it is difficult to provide a direct link to the data repository for the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, while there is relevant research on the use of machine learning and deep learning for biomass estimation, the specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline is not provided in the given context.
