The provided context does not explicitly mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning models. The text focuses on the development of two novel deep learning networks for fish identification in turbid waters, one using semi-supervised contrastive learning and the other using weak supervision. It discusses the data collection, labeling, training times, and accuracy of these models, but it does not specify the platform used for deployment. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
