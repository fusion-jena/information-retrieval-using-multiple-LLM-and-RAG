The text provided does not give specific details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model after training. However, it does provide information about the training process and the architecture of the model.

The YOLOv8 model was used as the base model for the experiments, and a sequence of 10 ablation experiments were conducted to evaluate the enhancements made to various components of the network architecture. The training parameters used for these experiments include a batch size of 16, input image resolution of 640 Ã— 640, 150 epochs, a learning rate of 0.01, and the Adam optimizer. Additionally, the depth\_scale parameter was assigned a value of 0.33, and the width\_scale parameter was set to 0.25.

The SPPF module was added to the network architecture to enrich gradient flow information while maintaining a lightweight structure. This module processes objects with different scales by combining serial and parallel modes of max pooling, which enhances the model's resilience to spatial layout and object degradation. The module consists of a standard Conv operation followed by kernel sizes of 5, 9, and 13 for Max pooling. The results are concatenated with the Conv module for extracting shallow semantic features, which are then passed through a final Conv module.

The feature fusion is performed using two network architectures, the feature pyramid network (FPN) and the path aggregation network (PAN), which are used to solve the problem of multiscale feature fusion and strengthen the integration and utilization of features. The neck network is positioned between the backbone network and the head network.

Therefore, while the text does not provide specific information about the deployment process, it does provide details about the training process and the architecture of the model, which are important steps in the deployment of a deep learning model.
