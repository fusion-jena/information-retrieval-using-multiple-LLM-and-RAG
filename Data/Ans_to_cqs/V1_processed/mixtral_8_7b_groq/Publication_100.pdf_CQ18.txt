The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of a validation loss metric. Specifically, the learning rate of the optimizer is automatically reduced by a factor of 0.1 when the validation loss has not improved for 15 consecutive epochs. This technique is known as learning rate decay and is a common approach to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization performance of deep learning models. By reducing the learning rate, the model is encouraged to make smaller updates to its weights and biases, which can help it converge to a better minimum of the loss function.

In addition to learning rate decay, the models are trained with an Adam optimizer, which is a popular choice for optimizing neural networks due to its efficiency and robustness. The Adam optimizer uses an adaptive learning rate that is computed separately for each parameter of the model, based on the historical gradient information. This allows the optimizer to adjust the learning rate dynamically during training, which can further improve the model's convergence behavior.

The validation loss is computed using a separate dataset that is not used for training. This dataset, known as the validation set, is used to estimate the model's performance on unseen data and provide an unbiased estimate of its generalization error. By monitoring the validation loss during training, the learning rate decay strategy can prevent overfitting and ensure that the model is learning meaningful patterns from the training data.

Overall, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves a combination of learning rate decay and the use of a validation set. This approach allows the model to converge to a better minimum of the loss function and improve its generalization performance, which is particularly important when training on large data sets.
