The provided context does not give specific details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does provide information about the training and prediction runtimes of different CNN models, including VGG16, Xception, ResNet50, DenseNet121, and a proposed model.

Additionally, the context discusses the need for cryptographic techniques to protect the privacy of confidential information when processing data using models. The research investigates PPDL (Privacy-Preserving Deep Learning) for satellite image classification.

Based on the information provided, we can infer that after training the model, it was tested for prediction runtime. However, the deployment process, such as model serialization, platform selection, and integration with other systems, is not discussed.

Therefore, we cannot provide a specific answer to the query based on the given context.
