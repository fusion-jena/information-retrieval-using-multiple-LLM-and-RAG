The provided context does not give specific details about the learning rate or the optimizer used in the deep learning model. The model is a deep neural network with a cross-entropy loss function, and the number of training samples is increased to optimize the parameters. The model is based on the Inception v3 architecture, and the threshold λ is determined to minimize the average species assemblage size while ensuring that the average error rate is lower than a predefined ϵ objective. However, the specific hyperparameters such as the learning rate and optimizer are not mentioned.
