The pieces of context provided do not specify the use of standard datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet in the deep learning pipelines. Instead, they refer to various studies that have used different datasets for specific tasks related to remote sensing and vegetation classification.

For instance, Neves et al. (2020) used high spatial resolution satellite data for semantic segmentation of Brazilian savanna vegetation. Similarly, Nogueira et al. (2016) employed a dataset for vegetation species discrimination using data-driven descriptors. Torres et al. (2020) used deeplabv3+ variants for semantic segmentation of endangered tree species in Brazilian savanna.

Moreover, Zhang et al. (47) tested the efficiency of using datasets containing four and eight bands of the WorldView-2 and WorldView-3 images for classifying urban targets. They achieved better accuracies with the eight-band dataset, but it is unclear if they used this dataset for vegetation classification.

In summary, while the pieces of context do not mention the use of standard deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, they refer to various studies that have used custom datasets for remote sensing and vegetation classification tasks. These datasets include high spatial resolution satellite data, WorldView-2 and WorldView-3 images, and other datasets specifically designed for vegetation classification.
