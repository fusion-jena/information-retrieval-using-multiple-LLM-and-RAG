Based on the provided context, there is no information about deep learning models, their hyperparameters, or any related concepts such as learning rate or optimizer. The context focuses on explaining different types of estimators (NN1, NN2, NN3, NN4) and their performance in forest management for estimating structural complexity.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer related to deep learning hyperparameters, as the context does not contain any information about deep learning models.
