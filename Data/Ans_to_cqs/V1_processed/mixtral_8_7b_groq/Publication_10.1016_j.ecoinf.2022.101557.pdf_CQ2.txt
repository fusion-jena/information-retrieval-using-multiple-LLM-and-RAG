The provided context discusses a specific application of deep learning to identify wetlands using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), but it does not mention the exact data format used as input to the CNN. However, based on the common usage of CNNs in computer vision tasks, it can be inferred that the input data format is likely images.

Before feeding the data into the CNN, the image data is pre-processed by splitting the map into several larger blocks for cross-validation purposes. Then, each block is further divided into smaller areas of 80 Ã— 80 pixels due to limitations in the available amount of data.

Therefore, the data format used in this deep learning pipeline is image data, specifically maps, which are split into smaller areas for pre-processing and cross-validation.
