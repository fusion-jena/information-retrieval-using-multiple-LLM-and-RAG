The optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) (Bottero, 2012). This optimization function is used for training the state-of-the-art YOLOv5s model in the experiment.

SGD is a popular optimization algorithm used for training neural networks. It updates the parameters of the model by computing the gradient of the loss function concerning each parameter and then adjusting the parameters in the direction that minimizes the loss. SGD is an iterative algorithm that processes one training example at a time, making it computationally efficient and suitable for large datasets.

The choice of SGD as the optimization function in this experiment is appropriate because it has been shown to perform well in training deep learning models. Additionally, SGD has several variants, such as momentum and adaptive learning rate methods, that can further improve the optimization process.

However, it is worth noting that other optimization techniques, such as Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2015), Adagrad (Duchi et al., 2011), and RMSprop (Tieleman and Hinton, 2012), have been developed and are widely used in deep learning applications. These optimization algorithms have different update rules and may perform better than SGD in certain scenarios.

Therefore, while SGD is the optimization function used in the experiment described in the context, it is not the only optimization technique available for deep learning pipelines. The choice of optimization function depends on the specific problem, dataset, and model architecture.
