I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The references mainly discuss the use of deep learning techniques for remote sensing and wetland mapping, as well as comparisons with other machine learning methods such as XGBoost and shallow learning techniques. However, they do not provide a specific link to a data repository for the deep learning pipeline.
