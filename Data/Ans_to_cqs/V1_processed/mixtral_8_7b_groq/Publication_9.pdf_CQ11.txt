Based on the provided context, there is no specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline mentioned. However, there are several papers and tools mentioned that are related to the use of deep learning in image processing for ecology and evolutionary biology.

One of the papers, "Sashimi: A toolkit for facilitating high-throughput organismal image segmentation using deep learning" by Schwartz and Alfaro (2021), presents a toolkit for image segmentation using deep learning. The paper provides a link to the toolkit's GitHub repository, which contains the code and data used in the study (<https://github.com/shawn-t-schwartz/sashimi>).

Another paper, "patternize: An R package for quantifying colour pattern variation" by Van Belleghem et al. (2018), presents an R package for quantifying colour pattern variation. The paper provides a link to the package's GitHub repository, which contains the code and data used in the study (<https://github.com/svanbelleghem/patternize>).

Additionally, the paper "The iNaturalist species classification and detection dataset" by Van Horn et al. (2018) presents a dataset for species classification and detection. The dataset is available on the iNaturalist website (<https://www.inaturalist.org/>).

Therefore, while there is no specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline, there are several related resources available for researchers interested in using deep learning for image processing in ecology and evolutionary biology.
