The provided context does not give specific information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does provide some information about the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the models. These metrics include Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), which are commonly used to evaluate the difference between predicted and actual values in regression problems.

In the context, RMSE and MAE are calculated for both training and testing datasets, denoted as RMSE\_Train, MAE\_Train, RMSE\_Test, and MAE\_Test. These metrics are used to compare the performance of the models with and without the incorporation of spatial dimensions.

In general, the data for deep learning model training is typically split into three sets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune the model's hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

However, the context does not provide information on how the data was split for training, validation, and testing. It is possible that a different approach was taken, such as using cross-validation or a time series split, depending on the specific characteristics of the data and the problem being addressed.

Therefore, while the context provides some insight into the evaluation metrics used for the models, it does not provide specific information about the criteria used to split the data for training.
