The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the context provided, which references several papers and resources related to CNNs. For instance, the model is based on GoogleNet [35], which is a well-known CNN architecture. Additionally, the Caffe framework [37] is used for implementation, and Caffe is a popular deep learning framework primarily used for CNNs. Furthermore, the model uses batch normalization [36], a technique commonly used in CNNs to accelerate training. The experiments and results also focus on image classification tasks, which are typically addressed using CNNs. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model used in this pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
