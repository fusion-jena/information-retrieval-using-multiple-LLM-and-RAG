The text provided gives a detailed explanation of the Wav2Vec model, its architecture, and the training process, but it does not explicitly describe the steps taken to deploy the trained model. However, based on common deep learning deployment practices, we can infer some possible steps that might have been taken.

 

The deployment process typically begins with model serialization, which involves saving the trained model's architecture and weights to a file. This file can then be used to recreate the model without having to retrain it. In Python, this is often done using libraries like `joblib` or `pickle`. 

Next, the platform for deployment is selected. This could be a local machine, a cloud server, or an edge device, depending on the use case. If the model is to be deployed on a cloud server, the serialized model file would be uploaded to the server. 

The model would then be integrated into an application or service. This could involve creating a REST API endpoint that accepts audio files as input, passes them through the model for prediction, and returns the results. Alternatively, the model could be embedded into a larger application, such as a mobile app or a website.

Finally, the model would be tested and validated in the deployment environment to ensure it performs as expected. This could involve testing the model on a separate set of data, or using techniques like A/B testing to compare the model's performance with and without the deep learning component.

It's important to note that the specific steps and tools used for deployment can vary widely depending on the use case, the platform, and the deep learning framework used. The text provided does not give enough information to determine the exact steps taken in this case, but the above steps provide a general idea of the deployment process.
