Based on the provided context, the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation) is not mentioned. However, it is mentioned that the ML pipeline was written in python using theano and lasagne for ML and librosa for audio processing. These tools provide functionalities for splitting data into training, validation, and test sets. A common approach is to randomly split the data into a training set (e.g., 70%), a validation set (e.g., 15%), and a test set (e.g., 15%). The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and select the best model, and the test set is used to evaluate the final model's performance. Additionally, it is mentioned that the data was randomly selected from the remaining sites, but it is not specified if this random selection was used for splitting the data into the aforementioned sets.
