The provided context does not contain specific information about addressing data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some techniques related to data processing and classification.

In the context "Cohen, N., Shashua, A., 2017. Inductive bias of Deep Convolutional Networks through Pooling Geometry International Conference on Learning Representations, Toulon, France," the authors discuss the inductive bias of deep convolutional networks through pooling geometry, but it does not mention any techniques related to addressing data bias during preprocessing.

The context "Di Gregorio, A., Jansen, L., 2005. Land Cover Classification System: Classification Concepts and User Manual: LCCS, Vol. 2. Food & Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO)" discusses the Land Cover Classification System and its classification concepts, but it does not mention any techniques related to addressing data bias during preprocessing.

The other contexts provided are related to archaeological surveys, flora of Israel, the evolution of the cultural Mediterranean landscape, and mathematical notation, which are not related to the query.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot provide specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some common techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. These techniques aim to ensure that the training data is representative of the overall population and to prevent the deep learning model from being biased towards certain classes or patterns in the data.
