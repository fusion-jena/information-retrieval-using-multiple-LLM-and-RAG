The provided context includes several metrics used to evaluate the performance of models in classifying iceplant and other vegetation, but it does not explicitly mention the deep learning model. However, I will list some of the metrics that are commonly used to evaluate the performance of machine learning and deep learning models.

1. Accuracy: Accuracy is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of input samples. It is a common metric used to evaluate the performance of a model. In the provided context, the overall accuracy is given for different models and window sizes.

2. Precision: Precision is the ratio of true positives (TP) to the sum of true positives and false positives (FP). It measures the proportion of correct positive predictions out of all positive predictions made by the model.

3. Recall (Sensitivity): Recall is the ratio of true positives (TP) to the sum of true positives and false negatives (FN). It measures the proportion of correctly identified positive samples out of all actual positive samples.

4. F1-score: F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It provides a single metric that encapsulates both precision and recall.

5. Producer's Accuracy (PA): Producer's Accuracy is the ratio of true positives (TP) to the total number of actual positive samples (n). It measures how well the model identifies the positive class.

6. User's Accuracy (UA): User's Accuracy is the ratio of true positives (TP) to the total number of predicted positive samples (TP + FP). It measures how well the model's predictions match the actual positive class.

In the provided context, TP, TN, FP, and FN are given for different models and window sizes, which can be used to calculate precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, Producer's Accuracy and User's Accuracy are provided for some models, which are specific cases of precision and recall, respectively.

In summary, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Producer's Accuracy, and User's Accuracy are common metrics used to evaluate the performance of machine learning and deep learning models. The provided context includes information that can be used to calculate some of these metrics for models classifying iceplant and other vegetation.
