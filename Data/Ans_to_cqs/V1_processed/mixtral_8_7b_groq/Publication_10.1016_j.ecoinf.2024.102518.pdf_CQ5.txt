Based on the provided context, this query cannot be directly answered because it discusses a different topic - a species distribution modeling study, not a deep learning pipeline using datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, I can provide some information about the datasets used in the mentioned study.

The study used occurrence data and environmental variables to model species distribution. Occurrence data represents the presence of a species at specific locations, while environmental variables are factors that might influence the species' distribution, such as temperature, precipitation, or land cover type.

In the study, the occurrence data is likely to be a set of geographic coordinates (longitude and latitude) indicating the locations where the species was found. Environmental variable datasets might include raster data (gridded data) of climate, topography, and land cover.

Specifically, the study used a feature class 'LQP' and a regularization multiplier of 3.5. The feature class 'LQP' is a combination of land cover classes, and the regularization multiplier is a parameter used in the modeling process. However, the context does not provide specific names or sources for these datasets.

In summary, the provided context discusses a species distribution modeling study using occurrence data and environmental variables, but it does not mention any standard deep learning datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
