The provided context does not explicitly mention which frameworks were used to build the deep learning model. However, it does mention that a pre-trained CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) on ImageNet was used. Both TensorFlow and PyTorch, two popular deep learning frameworks, provide ways to use pre-trained models including those from ImageNet.

For instance, TensorFlow offers the `tensorflow.keras.applications` module which includes a variety of pre-trained models, including several from ImageNet. Similarly, PyTorch provides the `torchvision.models` module which also includes pre-trained models from ImageNet.

Therefore, while the context does not specifically say, it's highly likely that either TensorFlow or PyTorch (or potentially another deep learning framework) was used to implement the approach, given that they are both widely used and provide easy access to pre-trained ImageNet models.
