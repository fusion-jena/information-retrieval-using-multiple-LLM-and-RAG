The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involved the use of a systematic sampling approach to select training sites from a Landsat image collection, with a focus on ensuring representation from all land use and land cover (LULC) classes. Specifically, seventy training sites were chosen for each of the five classes (mines, water, forest, urban areas, and bare soil) using a stratified random sampling method. This resulted in a total of 350 points per image, distributed across the entire study area.

To ensure the quality of the training data, the selection of training sites was guided by several factors. First, the previously created Landsat image collection was used as a basemap. Second, a previously created cloud mask was applied to avoid cloud-covered areas when selecting training sites. Third, the previously created cluster classification map was used as a further guide for class selection.

The performance of the reclassification model was evaluated based on the accuracy of mining detection. The initial accuracy was 72% (65% producer accuracy, 79% user accuracy), but through the implementation of the aforementioned training strategy, the accuracy was improved to 89.5% (84% producer accuracy, 95% user accuracy).

It is important to note that the training data selection strategy was designed to address the common issue of isolated, misclassified pixels in LULC classification maps, especially those done on a large scale. By selecting mines above a minimum size of 3 pixels (or > 2700 m2 in a Landsat Image), the influence of small, misclassified pixels was removed, ensuring the most accurate result could be achieved.

In summary, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involved a systematic sampling approach to select training sites from a Landsat image collection, with a focus on ensuring representation from all LULC classes. The performance of the reclassification model was evaluated based on the accuracy of mining detection, which was improved through the implementation of this training strategy.
