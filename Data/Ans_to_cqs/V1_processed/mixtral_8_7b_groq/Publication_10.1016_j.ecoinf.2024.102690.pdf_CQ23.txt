The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a deep learning model. Instead, it discusses the use of the Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM), an unsupervised learning neural network, and other statistical methods to analyze ecological data. Therefore, I cannot provide information on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model in this specific context.

However, I can provide a general explanation of how deep learning models can be made generalizable using techniques such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, and stratified splitting.

1. Diverse dataset: A diverse dataset includes a wide range of examples that cover various scenarios, input variations, and edge cases. By training a deep learning model on a diverse dataset, the model is exposed to a variety of patterns and is more likely to learn features that are relevant in new, unseen data.

2. Cross-validation: Cross-validation is a technique used to assess the performance and generalizability of a machine learning model. It involves dividing the dataset into multiple folds, training the model on a subset of the data, and evaluating its performance on the remaining portion. This process is repeated for each fold, and the average performance is calculated. Cross-validation helps prevent overfitting and gives a more reliable estimate of the model's performance on new data.

3. Stratified splitting: Stratified splitting is a method used to divide a dataset into training and testing subsets while preserving the original dataset's class distribution. By using stratified splitting, the deep learning model is exposed to a balanced representation of classes during training, which can improve its ability to generalize to new data.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model, generalizability in deep learning models can be achieved through techniques such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, and stratified splitting.
