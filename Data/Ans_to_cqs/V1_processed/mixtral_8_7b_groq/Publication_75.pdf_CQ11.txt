The provided context does not contain information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on describing the experimental setup, results, and comparison of a deep learning model called SeedNet for image classification and retrieval tasks. However, it does not mention or provide a link to the data repository used in the study. Therefore, I am unable to provide the requested information.
