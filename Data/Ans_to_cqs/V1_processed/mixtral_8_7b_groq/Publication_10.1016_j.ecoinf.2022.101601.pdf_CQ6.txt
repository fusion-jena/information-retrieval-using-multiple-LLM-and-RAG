The provided context discusses the validation and refinement of a model named PermaBN, but it does not directly mention preprocessing steps for training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does describe changes made to the pre-validation model during its validation, which can give us some insight into the refinement process.

During the validation of PermaBN, several changes were made to the pre-validation model. These changes include renaming and redefining nodes, such as renaming the "Node: Active Layer" to "Thaw Depth" and redefining "Node: Soil Particle Size" to "Soil Density." Additionally, some nodes were removed, like the "Node: Vegetation Density/Height" which was replaced by nodes N, A, EM, EQ, S-EM, and X.

While these changes do not directly correspond to typical preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning, they do suggest a refinement process where the model's components are carefully examined, defined, and renamed to better suit the specific problem and data at hand.

In general, preprocessing steps for deep learning models can include:

1. Normalization: This involves scaling features to a similar range, often between 0 and 1, to prevent any single feature from dominating the learning process.
2. Scaling: Similar to normalization, scaling involves transforming features to have a similar scale, often by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.
3. Cleaning: This includes handling missing values, removing outliers, and correcting inconsistent or invalid data.

Therefore, while the provided context does not directly answer the query, it does suggest a rigorous validation and refinement process for the PermaBN model. Additionally, it is important to note that preprocessing steps can vary depending on the specific problem, data, and deep learning model being used.
