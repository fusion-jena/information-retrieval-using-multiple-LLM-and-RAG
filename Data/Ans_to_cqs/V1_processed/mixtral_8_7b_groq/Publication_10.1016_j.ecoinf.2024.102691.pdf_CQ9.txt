The provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of a depth-attention YOLOv5 model for fruit detection, including details about the network architecture, training process, and evaluation. However, it does not mention where the data or code for this pipeline is stored or made available. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.

It is common practice for researchers to make their data and code publicly available to promote transparency and reproducibility. However, the context does not specify whether this is the case for the YOLOv5 model in question. If you are interested in accessing the data or code for this model, I would recommend contacting the authors directly to inquire about availability.

Here are the details of the authors and the sources where the information is from:

1. S. Kaukab et al. (EcologicalInformatics82(2024)1026917)
2. S. Kaukab et al. (EcologicalInformatics82(2024)1026916)

I hope this information is helpful. Let me know if you have any further questions!
