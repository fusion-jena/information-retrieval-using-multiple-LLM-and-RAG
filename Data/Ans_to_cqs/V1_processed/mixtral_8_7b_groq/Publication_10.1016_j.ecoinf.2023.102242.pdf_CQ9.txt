Based on the provided context, there is no information given about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The text describes a study that uses high-resolution remote sensing data from a GF-1 satellite and employs feature optimization tools for image processing. However, it does not mention where the data or the code for the deep learning pipeline is stored or made available. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
