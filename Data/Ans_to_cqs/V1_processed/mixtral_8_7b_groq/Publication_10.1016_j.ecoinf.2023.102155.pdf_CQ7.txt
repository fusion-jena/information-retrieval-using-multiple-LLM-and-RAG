Based on the provided context, there is no information given about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context mainly focuses on comparing the performance of different algorithms for predicting intensity maps in ecological informatics.

The study compares the performance of new algorithms based on mixture modeling (EM algorithm) and machine learning (semi-supervised learning) with the simple approach of fitting individual PPMs (Point Process Models) to the points with known species labels only. The study incorporates lasso penalization and bias correction in the new algorithms and tests their performance in the context of low species abundance.

The study shows the predicted intensity maps with 80% hidden observations for different combinations of lasso regularization and bias correction. The results for 20% and 50% hidden observations are shown in Appendix A.1.2. The study focuses on the best performing methods across the performance measures (knn, LoopT).

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to answer the query regarding the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training.
