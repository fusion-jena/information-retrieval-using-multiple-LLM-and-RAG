The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, as described in the context, is into training, validation, and total datasets. The training dataset is used to train the model, the validation dataset is used to tune the model's parameters and prevent overfitting, and the total dataset is the sum of the training and validation datasets. In the study, the training dataset consists of 7773 images, the validation dataset consists of 1943 images, and the total dataset consists of 9717 images. These datasets are used to evaluate the performance of 8 deep learning algorithms for bird object detection in camera trap images. The specific criteria used to split the data in this study is not explicitly stated, but generally, the training dataset is a large portion of the total dataset, and the validation dataset is a smaller portion. The training and validation datasets should be representative of the total dataset to ensure that the model can generalize well to new, unseen data.
