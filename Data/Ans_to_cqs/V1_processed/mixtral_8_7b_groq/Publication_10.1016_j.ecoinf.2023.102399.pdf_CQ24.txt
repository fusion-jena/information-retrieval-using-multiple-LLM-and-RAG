While the provided context does not contain direct information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does offer some insights through the mentioned studies that use neural networks in the field of aquaculture.

In the study "Fully automatic system for fish biomass estimation based on deep neural network" by Zhang et al., they used a deep neural network for fish biomass estimation. Although they do not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness, they do use a random seed value for their experiments (Zhang et al., 2024). This implies that they might have used a fixed random seed value for reproducibility, which is a common practice in deep learning to handle randomness.

Another study, "Cascaded deep network systems with linked ensemble components for underwater fish detection in the wild" by Labao and Naval (2019), uses cascaded deep network systems for underwater fish detection. They do not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness either. However, the use of ensemble components suggests that they might have employed techniques such as bagging or boosting, which implicitly handle randomness through the creation of multiple models with different subsets of the training data.

In the study "Nonintrusive methods for biomass estimation in aquaculture with emphasis on fish: a review" by Li, Hao, and Duan (2019), the authors discuss various nonintrusive methods for biomass estimation, including the use of neural networks. They do not specifically address strategies for handling randomness. However, they do mention the importance of data preprocessing and feature engineering, which can indirectly help in handling randomness by providing better-structured data and more meaningful features for the neural network to learn from.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not offer explicit information on strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does suggest some practices that might be used to handle randomness, such as using fixed random seed values, bagging or boosting, and data preprocessing. However, further investigation would be required to provide a comprehensive answer.
