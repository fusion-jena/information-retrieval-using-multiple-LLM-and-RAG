The provided context discusses a study related to COVID-19 cases and the factors affecting them, using Big Data related to environmental data and air pollution. However, it does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.

The context does mention some sources of the data used in the study:

* GUS: This is likely a statistical office or similar organization in Poland, as the study is a Polish study. GUS could be a source of data collected through surveys or administrative records.
* OpenStreetMap: This is a crowdsourced project that creates a free editable map of the world. The data from this source is likely related to geographic information and could be collected through sensors or other means.
* Money.pl: This is a Polish financial news and services website. The context mentions a study from this source related to the contribution of industrial or mining workplaces to the emergence of disease outbreaks. This data could be collected through surveys or other means.

Therefore, based on the context, it can be inferred that the raw data for the deep learning pipeline in this study could have been collected through a variety of methods, including surveys, administrative records, crowdsourced projects, and sensors. However, the specific methods used are not mentioned in the provided context.
