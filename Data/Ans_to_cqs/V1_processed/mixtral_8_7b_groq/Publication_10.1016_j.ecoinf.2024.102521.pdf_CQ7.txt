The provided context does not give specific details about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in the STARdbi pipeline. However, it does mention that STARdbi_train is an interface provided by the site for training and storing models using their computational resources. The input for this step is the output directory of STARdbi\_split\_images, which suggests that the data splitting might take place in the STARdbi\_split\_images step.

STARdbi\_split\_images is responsible for preparing the data by splitting the input images into training and testing sets. However, the context does not provide information on how this splitting is done, such as whether it is random, based on a certain percentage, or if there are any specific criteria for assigning images to the train or test sets.

In the absence of specific information, it can be assumed that the data splitting in STARdbi\_split\_images follows common practices in deep learning, such as random splitting with a predefined ratio (e.g., 80% train, 20% test) or using cross-validation techniques. However, this is an assumption, and the actual criteria used for data splitting in the STARdbi pipeline may differ.

In summary, the provided context does not offer specific information about the criteria used for data splitting in the STARdbi pipeline. It can be assumed that common data splitting practices are followed, but this remains an assumption.
