Based on the information provided, there is no specific mention of the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that cloud computing platforms and dedicated servers are commonly used as computing infrastructure for implementing data processing and analytics. These platforms often provide GPU and TPU capabilities for training deep learning models. Therefore, it can be inferred that GPUs or TPUs are likely used for training the deep learning model in the context of smart farming systems.

Additionally, the article "Fully automatic system for fish biomass estimation based on deep neural network" mentions the use of a deep neural network but does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training. Considering the publication year of 2024, it is reasonable to assume that GPU or TPU resources were utilized for deep learning model training, as they have become standard hardware for deep learning tasks in recent years.

In summary, while there is no explicit mention of the hardware resources used for training deep learning models in the provided context, it can be inferred that GPUs or TPUs are likely used, given the common practice of utilizing cloud computing platforms and the widespread use of GPUs and TPUs for deep learning tasks.
