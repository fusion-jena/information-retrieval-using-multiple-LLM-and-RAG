Based on the provided context, there is no explicit description of a strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it is mentioned that the model's performance is evaluated using three criteria - accuracy, recall, and F1-score - after the training process. 

The confusion matrix is used to calculate these evaluation metrics. The confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the predictions made by the model. It consists of four categories: true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN). These categories are used to calculate the evaluation metrics as follows:

Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
F1-Score = 2TP / (2TP + FP + FN)

The context also mentions that the Elastic Net method was used to improve the model's performance and overcome overfitting in small datasets. Elastic Net is a regularization technique that linearly combines the L1 and L2 penalties of the Lasso and Ridge methods. It encourages the model to have a simpler and more interpretable structure, which can help prevent overfitting.

Moreover, the detailed data corresponding to Figure 5 is provided in Table 4, which illustrates the evaluation metrics on the SK and ESK models for three datasets. The results show that adding Elastic Net improved the classification performance of the ESK model for all datasets.

In summary, while there is no explicit description of a strategy to monitor the model's performance during training, the context provides information on how the model's performance is evaluated after training using accuracy, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, it is mentioned that Elastic Net was used to improve the model's performance and prevent overfitting.
