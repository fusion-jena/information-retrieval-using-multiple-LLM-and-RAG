The provided context does not give specific details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does provide some information about the machine configuration used for data processing and the experimental parameter settings.

The machine configuration includes an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7700K CPU @ 4.20GHz, 32G memory, NVIDIA GeForce GTX TITAN Xp video card, Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1 ~ 16.04.5 operating system, Cuda8.0 with cudnn, and python2.7, OpenCV, TensorFlow for data processing. This suggests that the machine used for training and deploying the model has a powerful CPU, a large amount of memory, and a high-end graphics card, which are typical requirements for deploying deep learning models.

Regarding the experimental parameter settings, the context mentions the use of a vision transformer (ViT) model, which is a deep neural network based on the Transformer architecture. The ViT model uses a Self Attention mechanism to combine data from the entire image and accurately model lengthy sequence information. The images are converted into fixed-size tokens, and the relationship between distinct tokens is crucial for modeling the relationships between image features.

However, the context does not provide information on how the trained model was serialized or deployed on a specific platform. Model serialization is the process of saving the trained model's architecture and weights to a file, which can be loaded later for inference. Platform selection involves choosing the appropriate hardware and software environment for deploying the model, such as a cloud-based platform, an edge device, or a mobile application.

Therefore, while the context provides some relevant information about the machine configuration and experimental parameter settings, it does not provide a complete answer to the query regarding the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
