The text does not provide direct information about the methods used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the model was tested using a dataset with 18 different fish species, which suggests that some effort was made to ensure diversity in the dataset.

In addition, the model was trained using four different training datasets (T1, T2, T3, and T4) and its performance was compared across these datasets. This approach can help to identify any biases or overfitting that may have occurred in the training process and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

Furthermore, the model's raw outputs were post-processed using two decision rules (r1 and r2) to improve its performance. Decision rule r1 helps to reduce false positives by providing the fish class with the highest probability when the network's first proposition is 'environment' with a confidence lower than 99%. Decision rule r2 helps to identify a part of a species as a correct answer, which increased the success rate to 94.1%. These post-processing steps can also help to improve the model's generalizability by reducing errors and increasing accuracy.

Overall, while the text does not provide explicit information about the methods used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, it does suggest that some efforts were made to test the model's performance across different datasets and improve its accuracy through post-processing.
