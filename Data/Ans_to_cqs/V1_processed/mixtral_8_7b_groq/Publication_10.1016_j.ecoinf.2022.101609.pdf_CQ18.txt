To monitor the model's performance during training, a validation set creation and training strategy was implemented. The dataset was split into training, validation, and test datasets, with the training data used for training the model and the validation data used for selecting the best-performing model after verification using the test data. This is a common practice in model training, especially when dealing with class imbalance, as it helps to ensure that the model is not overfitting to the training data.

Furthermore, the model's training loss was plotted against the learning rate to determine the appropriate learning rate. The learning rate was fixed at the point where the plot started dipping, indicating the point at which the model began to learn effectively. This is an important step in training a model, as an inappropriate learning rate can lead to slow convergence or non-convergence of the model.

Additionally, the Fastai library was used for data pre-processing and model training. This library is built on the PyTorch framework and allows for quick analysis using its best practices. The library includes a range of tools for monitoring model performance during training, such as loss functions and accuracy metrics.

Finally, the database performance was evaluated by running a test between November 2020 and January 2021 on a GPU instance. The test evaluated the utilization, execution count, number of running statements, and number of sessions metrics. The maximum GPU utilization was under 20% even with over 1.5 million execution queries, indicating that the model was not overly resource-intensive during training.

In summary, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involved splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test datasets, plotting the training loss against the learning rate, using the Fastai library for data pre-processing and model training, and evaluating the database performance during training.
