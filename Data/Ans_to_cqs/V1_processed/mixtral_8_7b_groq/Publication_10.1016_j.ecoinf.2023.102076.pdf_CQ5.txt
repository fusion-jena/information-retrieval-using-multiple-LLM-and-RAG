The text classification pipeline discussed in the given context does not specify the use of any particular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet which are commonly used in deep learning tasks related to image classification. Instead, this pipeline focuses on addressing the challenges of imbalanced datasets and the need for large training datasets in the context of text classification.

The pipeline uses a hierarchical classification approach, where data are passed through a series of classifiers with increasingly specific relevancy criteria. At each step, irrelevant texts are filtered out and the remaining relevant texts are used to generate training data for the next classification task. The data used in this pipeline are collected from online searches, as represented in Figure 2. These data can include exploitation or sale of a particular taxa, or a randomly selected sample of collected data annotated according to researchers' own relevancy criteria.

Moreover, the pipeline uses a pretrained language model called SciBERT, which is specifically designed for scientific text. SciBERT is based on the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) architecture and was introduced in the paper "SciBERT: a pretrained language model for scientific text" by Beltagy, I., Lo, K., and Cohan, A. in 2019.

Therefore, while the pipeline does not use any of the traditional image classification datasets, it does utilize a scientific text-specific pretrained language model and collects data from online searches for text classification.
