The text provided does not give explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some implications that suggest the use of certain techniques to enhance the model's ability to generalize.

Firstly, the authors mention the use of a "diverse dataset" for training the models, which implies that they have considered a variety of data sources or types to increase the model's exposure to different patterns and variations in the data. This is an essential step towards building a generalizable model, as it helps the model to learn more robust features that can be applied to new, unseen data.

Secondly, the authors report the use of several deep learning models, including DenseNet201, EfficientNetB0, EfficientNetB3, InceptionResNetV2, and ResNet50V2. The use of multiple models can be seen as a form of ensemble learning, which can improve the model's generalizability by combining the strengths of different models. Moreover, the authors create several ensembles of these models, further enhancing the model's ability to generalize.

Thirdly, the authors report the use of performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. While these metrics do not directly relate to the model's generalizability, they provide insights into the model's performance on the training data. By monitoring these metrics, the authors can identify potential overfitting or underfitting issues and adjust the model accordingly.

Finally, the authors mention the use of pre-processing steps and an added image enhancement technique, which can help to improve the quality of the data and reduce noise or variability. This, in turn, can help the model to learn more robust features and improve its ability to generalize.

Overall, while the text does not provide explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, there are several implications that suggest the use of diverse data, ensemble learning, performance monitoring, and data pre-processing. These techniques can help to improve the model's ability to generalize and increase its performance on new, unseen data.
