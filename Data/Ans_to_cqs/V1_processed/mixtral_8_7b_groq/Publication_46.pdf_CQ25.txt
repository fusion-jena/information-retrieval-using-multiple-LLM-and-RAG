The deep learning model in question is used for the purpose of species distribution modeling. More specifically, it is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that has been proposed, designed, and tested to better predict the occurrence scenarios of a particular species, in this case, Rhododendron arboreum.

The CNN model is used to establish a nonlinear relationship between ecological and atmospheric variables, which are acquired from recent satellite missions including MODIS, Sentinel-2, Sentinel-5p, SRTM, and ECOSTRESS. These input parameters are statistically resampled and utilized to map the extracted features to the output, with the aim of improving the fit of the occurrence scenarios of the species.

The CNN model is composed of three layers or building blocks: convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers. Feature extraction is conducted using the first two layers, and mapping the extracted features to the output is conducted by the third layer. The performance of the CNN model is evaluated using the Area Under Curve (AUC) evaluation metrics, and it is found to be superior to the traditional BIOCLIM model, with an AUC value of 0.917 compared to 0.68 with BIOCLIM.

The distribution pattern of the predicted Rhododendron arboreum distribution using CNN architecture is different at some places than from conventional BIOCLIM models. However, it is observed that there is an underestimation of species distribution in CNN than BIOCLIM.

In summary, the deep learning model in question is a CNN model that is used for species distribution modeling, specifically for predicting the occurrence scenarios of Rhododendron arboreum. The model is found to be superior to the traditional BIOCLIM model in terms of its ability to establish a nonlinear relationship between ecological and atmospheric variables and map the extracted features to the output.
