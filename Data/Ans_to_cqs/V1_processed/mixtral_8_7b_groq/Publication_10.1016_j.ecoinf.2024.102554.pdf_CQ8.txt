Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the SMARTLAGOON project, which developed a tool for collecting water quality data from satellite imagery. However, it does not mention where the code for this project is hosted or whether it includes a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query.
