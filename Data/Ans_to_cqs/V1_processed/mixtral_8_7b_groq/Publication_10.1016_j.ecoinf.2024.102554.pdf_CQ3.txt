The provided context does not include information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the SMARTLAGOON project, which developed a tool for collecting water quality data from satellite remote sensing (SRS) services. The tool acquires satellite imagery from the European Space Agency (ESA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), specifically focusing on Sentinel-3 products that offer daily data with high temporal resolution. The data includes reflectance, Aerosol Optical Thickness (Kd940), and Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations, stored in NetCDF files. However, it does not mention any specific data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.
