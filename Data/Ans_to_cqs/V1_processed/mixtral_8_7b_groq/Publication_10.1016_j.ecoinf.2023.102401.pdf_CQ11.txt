I'm sorry for any inconvenience, but the provided context does not include information about the data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on describing the details of various datasets used for testing a model called YWnet and comparing it to the original YOLOv5, as well as discussing data augmentation techniques. However, there is no mention of where the data or code for this deep learning pipeline can be found or accessed. For more detailed information on the data repository, I would recommend reaching out to the authors of the study or checking the paper's citation for additional resources.
