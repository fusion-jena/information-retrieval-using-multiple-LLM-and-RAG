Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline is primarily used for processing aerial survey images. The images are saved in the 6000 Ã— 4000 pixels JPEG format, which is a commonly used format for image data. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in this pipeline. The deep learning model, HerdNet, is specifically designed for processing aerial survey images and detecting animals within those images. The image processing is done through a combination of the deep learning model and human manual interpretation steps, which forms the Semi-Automated Deep Learning (SADL) model. The SADL model is then integrated with the OCC technique (SADL-OCC) for further processing. Therefore, the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is the JPEG image format.
