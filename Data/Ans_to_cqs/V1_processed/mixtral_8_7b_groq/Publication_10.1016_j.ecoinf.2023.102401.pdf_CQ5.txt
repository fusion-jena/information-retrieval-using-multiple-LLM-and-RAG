The text provided does not give specific information about the use of standard datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention several unique datasets used to test a deep learning model called YWnet. These datasets are:

1. URPC datasets: This set includes a total of 1201 images, divided into four categories: holothurian, echinus, scallop, and starfish. The researchers used 956 images for training and 244 images for testing.

2. Aquarium: This dataset is part of the Marine Dataset and includes marine animals and waste categories. However, the specific number of images and the train-test split are not provided.

3. Trash-ICRA19: Also part of the Marine Dataset, this dataset comprises 1144 images across three categories, with 915 images for training and 229 for testing.

4. VisDrone: Selected as part of the Tiny Target Dataset, VisDrone consists of 1610 images categorized into 12 classes. The training set includes 1288 images, while the test set contains 332 images.

5. NWPU VHR-10: A small target dataset for remote sensing, NWPU VHR-10 includes 800 images with ten categories. The training and test sets consist of 640 and 160 images, respectively.

6. HRSID: Another small target dataset for remote sensing, HRSID contains 5604 images in one category. The training and test sets comprise 4483 and 1121 images, respectively.

These datasets were used to evaluate YWnet's performance in various scenarios, including marine environments and detecting tiny target objects in remote sensing.
