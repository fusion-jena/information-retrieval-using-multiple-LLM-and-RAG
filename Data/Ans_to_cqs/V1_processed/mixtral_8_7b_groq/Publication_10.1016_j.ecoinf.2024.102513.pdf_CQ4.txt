The provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss some techniques related to image processing and neural network architectures that can be relevant for data augmentation.

Data augmentation techniques are commonly applied to artificially increase the size of the training dataset and improve the model's generalization ability. These techniques include flipping, rotating, and scaling images, among others.

In the context of image processing, flipping, rotating, and scaling are geometric transformations that can be applied to images to create new variations. Flipping refers to horizontally or vertically flipping an image, while rotating involves rotating the image by a certain angle. Scaling changes the size of the image, either by zooming in (enlarging) or zooming out (shrinking). These transformations can help the model learn invariance to these geometric changes, making it more robust and better able to handle new, unseen data.

In the context of neural network architectures, the pooling layer can be used to reduce the dimensionality of the input data and extract essential features. Max pooling, the most common pooling method, selects the maximum value from a region of input data. This can help the model become more invariant to small shifts and scale changes in the input data, which is similar in spirit to the data augmentation techniques mentioned earlier.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it does discuss related concepts such as geometric transformations and the pooling layer, which can help improve the model's generalization ability and robustness to new data.
