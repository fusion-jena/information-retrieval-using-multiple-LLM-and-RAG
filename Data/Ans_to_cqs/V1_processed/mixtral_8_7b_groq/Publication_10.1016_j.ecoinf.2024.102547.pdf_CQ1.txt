While the provided context does not directly mention "deep learning pipelines," it does discuss the methods used for collecting raw data in the context of acoustic studies related to marine organisms.

In the studies discussed, the primary data collection method is through the use of scientific echosounders, a type of underwater sonar system. These echosounders are used to acquire a multifrequency acoustics dataset in the West African water and the Lake Victoria. Echosounders work by emitting sound waves into the water and recording the echoes reflected back from fish and other marine organisms. This technology allows researchers to collect high-resolution spatial and temporal data concerning marine organisms at various depths and spatial scales, all without causing any disturbance.

Additionally, the context also mentions the use of a towed multiparameter system, which is used to represent environmental conditions at a fine scale. This system likely includes various sensors that measure different environmental variables such as seawater temperature, salinity, fluorescence, and turbidity.

Another data collection method mentioned is the use of remote sensing data to predict total suspended solids concentration in the coastal zone of the Guadalquivir estuary.

In summary, the methods used for collecting raw data in the context of the provided studies include the use of scientific echosounders for acoustic data collection, a towed multiparameter system for environmental data collection, and remote sensing data for predicting suspended solids concentration. These methods can be used as a reference for data collection in deep learning pipelines related to marine organisms or environmental studies.

It's worth noting that public datasets may also be used in deep learning pipelines, but the context provided does not mention any specific public datasets used in the studies discussed.
