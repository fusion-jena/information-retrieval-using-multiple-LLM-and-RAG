The initial stage of the deep learning pipeline for biocrust monitoring involves the collection of raw data, which is primarily obtained through fieldwork and image annotation. The fieldwork consists of acquiring images of biological soil crusts, which can be done using various devices for different purposes. For instance, multispectral or hyperspectral imagery can be utilized to capture reflective properties of certain biocrust organisms in the ultraviolet and infrared spectrum. However, these methods often rely on cost-intensive airborne data acquisition.

In contrast, low-cost remote sensing biocrust monitoring is typically carried out manually over extended periods. In such cases, data acquisition methods and devices might change over time. It is crucial to consider that different camera devices record data differently due to variations in sensor construction, sensor size, resolution, device settings (such as aperture, field of view, etc.), which can impact the final output.

The pieces of context do not explicitly mention the usage of public datasets in this specific deep learning pipeline. Nonetheless, it is common practice in many deep learning projects to utilize public datasets when available and applicable.

Once the raw data is collected, the next step in the pipeline involves data processing using Python. This stage may include various preprocessing techniques, such as data cleaning, normalization, and augmentation, to enhance the quality and quantity of the data for training the deep learning model.

In summary, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for biocrust monitoring primarily involve fieldwork and image annotation, using various devices for image acquisition, such as multispectral or hyperspectral imagery devices and manual photography. Public datasets might also be used when applicable, but the provided context does not explicitly mention their usage in this particular project.
