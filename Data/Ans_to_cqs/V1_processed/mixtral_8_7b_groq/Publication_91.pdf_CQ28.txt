The provided context does not contain information about the specific platform that was used to deploy the deep learning model. The text focuses on the details of the dataset used for training the model, such as the number of images, channels, and classes, as well as the data augmentation techniques employed. It also mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the learning rate strategy, but it does not provide any details about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
