The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves several steps. First, the model's architecture is set up using a Resnet18 model, and the learner is trained using a dataset split into training and validation sets. The learner is trained for a certain number of epochs, with the number of epochs being adjustable depending on the level of detail required in the analysis. In this case, the full results were obtained after 20 epochs, but for the sake of illustration, only 2 epochs were used. The progress of the training is monitored by displaying the train and validation loss after each batch.

Additionally, a callback function is used to save the model after each epoch. This allows for the model's performance to be evaluated at any point during training, and for the training process to be resumed if necessary. The model's performance is evaluated using two metrics: accuracy and error rate. These metrics provide a quantitative measure of the model's ability to correctly classify the images in the dataset.

Furthermore, to ensure the validity of the validation set, any pictures in the validation directory for which a corresponding picture does not exist in the training directory are deleted. This step is important for maintaining the integrity of the validation set and preventing any potential data leakage from the training set.

Finally, the model's performance is presented in a table that shows the sample size (n) for the training and validation datasets. This table provides a clear and concise summary of the data used in the analysis and allows for easy comparison of the sample sizes between the two datasets.

Overall, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves a combination of visual and quantitative measures, as well as steps to ensure the validity and integrity of the datasets used in the analysis. This approach allows for thorough and accurate monitoring of the model's performance during training.
