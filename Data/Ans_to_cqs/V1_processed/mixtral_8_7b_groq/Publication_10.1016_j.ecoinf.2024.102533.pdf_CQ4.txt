The provided context does not include information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline for automated fish grading. The context mainly focuses on fish freshness classification using organoleptic parameters, clustering methods, and different machine learning algorithms. Therefore, I cannot specify the data augmentation techniques used in this particular study.

Data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset, which can help improve model performance and prevent overfitting. However, without access to the original research paper or additional context, it is not possible to accurately answer this query.
