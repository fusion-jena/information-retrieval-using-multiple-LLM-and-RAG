The provided context does not directly answer the query about the methods for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines. However, it can be inferred that satellite (S2) imagery is used in the study, as the optimization focuses on the strategic selection of predictors from S2 imagery.

In the context of the study, the raw data is likely obtained through satellite imagery, which is a common data source in remote sensing and geospatial analysis. Satellite imagery provides rich information about the Earth's surface, which can be used for various applications, including wildfire mapping.

Other possible methods for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines include:

1. Surveys: Structured or unstructured questionnaires can be used to collect data from human respondents. Surveys can be conducted online, on paper, or through face-to-face interviews.

2. Sensors: Physical sensors can be used to collect data from the environment or from objects. Examples of sensors include temperature sensors, pressure sensors, accelerometers, and GPS receivers.

3. Public datasets: Various organizations and institutions provide public datasets that can be used for research and development. Public datasets can be found in repositories such as UCI Machine Learning Repository, Kaggle, and Google Dataset Search.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods for collecting raw data, it can be inferred that satellite imagery is used in the study. Other possible methods for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines include surveys, sensors, and public datasets.
