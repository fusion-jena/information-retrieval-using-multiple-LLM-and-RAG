The provided context does not give information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. It focuses on the comparison of the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with traditional classification methods in ecological informatics, specifically for tasks like fish species classification and bluespotted ribbontail ray recognition.

The sources cited discuss the use of CNNs and other machine learning techniques, as well as the datasets and methods used for evaluation. However, they do not mention the hardware used for training these models. Common hardware resources used for training deep learning models include Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), and specialized deep learning hardware like the NVIDIA DGX system.

In summary, while the provided context offers valuable insights into the performance of CNNs in ecological informatics, it does not contain information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning models.
