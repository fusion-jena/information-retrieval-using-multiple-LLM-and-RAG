Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the specific location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. It mentions the use of Python 3, PyTorch, and specific models and training parameters, but it does not give any details about where the actual code can be found. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
