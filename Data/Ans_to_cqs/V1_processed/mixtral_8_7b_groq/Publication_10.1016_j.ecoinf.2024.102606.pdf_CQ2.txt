The text does not provide an exhaustive list of all data formats used in deep learning pipelines. However, it does mention the use of images in the context of ecological species identification using deep learning models. Specifically, it talks about the use of images in the PlantCLEF challenges, where state-of-the-art machine learning models are evaluated on a large and complex image dataset for the identification of various plant species.

In the Faster R-CNN model used for the benchmark, the input dimensions match those of the Yolov5 model and are chosen to be 640 × 640 or 1280 × 1280, indicating that this model works with image data.

Therefore, it can be inferred that image data is one format used in the deep learning pipeline. Other data formats, such as audio, video, and CSV, are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

Moreover, deep learning models can work with various data formats depending on the specific task and application. For instance, audio data might be used for speech recognition or sound analysis, video data for object detection or tracking, and CSV data for tabular data analysis or natural language processing.

In summary, while the provided context focuses on image data, deep learning models can work with various data formats, including image, audio, video, and CSV, depending on the specific application.
