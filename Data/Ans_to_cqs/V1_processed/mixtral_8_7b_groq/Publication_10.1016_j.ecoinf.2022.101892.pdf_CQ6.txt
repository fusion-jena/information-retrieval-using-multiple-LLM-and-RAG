In the context provided, several preprocessing steps are taken before training deep learning models for age estimation tasks using panda facial images.

Firstly, all images are downscaled to a resolution of 224 x 224 pixels before feeding them to the models. This step is crucial as it reduces the computational complexity of the models and helps in faster training.

Secondly, aggressive data augmentation is applied to avoid overfitting and imbalanced problems. Data augmentation techniques such as horizontal flipping are used to increase the size of the training set and provide more variability in the data. This helps the model to generalize better and perform well on unseen data.

Thirdly, to eliminate the influence of individuals, a five-fold subject-exclusive (SE) technique is applied. This technique ensures that the same subject does not appear in the training set and testing set at the same time, thereby reducing the bias towards any particular individual.

Fourthly, the models are pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, a large-scale dataset consisting of over a million images. Pre-training the models on a large dataset helps in faster convergence and better generalization.

Lastly, batch normalization (BN) is adopted to accelerate the training of networks. BN normalizes the activations of the previous layer before feeding them to the next layer, which helps in reducing the internal covariate shift and improving the stability of the model.

Therefore, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include downscaling, data augmentation, subject-exclusive technique, pre-training, and batch normalization. These steps help in reducing overfitting, improving generalization, and accelerating the training of deep learning models.
