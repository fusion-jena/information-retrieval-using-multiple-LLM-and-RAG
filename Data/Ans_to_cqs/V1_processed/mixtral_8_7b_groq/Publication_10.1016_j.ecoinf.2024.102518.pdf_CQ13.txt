Based on the provided context, the text does not discuss the use of deep learning models. Instead, it focuses on the application of species distribution models using feature classes 'L', 'Q', 'LQ', 'LQP', and a regularization multiplier. Therefore, I cannot provide information on the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, as they are not mentioned in the context.
