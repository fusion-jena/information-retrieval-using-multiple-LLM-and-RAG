Based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model mentioned, specifically neural networks, is not explicitly stated regarding its application in classification, segmentation, or detection tasks. However, it can be inferred that the deep learning model was likely used for species distribution modelling (SDM) in the studies reviewed by Pasanisi et al. (2024) and Maglietta et al. (2023).

In the context, deep learning strategies, such as neural networks and CART, were mentioned as part of machine learning techniques that experienced increased usage in SDMs. These models were likely employed to analyze and predict the distribution of species based on historical and long-term data, projecting the results into future scenarios. Furthermore, the incorporation of anthropogenic variables in the modelling process, particularly those related to fishing and boating activities, suggests that these deep learning models were used to assess the influence of human activity on species habitat use.

While the context does not explicitly mention the specific deep learning model's purpose in terms of classification, segmentation, or detection, it is evident that the deep learning models were utilized for predictive modelling in the field of ecological informatics. This information can still be valuable for those interested in modelling the distribution of cryptic species, such as the magnificent and enigmatic animals mentioned in the context, as deep learning techniques can offer insights and provide informed decisions in SDMs.
