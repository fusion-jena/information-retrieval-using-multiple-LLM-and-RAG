The context only mentions that the dataset used in the study is a pre-processed version of the PlantVillage dataset, which is a publicly available dataset for plant disease classification. However, it is not clear if the pre-processed version of the dataset used in this study is also publicly available.

The study does mention that they used an augmented version of the PlantVillage dataset, but there is no information provided on where this augmented version can be accessed. Therefore, without further information, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to the query.
