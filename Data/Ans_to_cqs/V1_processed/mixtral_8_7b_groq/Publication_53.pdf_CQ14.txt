Based on the information provided, the specific method used to optimize the hyperparameters of the deep learning model is not mentioned. The text only states that Python and the fastai library were used to develop the deep learning model, but it does not provide details about the hyperparameter optimization process.

Hyperparameter optimization is an essential step in the development of machine learning models, as it can significantly impact the model's performance. There are various methods for hyperparameter optimization, including grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and more.

Therefore, without further information, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. It would require additional information or access to the code and implementation details to provide a precise answer.
