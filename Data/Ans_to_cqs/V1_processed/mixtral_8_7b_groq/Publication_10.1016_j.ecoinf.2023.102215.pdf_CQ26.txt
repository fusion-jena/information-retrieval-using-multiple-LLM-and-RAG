The provided context does not directly discuss data bias or preprocessing techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of dilated convolutions in U2-Net to capture contextual information in different scales at a moderate level of computation cost. This could potentially help reduce data bias by ensuring that information from different scales is being considered.

Additionally, the context discusses the use of a normalization component in TA to garner global spatial information and assign weights to different channels by their significance. This could potentially help reduce data bias by ensuring that all channels are being given appropriate weight and consideration.

However, these techniques do not directly address data bias during preprocessing. Preprocessing techniques specifically used to address data bias include:

* Stratified splitting: This technique is used to ensure that each fold in a cross-validation procedure is a good representative of the whole dataset, especially when the dataset is imbalanced.
* Oversampling: This technique is used to increase the number of examples in a class with fewer examples. This can help prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.
* Undersampling: This technique is used to decrease the number of examples in a class with more examples. This can help prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.
* Diverse data collection: This technique is used to ensure that the dataset is representative of the population and includes examples from all relevant subgroups.

In summary, the provided context does not directly discuss data bias or preprocessing techniques used to address data bias. However, it does mention techniques that could potentially help reduce data bias. Preprocessing techniques specifically used to address data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.
