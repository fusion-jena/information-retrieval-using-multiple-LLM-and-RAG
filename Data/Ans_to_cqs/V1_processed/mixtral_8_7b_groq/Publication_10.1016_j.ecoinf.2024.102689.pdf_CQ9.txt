The provided context does not specify a particular data repository for the deep learning pipelines mentioned. However, there are some related works that mention the use of certain datasets.

Lahiri et al. (2011) used a dataset of field photographs to develop a biometric animal database for identifying individual zebras in the wild. The specific repository for this dataset is not mentioned. Laplante et al. (2021) used a dataset of underwater audio recordings and images for fish recognition, but the repository for this dataset is also not provided. Lei et al. (2022) developed an underwater target detection algorithm based on an improved YOLOv5 model, but the dataset used for training and testing is not specified.

Additionally, the text mentions the challenge of acquiring substantial datasets of animal images for deep learning-based individual recognition. Ferreira et al. (2020) developed a program to autonomously gather training data and generate training datasets for small bird individual recognition, but the repository for this dataset is not provided.

Therefore, while some related works have used specific datasets, the context does not provide information on a data repository for the deep learning pipelines mentioned. It is possible that the datasets used in these studies are not publicly available due to privacy or ethical concerns.
