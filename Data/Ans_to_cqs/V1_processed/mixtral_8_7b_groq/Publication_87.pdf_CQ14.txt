The provided context does not give information on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. Hyperparameter optimization is an important step in machine learning model training, where different combinations of hyperparameters are tried to find the best set of hyperparameters that yield the best model performance. Common methods for hyperparameter optimization include grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization. However, the specific method used for the model in the given context is not mentioned. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional information.
