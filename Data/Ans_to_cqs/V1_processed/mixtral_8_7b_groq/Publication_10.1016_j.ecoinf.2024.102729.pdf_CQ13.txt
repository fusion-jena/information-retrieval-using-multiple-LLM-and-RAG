Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the use of deep learning models in water quality management. The context mainly discusses the application of Random Forest (RF) models in predicting chlorophyll a concentrations and identifying associated drivers in water quality management.

However, I can provide you with some general information about hyperparameters used in deep learning models. Hyperparameters are parameters whose values are set before the learning process begins. They determine the structure of the model and the learning process. Here are some examples of hyperparameters used in deep learning models:

1. Learning rate: The learning rate determines how much an algorithm adjusts the weights of the network with respect to the loss gradient. A high learning rate may cause the model to converge too quickly to a suboptimal solution, while a low learning rate may cause the process to get stuck.
2. Optimizer: The optimizer is an algorithm that updates the weights of the network based on the gradient of the loss function. Common optimizers include stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop.
3. Number of layers: The number of layers in a deep learning model determines its depth. Increasing the number of layers can improve the model's ability to learn complex patterns but also increases the risk of overfitting.
4. Number of neurons: The number of neurons in each layer determines the capacity of the model. Increasing the number of neurons can improve the model's ability to learn complex patterns but also increases the risk of overfitting.
5. Activation function: The activation function determines the output of each neuron in the network. Common activation functions include the rectified linear unit (ReLU), sigmoid, and hyperbolic tangent (tanh).
6. Regularization: Regularization techniques, such as L1 and L2 regularization, are used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function.

Therefore, while the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in deep learning models for water quality management, these are some general hyperparameters used in deep learning models.
