Based on the provided context, there is no information given about the specific criteria used to determine when the training of the random forest (RF) model is complete. The text mainly focuses on the performance evaluation of the RF model for classifying maturity condition in Chilean hake, using metrics such as error rate, sensitivity, specificity, prevalence, Cohen's kappa coefficient, and precision.

However, it is common practice in machine learning to use validation loss plateau or convergence of validation metrics as criteria for determining when training is complete. This usually involves monitoring the performance of the model on a validation dataset during the training process. Once the validation loss or other metrics stop improving or reach a plateau, the training process is considered complete.

In the context of the provided text, it is possible that the authors used similar criteria but did not mention them explicitly. Nonetheless, without specific information, it is not possible to definitively answer the query.
