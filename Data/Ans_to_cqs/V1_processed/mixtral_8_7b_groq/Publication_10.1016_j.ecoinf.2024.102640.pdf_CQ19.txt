The deep learning model used in GreenCam for photo GVI measurement is built using the SegFormer model, which is a Transformer-based model for semantic segmentation. The SegFormer model follows an encoder-decoder structure, where the encoder is a Transformer-based model called MiT, and the decoder is a lightweight decoder called ALL-MLP. However, the context does not provide information about the specific deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) used to implement the SegFormer model in GreenCam. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional information.
