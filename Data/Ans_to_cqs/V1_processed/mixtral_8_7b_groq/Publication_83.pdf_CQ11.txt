The provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. It contains details about the methods used for classifying bird sounds using audio data, such as the use of varying length audio data, different time-frequency representations (TFRs), and a deep learning architecture called SubSpectralNet. The experimental results of classifying 43 bird species using these methods are also provided. However, there is no mention of the data repository link for this deep learning pipeline.
