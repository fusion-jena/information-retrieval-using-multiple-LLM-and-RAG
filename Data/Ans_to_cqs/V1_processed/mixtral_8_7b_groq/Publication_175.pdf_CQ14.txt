Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, such as through methods like grid search or random search. The context focuses on the comparison of model performance between different datasets, including a baseline dataset (AT0), a smaller dataset (AT1), and subsampled versions of AT0. It also mentions the use of a ResNet DL model and provides accuracy percentages for various experiments. However, the specific method used for hyperparameter optimization is not mentioned. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without making assumptions.
