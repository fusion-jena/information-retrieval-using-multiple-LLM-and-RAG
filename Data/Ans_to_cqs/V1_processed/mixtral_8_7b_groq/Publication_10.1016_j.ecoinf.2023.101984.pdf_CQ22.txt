The provided context does not give specific information about the evaluation metrics used for the deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of MaxEnt modeling for species distribution, and some studies that have been referenced for methodology and analysis.

In general, for evaluating the performance of a deep learning model, various metrics can be used, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.

Accuracy is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of input samples. Precision is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of positive predictions. Recall is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of actual positives. F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. AUC-ROC curve is a plot of the true positive rate against the false positive rate, and it measures the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes.

In the context of species distribution modeling, MaxEnt uses logistic output format, which provides the probability of presence for a species at a given location. The performance of MaxEnt models can be evaluated using partial ROC, threshold-dependent, and threshold-independent methods. Partial ROC curves are used to evaluate the model's performance at different specificity levels. Threshold-dependent methods, such as accuracy, kappa, and true skill statistic (TSS), are used to evaluate the model's performance at a specific threshold. Threshold-independent methods, such as AUC, are used to evaluate the model's overall performance.

Therefore, depending on the specific deep learning model used for species distribution, the evaluation metrics can vary. However, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC curve are commonly used metrics for evaluating the performance of deep learning models.
