Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model for detecting artisanal small-scale mining in Ghana, as described in the paper by Gallwey, Jane, Robiati, Carlo, Coggan, John, Vogt, Declan, and Eyre, Matthew (2020).

However, the paper by Couttenier, Mathieu, Di Rollo, Sebastien, Inguere, Louise, Mohand, Mathis, and Schmidt, Lukas (2022) mentions using a deep learning model for mapping artisanal and small-scale mines at large scale from space, but it does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in their model.

It is important to note that the selection of hyperparameters in a deep learning model can significantly impact its performance, and different problems may require different hyperparameters to be tuned. Commonly used hyperparameters include learning rate, number of layers, number of neurons, batch size, optimization algorithm, and regularization techniques.

Therefore, while the context provides valuable information about the use of deep learning models for detecting and mapping artisanal small-scale mining, it does not give specific details about the hyperparameters used in these models.
