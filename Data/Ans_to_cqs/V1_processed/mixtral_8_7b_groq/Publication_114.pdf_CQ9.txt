The provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the use of deep learning methods for tree species diversity mapping using high-resolution RGB images and LiDAR data. It describes the proposed three-step workflow that achieved high accuracies and can be applied to other forest regions due to on-the-fly data acquisition and processing capability. However, there is no mention of where the data or code for this pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
