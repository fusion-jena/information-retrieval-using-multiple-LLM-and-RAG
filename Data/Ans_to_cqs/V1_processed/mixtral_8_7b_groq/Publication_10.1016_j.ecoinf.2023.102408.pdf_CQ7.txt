Based on the provided context, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as train, test, and validation sets, are not explicitly mentioned. However, it is mentioned that the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model was fitted using the CARET package in R, which typically uses a resampling method for model training and evaluation.

In the context, it is mentioned that the optimum combination of parameters for the best model fit was based on accuracy. This suggests that the data was likely split into training and testing sets, where the model was trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set. The accuracy of the model on the testing set was then used to determine the optimum combination of parameters.

Furthermore, it is mentioned that the study systematically evaluated the "mtry" parameter in the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, which also suggests the use of a training and testing or validation set. The "mtry" parameter is a hyperparameter that determines the number of variables randomly selected at each node during the tree-growing process in RF. By systematically evaluating this parameter, the study aimed to strike a balance between stability and minimizing the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

Therefore, while the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not explicitly mentioned, it can be inferred that the data was likely split into training and testing or validation sets, and resampling methods were used for model training and evaluation.
