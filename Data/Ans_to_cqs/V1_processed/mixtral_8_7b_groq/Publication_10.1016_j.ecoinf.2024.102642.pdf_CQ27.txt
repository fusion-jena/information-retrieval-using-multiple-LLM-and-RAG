The text provided does not give detailed information on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that hundreds of networks were trained and compared, suggesting that some form of model serialization was used to store and load the models for comparison.

Based on the context, it can be inferred that the models were trained and evaluated on a specific dataset (SWAMS) using a hydrophone recording of underwater acoustic signals. The models were trained with consistent hyperparameters, such as batch sizes and learning rates, and were evaluated based on their performance in identifying SEIO PBW vocalizations.

The text also mentions two annotation aggregation methods, majority voting and soft labeling, which were proposed and tested to improve model performance and reduce variability. These methods could potentially be implemented during the deployment phase to further optimize the model's performance.

In terms of platform selection, the text does not provide any information on where or how the model was deployed. It is possible that the model was deployed on a local machine for testing and comparison purposes, but further information is needed to confirm this.

In summary, while the text provides some information on the training and evaluation of the deep learning model, it does not give explicit details on the model serialization or platform selection process. It can be inferred that some form of model serialization was used, and that the model was trained and evaluated on a specific dataset using consistent hyperparameters. Additionally, two annotation aggregation methods were proposed and tested to improve model performance. However, further information is needed to confirm the specifics of the model deployment process.
