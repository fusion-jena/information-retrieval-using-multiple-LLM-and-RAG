The deep learning model in the study described is used for classification. Specifically, it is designed to identify calls of the southern black-throated finch, a threatened species, from audio recordings.

The model is built using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), more specifically, ResNet-50 architecture. The CNN model is developed within an active learning framework, which involves iteratively training and improving the model. At each iteration, the model is trained on a combination of target (i.e., calls of the southern black-throated finch) and non-target (i.e., other sounds) audio frames. The number of audio frames used in each iteration varies, as shown in Table 1.

The model's performance is evaluated using a test dataset, which is separate from the training and validation datasets. However, the specific details of the test dataset, such as its size and composition, are not provided in the context.

The study's focus is on demonstrating the efficacy of active learning as a framework for building deep learning models in a setting where limited training data are available, and the cost to obtain training data is high. The authors show that their open-access active learning method can successfully develop a call recognizer for a rare and difficult-to-survey species, such as the southern black-throated finch, by considering imbalanced and unlabelled data and ambiguous vocalisations.

Therefore, the deep learning model in this study is used for classification, specifically for identifying calls of a threatened species from audio recordings. The model is developed within an active learning framework, and its performance is evaluated using a test dataset.
