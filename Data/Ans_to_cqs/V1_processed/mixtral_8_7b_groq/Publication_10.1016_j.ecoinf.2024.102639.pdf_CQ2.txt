Based on the provided context, the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline for animal behavior studies are not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that the data formats could include CSV files or similar structured data formats, as the study refers to the use of machine learning algorithms like SVM and KNN that typically handle structured data.

Moreover, the context highlights the use of confusion matrices in the analysis of zebrafish and rat behavior, which are often generated based on the predicted and actual categorical labels of data points, further suggesting the use of structured data formats.

Nonetheless, the study does not exclude the possibility of using other data formats such as images, audio, or video, as deep learning techniques have been traditionally renowned for their predictive accuracy in fields like image processing and neuroscience.

Therefore, while the specific data formats are not explicitly stated, it can be concluded that the deep learning pipeline in animal behavior studies could include various data formats such as CSV, images, audio, or video.
