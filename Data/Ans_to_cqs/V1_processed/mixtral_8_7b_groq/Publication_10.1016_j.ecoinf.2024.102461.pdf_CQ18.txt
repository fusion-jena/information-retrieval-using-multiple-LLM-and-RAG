Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The text focuses on the methodology of fire risk mapping using Landsat 8 imagery and vegetation indices, the validation of the accuracy of fire risk maps, and the results and discussion of the study.

However, the study does mention the use of the Jenks Natural Breaks classification method in ArcGIS 10.6 to categorize fire risk maps into four classes with different susceptibility levels. This method aims to maximize the organization of a given set of values into distinct and meaningful classes, minimizing the variance within classes while simultaneously maximizing the variance across types. This suggests that the model's performance may be evaluated based on the accuracy of its classifications.

Additionally, the study presents tables and figures that show the distribution of forest fires in the study area by months in 2021, as well as burnt areas in hectares and numbers of forest fires according to vegetation indices. These visualizations could be used to monitor the model's performance by comparing the predicted fire risk with the actual occurrences of forest fires.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy used to monitor the model performance during training, it can be inferred that the accuracy of the model's classifications and comparisons with actual fire occurrences may be used to evaluate its performance.
