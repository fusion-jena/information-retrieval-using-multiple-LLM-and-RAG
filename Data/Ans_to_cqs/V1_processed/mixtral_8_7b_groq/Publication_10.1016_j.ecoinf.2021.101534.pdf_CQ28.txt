Based on the provided context, there is no information that specifies the platform used to deploy the deep learning models. The sources mention various deep learning models and applications in ecological informatics, soundscape recordings, and species identification, but they do not provide details about the deployment platforms. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query.
