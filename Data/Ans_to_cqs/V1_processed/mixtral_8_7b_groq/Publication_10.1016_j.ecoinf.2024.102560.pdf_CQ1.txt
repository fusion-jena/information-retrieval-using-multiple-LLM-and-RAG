The provided context discusses two main methods for collecting raw data in the studies of environmental conditions: the Climate Prediction Center (CMAP) and Landsat satellite datasets, as well as Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images.

The CMAP is a collection of precipitation datasets that can be produced by analyzing gauge data and estimating satellite-based precipitation. The spatial resolution of the CMAP is 2.5 degrees, and its temporal resolution is monthly. The data of CMAP can be downloaded from the NOAA repository.

Landsat satellite datasets were used to investigate water surface area and salinity variations over a long period of time (i.e. 1985 to 2020). For this aim, the most suitable data in terms of identifiability (i.e. frames with cloud cover <10%) was selected. It takes eight “Landsat frames” to cover the entire Urmia Lake basin. In the present study, 150 images from 1985 to 2020 were used to assess land cover variations in the selected basin. To minimize the radiometric effects, radiometric calibration was done for the selected images.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images. This method mainly uses UAV-carried spectrometers to collect near-map images. High-precision remote sensing images can be obtained in small areas, and ground information can be analyzed accurately.

Therefore, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline in the provided context are the Climate Prediction Center (CMAP), Landsat satellite datasets, and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images.
