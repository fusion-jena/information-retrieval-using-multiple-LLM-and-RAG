The provided context does not contain information about data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query. However, I can provide some general information about data annotation techniques that are commonly used in deep learning.

Data annotation is the process of labeling data so that it can be used to train machine learning models. In the context of deep learning, data annotation is a critical step in the development of computer vision models, such as object detection and semantic segmentation models.

Some common data annotation techniques used in deep learning include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing a bounding box around an object of interest in an image. The bounding box is defined by its coordinates in the image, and it provides a simple way to label objects in an image. Bounding box annotation is commonly used for object detection tasks, where the goal is to identify the location and class of objects in an image.
2. Instance segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image with its corresponding class. Instance segmentation is more complex than bounding box annotation because it requires labeling each instance of an object in an image. Instance segmentation is commonly used for tasks such as image segmentation, where the goal is to identify the different regions of an image.
3. Semantic segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image with its corresponding semantic class. Semantic segmentation is similar to instance segmentation, but it does not differentiate between different instances of the same class. Semantic segmentation is commonly used for tasks such as scene understanding, where the goal is to identify the different objects and regions in an image.
4. Keypoint annotation: This technique involves labeling specific points of interest in an image, such as the joints of a human body. Keypoint annotation is commonly used for tasks such as human pose estimation, where the goal is to identify the position and orientation of a human body in an image.

These are some of the common data annotation techniques used in deep learning. The choice of data annotation technique depends on the specific task and the type of data being used.
