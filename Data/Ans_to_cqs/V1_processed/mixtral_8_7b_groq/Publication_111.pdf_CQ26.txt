The provided context discusses various aspects of deep learning and machine learning models, including data preprocessing, model training, and hyperparameter tuning. However, it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, based on the given information, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.

However, I can mention some common techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing stage in machine learning and deep learning:

1. Stratified sampling: Stratified sampling is a method of sampling that ensures each stratum or subset of the population is proportionally represented in the sample. This technique can help reduce bias when the data is not uniformly distributed across different classes or categories.

2. Oversampling: Oversampling is a technique used to increase the representation of the minority class in the dataset. This can help reduce bias and improve model performance for imbalanced datasets.

3. Undersampling: Undersampling is a technique used to decrease the representation of the majority class in the dataset. This can help reduce bias and improve model performance for imbalanced datasets.

4. Diverse data collection: Collecting data from various sources and ensuring diversity in the dataset can help reduce bias and improve model performance. This includes collecting data from different geographical locations, demographic groups, and time periods.

5. Data augmentation: Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the size of the dataset by applying transformations to the existing data. This can help reduce overfitting and improve model performance, especially for small datasets.

6. Re-weighting: Re-weighting is a technique used to adjust the weights of different classes or samples in the dataset. This can help reduce bias and improve model performance for imbalanced datasets.

While the provided context does not mention these techniques explicitly, they are commonly used in the preprocessing stage of deep learning pipelines to address data bias.
