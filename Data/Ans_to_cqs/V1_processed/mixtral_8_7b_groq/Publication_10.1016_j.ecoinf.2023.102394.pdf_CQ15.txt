The provided context discusses the use of a deep learning algorithm, specifically the multilayer perceptron (MLP), in modeling the relationship between soil organic carbon stock (SOCS) and environmental covariates. However, it does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

Optimization techniques are crucial in training deep learning models as they help to minimize the loss function and improve the model's performance. Some commonly used optimization techniques in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad.

SGD is a simple optimization technique that updates the model's weights based on the gradient of the loss function. However, it may not always converge to the optimal solution due to its simplicity.

Adam, which stands for Adaptive Moment Estimation, is a more advanced optimization technique that combines the advantages of SGD and other optimization methods. It calculates the adaptive learning rate for each parameter by considering the exponentially decaying average of past gradients and squared gradients.

The context does not provide enough information to determine whether SGD, Adam, or any other optimization technique was used in the deep learning pipeline for SOCS modeling. Therefore, we cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based on the given information.

In summary, while the provided context discusses the use of deep learning in SOCS modeling, it does not specify the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, we cannot answer this query without additional information.
