The provided context does not contain information about the specific regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline for bird call detection. However, it does mention the use of machine learning and convolutional neural networks in future studies to reduce the number of misclassified sounds. Regularization methods like dropout and L2 regularization are commonly used in deep learning to prevent overfitting.

Dropout is a regularization technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to prevent over-dependence on any single neuron and therefore reduces overfitting. L2 regularization, on the other hand, adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This encourages the model to have smaller weights, which can help to reduce overfitting by preventing the model from learning overly complex patterns in the training data.

Therefore, while the specific regularization methods used in the bird call detection pipeline are not mentioned in the provided context, it is reasonable to assume that regularization techniques like dropout and L2 regularization could be used to prevent overfitting.
