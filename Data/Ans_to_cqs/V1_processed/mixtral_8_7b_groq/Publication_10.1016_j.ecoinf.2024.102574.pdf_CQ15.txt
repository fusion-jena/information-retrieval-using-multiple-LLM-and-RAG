The provided context does not contain specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for the study of understory terrain using RGB cameras. However, it does mention the use of deep learning in estimating aboveground biomass (AGB) and creating digital terrain models (DTMs) using LiDAR and UAV points clouds.

In general, deep learning models use optimization algorithms to minimize the difference between predicted and actual values, which is called the loss function. Some commonly used optimization techniques include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), and Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSprop).

For instance, in the study by Liu et al. (2022), they used a neural network to guide the interpolation of canopy height for China's forests by integrating GEDI and ICESat-2 data. Although the specific optimization technique used in their study is not mentioned, it is likely that they used one of the aforementioned techniques.

Therefore, while the provided context does not give a direct answer to the query, it can be inferred that optimization techniques such as SGD, Adam, or RMSprop are commonly used in deep learning pipelines for remote sensing and geospatial applications.
