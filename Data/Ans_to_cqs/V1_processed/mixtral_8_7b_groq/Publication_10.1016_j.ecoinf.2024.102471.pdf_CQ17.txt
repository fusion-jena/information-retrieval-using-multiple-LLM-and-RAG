Regularization methods are used in the deep learning pipeline to prevent overfitting, which occurs when a model learns the training data too well and performs poorly on unseen data. Common regularization methods include dropout, L2 regularization, and diversity loss. In the Wav2Vec model, diversity loss is used during the pre-training phase for regularization. This loss is added to the objective function to encourage the model to learn a more diverse representation of the data. However, the text does not mention the use of dropout or L2 regularization in the Wav2Vec model.
