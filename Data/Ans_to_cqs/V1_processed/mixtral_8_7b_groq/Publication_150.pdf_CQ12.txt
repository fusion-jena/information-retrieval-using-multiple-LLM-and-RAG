The type of deep learning models used in the pipeline mentioned in the context are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This is evident from the names and descriptions of the models used, such as ResNet-101, Wide-ResNet, InceptionV3, and MnasNet-A1. These models are all variations of CNNs, which are widely used in computer vision tasks for image classification, object detection, and other tasks. CNNs are designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from images, making them well-suited for image-based tasks. The context provides details about the training of these models, including the use of the SGD optimizer, batch normalization, and the number of epochs, but it does not provide information about the specific dataset or task the models were trained on. Nonetheless, the use of CNNs is clear from the models and training details provided.
