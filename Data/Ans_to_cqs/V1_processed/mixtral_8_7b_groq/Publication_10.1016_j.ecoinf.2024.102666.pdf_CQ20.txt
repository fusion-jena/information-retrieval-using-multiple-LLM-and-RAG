The provided context does not include specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It mainly discusses the use of different sensors, satellite images, and atmospheric correction techniques for water quality monitoring and remote sensing applications.

However, it can be inferred that given the complexity of deep learning models and the large datasets typically involved in their training, powerful hardware accelerators such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) are likely used to reduce training times and improve computational efficiency. These hardware resources are well-suited for parallel processing, which is essential for handling the high-dimensional data and numerous computations involved in deep learning model training.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, it is reasonable to assume that GPUs or TPUs are utilized to enhance computational performance and efficiency.
