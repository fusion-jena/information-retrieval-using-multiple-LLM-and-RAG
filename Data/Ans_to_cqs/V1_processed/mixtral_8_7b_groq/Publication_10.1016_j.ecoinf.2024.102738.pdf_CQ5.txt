The provided context does not include information about the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does provide information about a land use and land cover (LULC) classification study using remote sensing data and the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform.

In this study, the authors used LULC classes based on the Corine Land Cover (CLC) methodology, which includes six thematic classes: Artificial surfaces, Agricultural areas, Forest, Scrub and/or herbaceous vegetation, Open spaces with little or no vegetation, and Water bodies. The study used 14 Sentinel-2 Level-1C datasets, which were preprocessed and then used to calculate spectral indices such as NDVI, EVI, SAVI, BSI, MNDWI, and NDMI. These indices were calculated for each collection, resulting in a total of 16 datasets.

Additionally, the study used a simplified random sampling strategy to select training areas for the LULC classification. At least 50 pixels per thematic class were included in the training areas, which were selected using Table 3, which provides the class, description, code, and RGB color for each LULC class.

Therefore, while the provided context does not include information about the specific deep learning datasets used in the study, it does provide information about the datasets used for the LULC classification and the preprocessing steps taken to prepare the data for analysis.
