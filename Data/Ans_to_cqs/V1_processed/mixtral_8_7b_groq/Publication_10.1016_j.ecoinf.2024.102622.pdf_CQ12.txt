The provided context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it does mention the use of machine learning models such as Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGboost), and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) in the study by Chai and Draxler (2014). These models are not deep learning models, but rather traditional machine learning algorithms.

Moreover, the context mentions the use of a cascaded ensemble of machine learning models for crop type classification using multi-temporal Sentinel-1/2 and Landsat-8/9 remote sensing data. Again, these models are not deep learning models.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it appears that deep learning models are not used in the pipeline. However, it is important to note that the context does not provide a comprehensive description of the entire pipeline, and it is possible that deep learning models are used in other parts of the pipeline that are not mentioned in the provided context.

In summary, the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of deep learning models in the pipeline. Instead, it mentions the use of traditional machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Multi-layer Perceptron, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Multiple Linear Regression.
