Based on the provided context, the deep learning model in question is used for object detection, specifically for detecting fish in underwater images. The model is called LigObNet, and it is compared with other detection models such as YOLOv5, YOLOv6, YOLOv7, and YOLOv8. These models are trained across four scales (n, s, m, and l) to investigate the relationship between the number of parameters, computation, detection speed, and hardware configuration demands. The experiments are conducted on a Windows 10-based mobile laptop with an Intel(R) i7-11800H CPU and a GeForce RTX3080 GPU with 16GB of video memory. The PyCharm software platform is utilized, employing Python 3.8 and the Pytorch 1.9 deep learning framework for training purposes. The study establishes detection thresholds of IoU = 0.3 and score = 0.3, indicating that a bounding box with a likelihood of containing a fish of 30% or higher is considered valid and retained. The purpose of the LigObNet model and the other YOLO models is to detect fish in underwater images accurately and efficiently.
