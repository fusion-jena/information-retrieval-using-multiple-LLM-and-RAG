The provided context discusses the use of deep learning models for image classification, specifically using the AlexNet architecture. Therefore, it directly mentions the use of image data in the deep learning pipeline.

In the context, the authors performed image classification experiments on a small-size dataset without data augmentation. They used the AlexNet CNN architecture, which consists of eight layers, including five convolutional layers and three fully connected layers. These layers extract features from the input image data and pass them through rectified linear units (ReLUs) for non-linearity.

The authors trained the model using stochastic gradient descent and the backpropagation algorithm included in Caffe. They initialized all feature extractors with white Gaussian noise and learned from the data. The learning rate policy was set to "step," with the learning rate set to 10-2 for all layers initially.

Therefore, the provided context indicates that image data is used in the deep learning pipeline for image classification tasks. However, it does not explicitly mention other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV.

To further support the answer, we can refer to other sources. For instance, Lecun (2013) provides a tutorial on deep learning, which covers various types of data formats used in deep learning. Lecun et al. (1998) discuss the application of gradient-based learning to document recognition, which involves processing scanned documents as image data. Liu et al. (2008) present a method for automatic insect identification based on color characters, which involves processing image data. Martineau et al. (2017) survey various image-based insect recognition methods, which also involve processing image data.

In summary, the provided context indicates that image data is used in the deep learning pipeline for image classification tasks. Other sources also support the use of various data formats in deep learning, including image, audio, video, and CSV.
