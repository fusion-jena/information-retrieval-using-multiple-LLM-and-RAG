The text provided does not give explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some implicit indications that suggest certain techniques might have been used.

Firstly, the "VnPollenBee dataset" is mentioned, but there is no information about its diversity or how it was collected. If the dataset is diverse, representing various scenarios, lighting conditions, bee types, and environments, it could help improve the model's generalizability.

Secondly, the text mentions "Baseline methods" and "Our proposed methods," implying that some form of comparison was made. If these methods were tested on different subsets of the data or on separate datasets, this could indicate some form of cross-validation or splitting, which can contribute to the model's generalizability.

However, the text does not explicitly mention techniques such as cross-validation, stratified splitting, or data augmentation, which are commonly used to ensure the generalizability of deep learning models. Therefore, without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
