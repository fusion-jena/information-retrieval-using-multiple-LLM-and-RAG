The provided context does not give specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning models, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The focus of the text is on the development of new deep learning networks for underwater fish video processing in turbid waters, and the creation of a weakly-labeled fish dataset for this purpose. The two models developed are a semi-supervised model using contrastive learning for accelerated model deployment time, and a weakly-supervised model for shorter development time while maintaining high accuracy. The specific hyperparameters used in these models are not mentioned.
