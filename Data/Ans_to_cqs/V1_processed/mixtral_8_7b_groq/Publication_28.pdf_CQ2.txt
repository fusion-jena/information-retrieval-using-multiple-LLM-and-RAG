The provided context discusses the use of remote sensing data, specifically satellite images, in deep learning pipelines for image classification tasks. There is no explicit mention of other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV.

Lunga et al. (2020) presented a new remote sensing data flow (RESFlow) to handle huge amounts of remotely sensed images for an advanced machine learning (ML) model. Nguyen et al. (2020) proposed a new multi-temporal high spatial resolution classification technique using a spatio-temporal spectral deep neural network (DNN) for locating paddy fields at the pixel level for an entire year and temporal instances. Boulila et al. (2021) proposed a new distributed DL-based method for classifying big remote sensing images using a residual spatio-temporal deep convolutional neural network (RS-DCNN).

These studies emphasize the use of satellite images as the primary data format in their deep learning pipelines. The preprocessing and preparation of these images for the deep learning models may involve various steps, such as data augmentation, normalization, and splitting into training, validation, and testing sets. However, the context does not provide information on other data formats being used in conjunction with satellite images or as standalone data formats in the deep learning pipelines.

In summary, the provided context focuses on the use of satellite images as the data format in deep learning pipelines for remote sensing image classification tasks. There is no mention of other data formats, such as audio, video, or CSV, being used in these pipelines.
