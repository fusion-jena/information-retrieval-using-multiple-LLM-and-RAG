The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the context provided, which mentions the use of a ResNet-34 model for the CNN architecture. ResNet models are a type of CNN that have proven to be highly effective in image and audio recognition tasks. Furthermore, the paper by Sankupellay and Konovalov (2018) specifically mentions the use of a deep convolutional neural network (ResNet-50) for bird call recognition. Therefore, it can be concluded that the pipeline described in the context uses a CNN for identifying calls of the southern black-throated finch.
