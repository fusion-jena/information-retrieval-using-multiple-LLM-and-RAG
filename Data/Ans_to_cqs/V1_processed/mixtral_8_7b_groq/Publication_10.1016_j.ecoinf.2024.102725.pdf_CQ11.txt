Based on the provided context, there is no direct link to a data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. However, the study does mention using the Google Earth Engine platform to obtain MCD43A4 V6.1 data for satellite path h27v06, spanning October 29, 2022, to December 20, 2022. The data access link for this is: <https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/MODIS_061_MCD43A4>, accessed on May 1, 2023.

The study also mentions fusing optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images based on deep learning to reconstruct vegetation NDVI time series in cloud-prone regions (Li et al., 2022). However, the specific deep learning pipeline or code repository is not provided in the context.

In addition, there are other studies mentioned that use deep learning for remote sensing and NDVI reconstruction, such as Bermudez et al., 2018; Mao et al., 2023; and Pipia et al., 2019. However, these studies do not provide a direct link to a data repository for their deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, while the data used in the study is accessible through the provided link, the specific deep learning pipeline or code repository is not provided in the context.
