The provided context discusses various techniques and methods used in machine learning and deep learning models, particularly in the context of predicting carbon stocks and biomass. However, it does not explicitly mention the data bias reduction techniques during the preprocessing phase of the deep learning pipeline.

In general, data bias reduction techniques during preprocessing include:

1. Stratified splitting: This method involves dividing the data into subgroups based on specific criteria, ensuring that each subset has a similar distribution of classes. This helps maintain balance and avoid bias in the training and testing datasets.
2. Oversampling: In cases where one class is underrepresented, oversampling can be used to increase the number of instances from that class, ensuring a more balanced dataset.
3. Undersampling: Conversely, if one class is overrepresented, undersampling can be used to reduce the number of instances from that class, again leading to a more balanced dataset.
4. Diverse data collection: Collecting data from various sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the entire population can help minimize bias.

While these techniques are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, there are some related concepts discussed that can help in addressing data bias:

1. Grid search method: This technique is used for hyperparameter tuning, ensuring that the model is optimized for the given dataset. Properly tuned hyperparameters can help reduce bias and improve model performance.
2. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost): XGBoost is a powerful machine learning algorithm known for its ability to minimize bias error within and between spectral predictors. By building sequential models and adjusting the weights of weak and strong learners, XGBoost can help reduce bias and improve model accuracy.
3. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs): ANNs, such as Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Networks (MLPNNs), can help address data bias by iteratively adjusting connection weights during the training phase. This process continues until a target minimal error is reached, ensuring that the model accurately estimates carbon stocks for both training and new input data.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not explicitly mention data bias reduction techniques during preprocessing, it does discuss related methods that can help address data bias, such as grid search, XGBoost, and ANNs. However, for a more comprehensive answer, additional resources discussing deep learning preprocessing techniques should be consulted.
