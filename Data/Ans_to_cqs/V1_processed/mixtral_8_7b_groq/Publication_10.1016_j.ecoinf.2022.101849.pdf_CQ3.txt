The provided context does not directly discuss data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention weakly supervised learning, which is a type of machine learning that uses limited or noisy label information.

In the context of deep learning, data annotation techniques are often used to provide label information for supervised learning. Some common examples include:

1. Image classification: Each image is assigned a single label corresponding to the object or scene depicted in the image.
2. Object detection: Bounding boxes are drawn around objects of interest in an image, and each bounding box is assigned a label corresponding to the object it contains.
3. Semantic segmentation: Pixel-level labels are assigned to each pixel in an image, indicating the object or class it belongs to.
4. Instance segmentation: Similar to semantic segmentation, but each instance of an object is assigned a unique label, allowing for differentiation between multiple objects of the same class.

In weakly supervised learning, these annotation techniques may not be used, or they may be used in a limited or noisy way. For example, in the case of image classification, only a subset of images may be labeled, or the labels may be noisy or incorrect. In the case of object detection, only a subset of objects may be annotated with bounding boxes, or the bounding boxes may be imprecise.

The context mentions partial multi-label learning, which is a type of weakly supervised learning where each instance may be associated with a subset of possible labels. This approach could be used in conjunction with the aforementioned annotation techniques, where each instance is assigned a subset of relevant labels, rather than a single label.

Overall, while the provided context does not directly discuss data annotation techniques in deep learning, it does provide some insight into how weakly supervised learning approaches can be used in conjunction with these techniques to handle limited or noisy label information.
