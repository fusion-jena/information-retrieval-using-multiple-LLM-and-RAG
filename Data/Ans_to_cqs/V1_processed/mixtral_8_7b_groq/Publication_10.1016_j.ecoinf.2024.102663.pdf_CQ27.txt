Based on the provided context, the process of deploying the trained deep learning model involves several steps, although the text does not explicitly mention "model serialization" or "platform selection."

Firstly, the deep learning techniques are applied to the pre-processing of the dataset to address unique challenges, such as low light, extreme occlusion, or overlapping of fish. This step could include tailoring datasets to specific use cases and training deep learning models on these datasets.

Secondly, the architecture of deep learning models is modified to better suit specific requirements. For instance, incorporating Bidirectional LSTM with GloVe embeddings could enhance the detection and classification of fish species within the dataset, capturing contextual and semantic information that improves the accuracy of fish biomass estimates. Additionally, altering various parts of the architecture, such as YOLO, can handle different environmental factors, such as salinity, which affect fish biomass.

Thirdly, the training of the deep learning model involves several hyperparameter tuning experiments, such as comparing the number of epochs (Fig. 13), final learning rate (Fig. 16), cos_lr (Fig. 14), optimizer (Fig. 17), and initial learning rate (Fig. 15). These experiments aim to optimize the model's performance.

Lastly, although not explicitly mentioned, model serialization and platform selection are critical steps in deploying a deep learning model. Model serialization involves saving the trained model to a file, allowing it to be loaded and used for making predictions. Platform selection refers to choosing the hardware and software environment where the model will be deployed, such as a local machine, cloud server, or edge device.

Therefore, while the text does not explicitly mention model serialization and platform selection, we can infer that these steps are part of the process, following the training and hyperparameter tuning of the deep learning model.
