Unfortunately, there is no information provided in the given context about a code repository for a deep learning pipeline. The context discusses various studies and methods related to detecting and tracking animals using acoustic recordings, but it does not mention any deep learning models or code repositories. Therefore, I cannot provide the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline.
