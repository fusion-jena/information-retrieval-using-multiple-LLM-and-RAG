The provided context does not describe a deep learning pipeline that uses standard datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it describes a three-layer backpropagation artificial neural network (ANN) model for predicting Trophic State Index (TSI) using a specific set of water samples.

The water samples are classified into four trophic states: mesotrophic, light-eutrophic, middle-eutrophic, and hypereutrophic. The ANN model uses two input variables, aCDOM(254) and Fn(355), and one output variable, TSI. The model is trained using 64 water samples and validated using the remaining samples. The validation accuracy is assessed by calculating the coefficient of determination (R2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) between the measured and predicted TSI.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are the water samples collected from Plateau Lakes in Southwest China, which are classified by trophic state and have corresponding measurements of aCDOM(254), Fn(355), and TSI.
