The query asks about the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, but the provided context does not mention any deep learning methods or datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the article describes a machine learning ensemble approach used to predict Short-billed Gull abundance hotspots and coldspots.

The machine learning ensemble in this study consists of four algorithms: RandomForest, Treenet, CART, and MARS. These algorithms were trained and tested using a combined 2014-2015 Short-billed Gull presence/absence dataset. Additionally, the models were built on an information system (GIS) platform with 68 open-access predictor layers, including socio-economic U.S. Census data.

The socio-economic data includes variables such as population density, race, ethnicity, household income, and housing characteristics. These variables are provided at the census block level and include information from the year 2000. The GIS platform also includes geographic information such as x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and polygon area.

While these datasets are not from the typical deep learning image classification domain, they are still valuable for the machine learning ensemble approach used in this study. The combination of the Short-billed Gull presence/absence data and the socio-economic and geographic data allows for the prediction of gull abundance hotspots and coldspots.

In summary, the datasets used in the machine learning pipeline described in the article include the 2014-2015 Short-billed Gull presence/absence dataset, 68 open-access predictor layers of socio-economic U.S. Census data, and geographic information from a GIS platform. However, the article does not mention any deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
