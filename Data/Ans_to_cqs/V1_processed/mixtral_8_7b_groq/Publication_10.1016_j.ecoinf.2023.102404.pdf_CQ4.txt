Based on the provided context, there is no specific mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling in the deep learning pipelines discussed in the papers. However, the paper "Comparison of machine and deep learning methods to estimate shrub willow biomass from UAS imagery" does mention the use of data augmentation, but it does not specify the techniques used.

Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the size of the training dataset by applying various transformations to the existing data. This can help improve the model's performance by providing more diverse data for training. Some common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, and cropping.

In the paper "Neural network guided interpolation for mapping canopy height of Chinaâ€™s forests by integrating GEDI and ICESat-2 data", the authors used a neural network to interpolate canopy height data. While they mention the use of data preprocessing techniques such as outlier detection and removal, they do not mention any data augmentation techniques.

The paper "Deep learning in remote sensing applications: a Meta-analysis and review" provides a comprehensive review of deep learning applications in remote sensing. However, it does not specifically mention data augmentation techniques in the context of deep learning pipelines.

In the paper "Dual Polarimetric radar vegetation index for crop growth monitoring using Sentinel-1 SAR data", the authors proposed a new vegetation index for crop growth monitoring using Sentinel-1 SAR data. While they mention the use of data preprocessing techniques such as noise removal and speckle filtering, they do not mention any data augmentation techniques.

The paper "Google earth engine for geo-big data applications: a meta-analysis and systematic review" provides a meta-analysis of the use of Google Earth Engine for geo-big data applications. While they mention the use of data preprocessing techniques such as data fusion and normalization, they do not mention any data augmentation techniques.

Therefore, while data augmentation is a common technique used in deep learning pipelines, it is not specifically mentioned in the papers provided in the context.
