The provided context does not give information about the use of deep learning pipelines or specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it focuses on the analysis of the urban acoustic environment (AE) using fuzzy c-means (FCM) and complex network representations. The datasets used in this study consist of power spectra from the urban AE, specifically from two land use types: Commercial Area and Urban Forest. These datasets were analyzed using Python 3.8.5 and corresponding packages, with the code and a demo dataset available on GitHub. The results include the diel cycle of average shortest path length (ASPL) for each land use type and 95% Bootstrap intervals of ASPL for each hour by device. Therefore, the study does not involve deep learning pipelines or the datasets typically used in such contexts.
