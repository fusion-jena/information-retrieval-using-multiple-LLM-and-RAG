I'm sorry for any confusion, but the context provided does not include information about the deep learning pipeline or any datasets commonly used in deep learning, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.

The context focuses on a specific study related to vegetation change in the Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River (MRB) using the MOD13A2 Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) dataset from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Additionally, the study considers 12 drivers of climate, terrain, and human activity, which were derived from various sources and processed using ArcGIS Pro 3.0.2.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
