The provided context discusses a study that uses ResNet architectures to classify objects in underwater video footage, but it does not explicitly mention saliency maps or confusion matrices as post-processing steps. However, it does mention the calculation of metrics such as Top-1 accuracy and macro- and micro-F1 scores.

In addition, the study mentions the use of the Selective Gradient Reversal (SGR) algorithm as a post-processing step. The SGR algorithm provides accurate thresholds that allow the user to filter predictions that meet a required level of error. This filtered set of predictions consistently had a top-5 accuracy of over 80% on the test set, regardless of the desired risk specified for input into the SGR algorithm. This top-5 accuracy could then be used to create a tool to enable an expert to quickly annotate the rejected data.

The study also suggests that this post-processing step could be useful for mitigating the limited accuracy of human annotation, which in turn affects performance in the classification task. This is particularly relevant given the fine-grained nature of the classification task.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention saliency maps or confusion matrices, it does mention the calculation of metrics and the use of the SGR algorithm as post-processing steps.
