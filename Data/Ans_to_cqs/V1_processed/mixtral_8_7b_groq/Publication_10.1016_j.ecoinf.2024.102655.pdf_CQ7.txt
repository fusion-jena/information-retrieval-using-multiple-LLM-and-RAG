Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, it does mention the importance of historical trends and variation in water quality datasets when developing predictive models. It also highlights the potential issue of overtraining when using larger datasets.

Taking these points into consideration, one possible approach to splitting the data could be to use historical trends to identify the most variable and representative scenarios in the dataset. This subset of data could then be used as the training set for the deep learning model. The remaining data could be split into a test set and a validation set, with the test set used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data and the validation set used to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters.

Another approach could be to use a time-series split, where the data is split into training, test, and validation sets based on the time order of the data points. This approach is useful when dealing with time-dependent data, as it ensures that the model is trained on data that is earlier in time than the test and validation sets.

Ultimately, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training will depend on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the problem at hand. It is important to carefully consider these factors when deciding on the split strategy, as it can have a significant impact on the model's performance.
