Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it is mentioned that the study used the U-net model to identify Hedychium Coronarium, an invasive vegetation species for the Brazilian natural flora.

In general, there are several strategies that can be used to monitor model performance during training, such as:

1. Validation set: A portion of the training data is set aside as a validation set, and the model's performance is evaluated on this set after each epoch of training. This helps to identify if the model is overfitting or underfitting the training data.
2. Learning curve: The model's performance is plotted against the number of training examples to visualize how the model's performance improves as more data is seen. A well-fit model will have a learning curve that eventually plateaus.
3. Regularization: Techniques such as dropout, weight decay, or early stopping can be used to prevent overfitting and improve generalization. These techniques can be monitored during training to ensure that they are effectively preventing overfitting.
4. Loss function: The loss function measures the difference between the model's predictions and the true labels. Monitoring the loss function during training can help to identify if the model is improving or getting worse.

Without more specific information from the context, it is difficult to say which of these strategies (if any) were used in this study. However, it is mentioned that the results achieved an F1 score of 0.9034 and a Jaccard index of 0.8287 on the test set, which suggests that the model's performance was well-evaluated.
