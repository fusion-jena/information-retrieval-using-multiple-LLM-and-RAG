Based on the provided context, the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model are not explicitly mentioned. However, it is mentioned that TensorFlow 2.5.0 libraries were used for training the model, and TensorFlow is a popular open-source platform for machine learning and deep learning that can run on various hardware, including CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs (Tensor Processing Units).

Therefore, it can be inferred that the deep learning model was likely trained using either GPUs or TPUs, as these are the most common hardware resources used for deep learning due to their ability to perform parallel processing, which is essential for training large and complex models. However, without explicit information, it is not possible to definitively say which hardware resource was used.
