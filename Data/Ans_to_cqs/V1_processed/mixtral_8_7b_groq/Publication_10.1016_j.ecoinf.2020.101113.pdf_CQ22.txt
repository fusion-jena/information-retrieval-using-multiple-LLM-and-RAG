The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including precision and recall. Accuracy is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

Precision, also known as positive predictive value, is the fraction of positive predictions (i.e., predictions of presence) that are correct. It is calculated as the number of true positives (TP) divided by the sum of true positives and false positives (FP). In equation form, precision is represented as P(τ) = TP(τ) / (TP(τ) + FP(τ)).

Recall, also known as sensitivity or true positive rate, measures the fraction of actual presences that are correctly identified. It is calculated as the number of true positives (TP) divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives (FN). In equation form, recall is represented as R(τ) = TP(τ) / (TP(τ) + FN(τ)).

In addition to precision and recall, the average precision (AP) is also used to evaluate the performance of the model. The AP approximates the integral of the precision-recall curve and is independent of the chosen threshold τ. It is defined as the weighted sum of precisions at each threshold, using the increase in recall from the previous threshold as the weight.

The mean average precision (mAP) across classes is commonly used in multi-label prediction evaluation.

A precision-recall curve consists of the points in precision-recall space achieved at each possible threshold. Recall is typically the horizontal axis and precision the vertical axis.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model and to compare the performance of different models.
