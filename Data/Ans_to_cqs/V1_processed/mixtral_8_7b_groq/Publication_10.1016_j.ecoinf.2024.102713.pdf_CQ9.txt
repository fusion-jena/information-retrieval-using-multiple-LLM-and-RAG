Based on the information provided, there is no explicit mention of the data repository where the deep learning pipeline's data is available, such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. The text does provide details about the data platform's architecture, data sources, and storage, but it does not specify where the data repository for the deep learning pipeline is located. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query. However, the text does provide links to download data and code within the paper, which might be helpful for interested readers.
