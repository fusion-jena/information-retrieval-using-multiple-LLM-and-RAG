The provided context does not give specific information on the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. It discusses the network training and hyper-parameters, model evaluation matrices, and the performance of a model on test data. However, it does not mention the data splitting criteria. Data splitting is a crucial step in machine learning and deep learning model development where the dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets. Typically, the data is split in the ratio of 70:15:15 or 80:10:10 for training, validation, and testing respectively. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used for tuning hyperparameters and the test set is used to evaluate the final model performance. The context provided focuses on other aspects of model development and does not mention the data splitting criteria.
