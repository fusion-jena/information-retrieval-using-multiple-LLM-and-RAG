Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about a deep learning model being used in the study. However, I can describe the generalization measures that were taken for the models mentioned in the context, which include KNN, GP, TREE, RF, XGB, SVR, and MLP.

To ensure the generalizability of the models, the dataset was divided into training sets (80%) and a test set (20%). This division was done randomly to maintain the distribution of key features and target variables across both subsets and minimize the risk of bias. The scikit-learn function GridSearchCV was used for hyperparameter tuning within the training set, employing a five-fold cross-validation process. The negative mean square error was set as the target measure.

After hyperparameter optimization, performance metrics were evaluated using the designated test set. The most effective models for each target variable were then determined based on the performance metrics obtained.

For the deep learning models specifically, common techniques to ensure generalizability include:

1. Diverse dataset: Collecting a diverse and representative dataset with a wide range of input features and target variables.
2. Cross-validation: Using k-fold cross-validation to train and validate the model on different subsets of the data, reducing overfitting and providing a more robust estimate of the model's performance.
3. Stratified splitting: When dealing with imbalanced datasets, using stratified sampling to ensure that each subset contains a similar proportion of samples from each class.
4. Regularization: Applying techniques like L1 and L2 regularization to reduce overfitting and improve generalization.
5. Early stopping: Monitoring the model's performance during training and stopping the training process early if the validation loss starts to increase.
6. Data augmentation: Artificially increasing the size of the dataset by applying transformations or other modifications to the existing data.

However, the context does not explicitly mention these techniques being applied to deep learning models.
