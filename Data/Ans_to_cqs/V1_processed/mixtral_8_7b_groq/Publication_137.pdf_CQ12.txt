The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a combination of PointNet, a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). 

The PointNet network is used for superpoint embedding. PointNet is a deep neural network that directly takes point clouds as inputs and outputs a vector for each point, which represents the properties of the point and its local region. It is designed to handle unordered and permutation-invariant point sets, making it suitable for point cloud data.

The GRU is used in conjunction with the PointNet network for segmenting the point clouds based on context. GRUs are a type of RNN that can capture temporal dependencies and are often used for sequential data. In this case, the GRU is used to model the spatial dependencies between the superpoints in the point cloud.

Therefore, the deep learning model used in this pipeline is a hybrid of PointNet and GRU, leveraging the strengths of both CNNs and RNNs to effectively handle point cloud data and its spatial dependencies.
