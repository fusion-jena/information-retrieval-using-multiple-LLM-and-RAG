The provided context discusses various methods and techniques used for estimating Water Quality Parameters (WQP) in different water bodies, but it does not directly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does imply that satellite data, specifically from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and Landsat satellites, are used for WQP estimation. It can be inferred that these satellite data are likely used as raw data in the deep learning pipeline.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of measured data from 2017 to 2019 in a study by Li et al. (2021), which suggests that in-situ measurements could also be used as raw data in a deep learning pipeline.

Furthermore, the context highlights the application of machine learning (ML) and ensemble learning (EL) techniques in WQP estimation. These techniques typically require labeled data for training, which implies that the raw data used in these ML and EL pipelines would likely come from a combination of satellite data and in-situ measurements.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that satellite data and in-situ measurements are likely used as raw data for WQP estimation in deep learning pipelines.
