The provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. There is no mention of any specific repository or dataset deposit related to the YOLOv5s model or any other models discussed in the text. The context focuses on the model architecture, its backbone network, and comparisons with other models, but it does not provide information about where the data used for training or testing these models can be found. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
