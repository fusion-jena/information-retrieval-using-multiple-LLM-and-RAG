The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Bias Error (MBE). These metrics are used to measure the average deviation between the model prediction and the reference data. MAE measures the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual values, while RMSE gives a higher penalty to large deviations. MBE is used to identify systematic biases in the predictions.

In addition to these metrics, normalized counterparts MAE%, RMSE%, and MBE% are also calculated by dividing by the corresponding mean values over the training data. These normalized metrics are given as a fraction over the respective training set mean.

The model's performance is evaluated for each pixel and variable as a point estimate using its approximate mean, as shown in Eq. (3) of the context. The metrics are calculated for all ALS areas as well as for individual geographic regions.

It is worth noting that the metrics used in this context are primarily focused on measuring the deviation between the model prediction and the reference data. Other metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall, which are commonly used in classification problems, are not mentioned in this context.
