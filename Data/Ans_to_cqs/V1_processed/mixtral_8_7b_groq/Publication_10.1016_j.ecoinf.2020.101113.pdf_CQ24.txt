The provided context discusses the training of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying bioacoustic data but does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, there are some implicit strategies that can be inferred.

One such strategy is the use of a fixed random seed value for reproducibility. Although not explicitly stated, the authors mention that they used a ResNet50 model, which is a type of CNN. ResNet50 has multiple layers, and the weights for these layers are initialized with random values during the training process. If a fixed random seed value is used, the same set of random weights will be generated every time the model is trained, ensuring reproducibility of the results. This is a common practice in deep learning to ensure that the performance of the model can be replicated.

Another strategy that can be inferred from the context is data augmentation. Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the size of the training dataset by applying random transformations to the existing data. These transformations can include rotation, scaling, and flipping for image data or time-shifting and pitch-shifting for audio data. By applying these random transformations, the model is trained on a more diverse set of data, which can help to reduce overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

Finally, the authors mention that they used a single ResNet50 model instead of an ensemble of models. While ensembles can improve the performance of a deep learning model, they also introduce additional randomness into the pipeline. By using a single model, the authors ensured that the randomness in the pipeline was reduced, making it easier to interpret the results.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, some implicit strategies can be inferred. These include the use of a fixed random seed value for reproducibility, data augmentation to increase the diversity of the training data, and the use of a single model instead of an ensemble to reduce randomness.
