Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling being applied in the described study. The focus of the study is on optimizing data structures for machine learning (ML) models used in wildfire mapping and does not mention any image processing techniques typically associated with data augmentation.

However, the study does discuss the strategic selection of predictors from Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery and the integration of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, which could potentially include image transformation methods to increase the diversity of the training data. But, these methods are not specified.

In summary, while data augmentation techniques are commonly used in deep learning pipelines, the given context does not explicitly state their application in this particular study.
