The pieces of context provided do not specifically mention the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. However, they do mention the use of high spatial resolution satellite image data from MODIS products for training machine learning models to estimate leaf area index (LAI) values.

In the context of remote sensing and geospatial analysis, raster data formats such as GeoTIFF or ENVI are commonly used for satellite image data. These formats allow for the storage of georeferencing information along with the image data, enabling accurate spatial analysis.

For the specific case of LAI estimation, the context mentions the use of MODIS products, which provide global LAI data in a gridded format. These data are likely processed and converted into a suitable raster format for use in machine learning algorithms.

In the context of deep learning, various data formats can be used depending on the specific application. For image-based tasks such as object detection or semantic segmentation, raster image formats are commonly used. For time-series data or tabular data, formats such as CSV or HDF5 may be used.

Overall, while the specific data formats used in a deep learning pipeline for remote sensing and LAI estimation are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, it can be inferred that raster image formats are likely used for the satellite image data.
