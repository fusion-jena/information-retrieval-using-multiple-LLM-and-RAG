The provided context does not give specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The text mentions that a random hyperparameter search was conducted to determine the optimum model structure, but it does not specify the optimization techniques used during the training of the deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
