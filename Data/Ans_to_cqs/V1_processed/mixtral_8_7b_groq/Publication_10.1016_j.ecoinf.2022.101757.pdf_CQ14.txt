Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, such as through methods like grid search or random search. The text focuses on presenting the results of the study, which involves using a model for semantic segmentation and analyzing its performance regarding skyline metrics.

The study uses the DeepLabv3+ model with COCO classes and Conditional Random Fields for detailed skyline inference. They also apply binarization of the results, extraction of classes below the sky, and filtering of images without natural objects below the sky. The researchers then select reference points from the photo and associate them with the classified objects. After this, they extract distances, create topographic maps, and calculate metrics per class object.

The authors evaluate the performance of their model using the R-squared (R2) metric for different object classes and distances. They also introduce windowing and perform linear regression considering windowed metrics with a variable window length.

However, the optimization of the model's hyperparameters is not discussed in the context provided. Therefore, it is not possible to give a precise answer to this query without additional information.
