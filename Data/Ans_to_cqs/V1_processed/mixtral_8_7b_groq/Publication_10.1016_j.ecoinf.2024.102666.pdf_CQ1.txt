The deep learning pipeline for processing and analyzing aquatic environments often involves the use of satellite sensors for collecting raw data. In particular, sensors such as MSI (MultiSpectral Instrument) and OLCI (Ocean and Land Colour Instrument) are used. These sensors capture spectral bands in various wavelengths, including blue, green, red, and near-infrared (NIR). The specific central wavelengths and resolution for each spectral band used by MSI and OLCI are listed in Table 1.

For instance, MSI has spectral bands for blue (490 nm), green (560 nm), red (665 nm), and NIR (783 nm) with a resolution of 10 m, 10 m, 10 m, and 20 m, respectively. Similarly, OLCI has spectral bands for blue (490 nm), green (560 nm), red (665 nm), and NIR (779 nm) with a resolution of 300 m for all spectral bands.

Additionally, in-situ measured data, such as water quality measurements, can also be used as raw data in the deep learning pipeline. These measurements can be taken using various methods, such as surveys or sensors, and can be used to validate and improve the accuracy of the satellite data.

It is worth noting that the deep learning pipeline for processing and analyzing aquatic environments often involves atmospheric correction (AC) of the satellite data. This process is necessary to remove the effects of the atmosphere on the satellite data, such as scattering and absorption, to obtain accurate estimates of water quality parameters. Various AC algorithms, such as the Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes (FLAASH) model, are used for this purpose.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline for processing and analyzing aquatic environments typically involves the use of satellite sensors, such as MSI and OLCI, to collect raw data in the form of spectral bands. In-situ measured data can also be used as raw data. Additionally, AC algorithms are used to correct the satellite data for atmospheric effects.
