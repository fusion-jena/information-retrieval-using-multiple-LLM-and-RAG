Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix after the model training. However, it does mention that during inference, the patch size is set to 1024 × 1,024 pixels to accelerate the process. 

Additionally, the model goes through a fine-tuning process for 4 iterations using the entire SW stratum with the SAL. The SAL is a Semi-Automatic Loop that integrates both the DL model and a human-expert interpreter. The SAL operates by taking aerial images as input, passing them through the DL model to harvest point detections, and then conducting a 256 × 256 pixel crop, centered on each detection, generating thumbnails. These thumbnails undergo a rapid examination during the initial human verification step, where they are manually classified as False Positive (FP), True Positive (TP), or uncertain object.

Therefore, based on the context, the postprocessing steps primarily involve human verification and classification of the model's outputs (thumbnails) rather than computational methods like saliency maps or confusion matrix calculation.
