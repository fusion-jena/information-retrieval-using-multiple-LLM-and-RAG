Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, the context does discuss the use of a nine-cell approach for smoothing data inaccuracies within single grid cells for the FWI and FFMC data layers with a spatial resolution of 1 Ã— 1 km.

This technique could be seen as a form of regularization, as it aims to reduce overfitting by smoothing out noise or fluctuations in the data within each grid cell. By averaging the data from the nine surrounding cells, the approach can help to reduce the impact of any outliers or errors in the original data, leading to more stable and accurate predictions.

However, this technique is not directly related to the regularization methods commonly used in deep learning, such as dropout or L2 regularization. Dropout involves randomly setting a fraction of the activations in a layer to zero during training, which helps to prevent overfitting by reducing the co-adaptation of neurons. L2 regularization, on the other hand, adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the norm of the model's weights, which encourages the model to use smaller weights and avoid overfitting.

Therefore, while the nine-cell approach used in the study could be seen as a form of regularization, it is not the same as the regularization methods commonly used in deep learning. Without further information, it is not possible to answer this query definitively.
