The provided context does not mention the use of any deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch for building the model. Instead, it describes the PLUS model, which consists of two main modules: the transformed specification mining framework based on the land expansion analysis strategy (LEAS) and the cellular automata (CA) model based on a multi-type random patch seed mechanism (CARS). The LEAS module employs the random forest algorithm to obtain the development probabilities of each land use type based on two periods of land use data. The PLUS model also proposes a decreasing threshold rule for generating patch seeds, which is achieved through an iterative process.

The context also mentions that the model uses Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data with a spatial resolution of 500m and meteorological data provided by CMIP6. Figures 7 and 8 in the context show the spatial distribution of NDVI from 2001 to 2020 and the spatial distribution of predicted NDVI in 2030, respectively.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be concluded that the PLUS model uses the random forest algorithm and does not use any deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
