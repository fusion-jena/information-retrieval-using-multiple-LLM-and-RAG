The provided context does not discuss the deep learning pipeline specifically. However, it does mention the use of machine learning models in the context of ecological informatics and species distribution modeling. The data formats used in this study are not explicitly stated, but based on the nature of the study, it can be inferred that the data used is likely in a format that can represent environmental variables and species distribution, such as CSV or raster format for spatial data.

In the field of deep learning, data formats used in the pipeline can vary widely depending on the task at hand. Some common data formats include:

* Images: Deep learning has been widely used in computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation. In these cases, the data is typically in the form of images, often in JPEG or PNG format.
* Audio: Deep learning has also been used for audio-related tasks such as speech recognition, music generation, and sound event detection. In these cases, the data is typically in the form of audio files, such as WAV or MP3.
* Video: Deep learning can be used for video-related tasks such as action recognition, object tracking, and video summarization. In these cases, the data is typically in the form of video files, such as MP4 or AVI.
* Text: Deep learning has been used for natural language processing tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and machine translation. In these cases, the data is typically in the form of text files, such as CSV or plain text.
* Time-series data: Deep learning can be used for time-series data analysis such as stock price prediction, weather forecasting, and anomaly detection. In these cases, the data is typically in the form of CSV or other tabular data formats.

In summary, the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline can vary widely depending on the specific task. However, common data formats include images, audio, video, text, and time-series data. The provided context does not give enough information to determine the data formats used in the study.
