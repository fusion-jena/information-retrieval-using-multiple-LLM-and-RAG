The provided context does not include specific information about the software frameworks used to build deep learning models. However, it does mention that deep learning algorithms, which are a type of machine learning model, have been developed and applied in various fields since 2006. These algorithms are an extension of classical neural network models and are capable of training large-scale data to extract deeply hidden characteristic information and features.

Some examples of deep learning models include convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which have been used for tasks such as image and speech recognition. There are several software frameworks that can be used to build and train deep learning models, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. These frameworks provide tools and functions for designing, training, and evaluating deep learning models.

TensorFlow is an open-source software library developed by Google Brain Team. It is a powerful tool for building and training machine learning models, and it supports a wide range of neural network architectures, including CNNs and RNNs. TensorFlow allows users to define computational graphs and perform automatic differentiation, which are useful for training deep learning models.

PyTorch is another open-source deep learning framework that is widely used in academia and industry. It is known for its simplicity and flexibility, and it allows users to define and train deep learning models using Python code. PyTorch also supports automatic differentiation and provides tools for visualizing and debugging models.

Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention specific software frameworks for building deep learning models, there are several popular frameworks available, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. These frameworks provide tools and functions for designing, training, and evaluating deep learning models.
