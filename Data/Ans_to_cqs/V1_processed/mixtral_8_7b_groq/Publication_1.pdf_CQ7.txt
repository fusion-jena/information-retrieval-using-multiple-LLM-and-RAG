In the context provided, there is no explicit information given about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it is common practice in machine learning to split the data into three sets: training, validation, and testing.

The training set is used to train the model, i.e., to adjust the model's parameters to minimize the difference between the model's predictions and the actual values.

The validation set is used during the training process to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model learns the training data too well, to the point where it performs poorly on unseen data. The validation set helps to ensure that the model generalizes well to new data.

The testing set is used after the training process to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. This gives an indication of how well the model will perform in real-world scenarios.

The criteria used to split the data into these sets can vary. A common approach is to use 60-20-20 or 70-15-15 splits for training, validation, and testing, respectively. However, the optimal split can depend on the size and quality of the data, as well as the specific problem being addressed.

In the context of biodiversity monitoring, the data is likely to be split based on factors such as the availability of labeled data, the distribution of species, and the balance between rare and common species. It is important to ensure that the training, validation, and testing sets are representative of the overall data distribution, to ensure that the model can accurately detect rare species.

In summary, while the context provided does not give specific criteria for splitting the data for deep learning model training, it is common practice to use a training set, a validation set, and a testing set. The criteria used to split the data can vary, but it is important to ensure that the splits are representative of the overall data distribution.
