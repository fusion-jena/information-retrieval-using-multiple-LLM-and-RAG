Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context mainly focuses on the use of deep learning algorithms, specifically the YOLOv8 algorithm and its modifications, for crop pest detection and counting. It describes how the researchers developed an improved YOLOv8 model with architecture modifications to detect and count NBSB (a soybean pest) and tested it with image datasets. However, it does not mention where the code repository for this deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
