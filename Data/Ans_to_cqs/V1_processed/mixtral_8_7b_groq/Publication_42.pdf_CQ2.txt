Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline in this particular study uses image data format as input to the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. There is no explicit mention of other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV. However, it can be inferred that the data used in this study consists of images of moths, which were manually annotated and used for training and validating the CNN model.

The study also mentions the use of pre-trained weights from ResNetV50, which is a CNN architecture developed for large-scale image recognition. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning pipeline in this study uses image data format as input to the CNN model.
