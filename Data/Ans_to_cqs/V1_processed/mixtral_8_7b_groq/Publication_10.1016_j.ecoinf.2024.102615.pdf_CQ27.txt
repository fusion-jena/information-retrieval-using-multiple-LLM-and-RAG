Based on the provided context, there is no information given about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. The context mainly focuses on the optimization process of the MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) model, including the tuning ranges of hyperparameters and the optimal MLP architecture and parameters.

The optimization process is divided into two stages. The first stage focuses on adjusting the neural network structure and the number of neurons in the hidden layers. The second stage involves adjusting the percentage of dropout layers, the learning rate, and the batch size. The validation set's R value is used as the performance indicator during the optimization process.

The input layer of the optimal MLP architecture has 4200 dimensions, corresponding to the spectral reflectance data's dimensions. The first hidden layer contains 2048 neurons, followed by a batch normalization layer and a dropout layer. The second hidden layer also has 2048 neurons, followed by a batch normalization layer and a dropout layer. The output layer contains 1024 neurons.

Therefore, while the context provides detailed information about the optimization process and the optimal MLP architecture, it does not mention any steps taken for deploying the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection.

 The provided context does not contain information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection.
