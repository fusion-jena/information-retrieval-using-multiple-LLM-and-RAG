The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a deep learning model, so I will base my answer on the general context of the text and the implied use of deep learning in the future.


The purpose of the deep learning model, as implied by the context, is likely to be used for image classification or segmentation in the analysis of land use and land cover (LULC) in the Kruger National Park (KNP) and other similar areas. The deep learning model, specifically a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), will be used to map land cover or more specifically woody cover. This is based on the statement that deep learning methods will be most effective and useful for analyzing aerial images of KNP taken every two years. Additionally, the analysis of large-area historical datasets in land-use and land-cover analysis can serve as a resource to better understand long-term landscape changes and support ecological monitoring programs.

It is also worth noting that the current study uses a Random Forest classifier, which is a machine learning algorithm, but not a deep learning one. The Random Forest classifier is used to assess the variable importance of 18 GLCM texture metrics and to classify all other segmented objects into woody or non-woody LC. However, the text suggests that deep learning methods, such as CNN, will be more effective in the future for this type of analysis.
