Based on the provided context, the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipelines are not explicitly mentioned. However, there are references to various applications of deep learning techniques in object recognition, speech and audio recognition, and biosecurity.

In object recognition, a large deep convolutional neural network was trained on the ImageNet LSVRC-2010 dataset, which contains 1.2 million high-resolution images distributed across 1000 different classes (Krizhevsky, Sutskever, & Hinton, 2012). Another study applied Cellular Simultaneous Recurrent Networks (CSRNs) and Regularized Extreme Learning Machines (RELM) for object recognition, using three popular data sets for evaluation, but the specific names of these datasets are not provided (Alom, Alam, Taha, & Iftekharuddin, 2017). Additionally, an object recognition algorithm for the automatic identification and removal of invasive fish was developed using unspecified datasets (Zhang, D., Lee, D.-J., Zhang, M., Tippetts, B. J., & Lillywhite, K. D., 2016).

In the context of audio and speech recognition, a robust sound event classification approach was proposed using bilinear multi-column ELM-AE and two-stage ensemble learning (Zhang, J., Yin, J., Zhang, Q., Shi, J., & Li, Y., 2017). Another study focused on automated bird acoustic event detection and robust species classification, but the specific datasets used in their deep learning pipeline are not mentioned (Zhao, Z., Zhang, S.-H., Xu, Z.-Y., Bellisario, K., Dai, N.-H., Omrani, H., & Pijanowski, B. C., 2017).

Lastly, the paper "Extreme deep learning in biosecurity: the case of machine hearing for marine species identification" (Demertzis, Iliadis, & Anezakis, 2018) discusses the application of deep learning techniques in biosecurity without specifying the datasets used in their analyses.

In summary, while the context provides insights into various applications of deep learning techniques in different fields, it does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipelines. Therefore, the answer to the query is:


The specific datasets used in the deep learning pipelines are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, there are references to deep learning applications in object recognition using the ImageNet LSVRC-2010 dataset, as well as other unspecified datasets in audio and speech recognition, object recognition, and biosecurity.
