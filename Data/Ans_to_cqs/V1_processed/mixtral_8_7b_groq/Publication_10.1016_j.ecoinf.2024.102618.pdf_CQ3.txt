Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for plant disease classification. The context mainly focuses on the comparison and proposal of different deep learning models for plant disease classification, as well as data augmentation methods to increase the number of images in the dataset.

However, it is mentioned that the LifeCLEF 2015 dataset contains labeled images of different plant organs, such as flowers and fruits. In general, data annotation techniques for images can include bounding box annotation, where a box is drawn around the object of interest, and instance segmentation, where each pixel of the object is labeled. These techniques can be used for annotating images of plant organs in the dataset.

In summary, while the provided context does not specifically mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for plant disease classification, it is mentioned that the dataset contains labeled images of plant organs. Common data annotation techniques for images include bounding box annotation and instance segmentation.
