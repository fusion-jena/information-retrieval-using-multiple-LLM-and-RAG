While the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does describe several strategies that help manage variability and bias in model training.



The context describes the use of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with an initial learning rate of 0.01 for all models, except MansNet, which starts at 0.1. The learning rate is reduced by a factor of 10 after 30 epochs. This approach manages learning rate randomness by systematically adjusting the rate at which the model learns from the data, preventing overfitting or underfitting.

Additionally, batch normalization is used in the models, which introduces randomness by normalizing the inputs of each batch. This strategy helps reduce internal covariate shift, improving the model's generalization and training speed.

The models are trained on a dataset divided into training (80%) and test (20%) groups, with images within each class (species) split along the 80:20 ratio to maintain their proportional representations. This data split strategy ensures that the models are exposed to different subsets of data during training and testing, reducing overfitting and improving generalization.

An image augmentation strategy is employed, including random rotation (≤ 100°), crop (≤ 10%), sheer (≤ 30%), and horizontal flip. These techniques increase the diversity of the training data, reducing overfitting and improving the model's ability to handle real-world variations.

Lastly, the context explains that pre-trained models on the ImageNet database are used and then retrained for bumble bee species classification. Using pre-trained models helps leverage prior learning, reducing the risk of overfitting and improving the model's ability to learn from limited data.

While not explicitly mentioned, the use of a random seed value could be employed to ensure reproducibility in the deep learning pipeline. This practice would help manage randomness in initializing weights, shuffling data, and other random processes in the pipeline.
