In the deep learning pipeline, data annotation is a crucial step that involves labeling data to assign metadata. There are various data annotation techniques, including bounding box annotation and instance segmentation.

Bounding box annotation is a technique where the boundaries of objects are outlined in an image to associate every single pixel of objects in an entire image with a particular tag/label. This technique is commonly used in object detection tasks where the goal is to identify and locate objects within an image. The annotated data can be converted into a COCO 1.0 dataset, which is formatted in JSON and contains object id, image id, category id, segmentation, area, bbox, attributes, and other relevant information.

Instance segmentation, on the other hand, is a more advanced technique that involves segmenting individual objects within an image and assigning them a unique label. This technique is used when the goal is to not only identify and locate objects within an image but also to differentiate between individual instances of the same object. For instance, in an image containing multiple people, instance segmentation can be used to differentiate between each person and label them individually.

There are various tools available for data annotation, including Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT) developed by Intel, which was used in the research mentioned in the context. CVAT provides a user-friendly interface for annotating images and converting them into a COCO 1.0 dataset.

Some of the deep learning models that use these data annotation techniques include BoxInst, Res2Net, YOLACT, YOLACT++, Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN), FastFCN, Mask R-CNN, and U-Net. BoxInst uses bounding box annotations to achieve high-performance instance segmentation. Res2Net is a multi-scale backbone architecture that can be used for various computer vision tasks, including object detection and semantic segmentation. YOLACT and YOLACT++ are real-time instance segmentation models that use bounding box annotations. FCN and FastFCN are fully convolutional networks that use dilated convolution for semantic segmentation. Mask R-CNN is a popular deep learning model that uses bounding box annotations for object detection and instance segmentation. U-Net is a convolutional neural network that was initially developed for biomedical image segmentation but has since been used for various other segmentation tasks.

In summary, data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline include bounding box annotation and instance segmentation. These techniques are used to label data and differentiate between objects and instances within an image. Various tools and deep learning models are available for data annotation, including CVAT, BoxInst, Res2Net, YOLACT, YOLACT++, FCN, FastFCN, Mask R-CNN, and U-Net.
