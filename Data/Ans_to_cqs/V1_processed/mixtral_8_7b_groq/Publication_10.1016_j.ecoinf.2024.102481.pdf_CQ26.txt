The provided context discusses the use of machine learning techniques, including deep learning, in the field of fisheries and ecology, but it does not explicitly mention the data bias reduction techniques used during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does allude to some techniques that could be used to address data bias.

Stratified splitting is a sampling technique that could be used to ensure that the training and testing datasets are representative of the entire dataset. This technique involves dividing the dataset into strata based on certain characteristics, such as class distribution, and then randomly sampling from each stratum to create the training and testing sets. This can help to ensure that the model is trained on a diverse set of data and is not biased towards any particular class.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques that can be used to address class imbalance in the dataset. Class imbalance occurs when one class has significantly more examples than another class. This can lead to a biased model that performs well on the majority class but poorly on the minority class. Oversampling involves creating more examples of the minority class, while undersampling involves reducing the number of examples of the majority class. Both techniques can help to balance the class distribution and improve the model's performance on the minority class.

Diverse data collection is another technique that can be used to address data bias. This involves collecting data from a variety of sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population. This can help to ensure that the model is trained on a diverse set of data and is not biased towards any particular subset of the population.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data bias reduction techniques used during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, it does allude to some techniques that could be used to address data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.
