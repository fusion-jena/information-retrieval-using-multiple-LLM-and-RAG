The provided context discusses the evaluation of a predictive model for estimating volumetric water content (VWC) in soil, but it does not specifically mention the use of a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot directly answer the query regarding the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model in this particular context.

However, I can provide a general answer regarding the evaluation metrics commonly used for deep learning models.

When evaluating deep learning models, several metrics can be used to assess their performance, including accuracy, precision, recall, and others. Here's a brief description of each:

1. Accuracy: This is the proportion of correct predictions out of the total number of predictions made. It is a common metric for evaluating the performance of a model, but it may not be the best choice when dealing with imbalanced datasets.
2. Precision: This measures the proportion of true positive predictions (relevant items) out of all positive predictions made. It is useful when the cost of a false positive is high.
3. Recall (Sensitivity): This measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances. It is useful when the cost of a false negative is high.
4. F1-score: This is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics.
5. Mean Absolute Error (MAE): This measures the average magnitude of errors between predicted and actual values. It is less sensitive to outliers than Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
6. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): This measures the square root of the average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values. It gives more weight to larger errors compared to MAE.
7. R-squared (Coefficient of Determination): This measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. It ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating a perfect fit.

In the context of the provided information, the model's performance was evaluated using MAE, RMSE, and R-squared. However, these metrics might not be the only ones used for deep learning models, and the choice of metrics depends on the specific problem and the desired trade-off between various performance aspects.
