The provided context does not give specific information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, such as whether a method like grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization was used. However, it does provide the primary hyperparameter settings for three detection models (YOLOX and YOLOv8) used in a study on cross-season weed detection. These settings include the initial learning rate, learning rate schedule, NMS threshold, confidence threshold, weight decay, image size, batch size, and optimization algorithm. It is possible that these hyperparameters were determined through a process of experimentation and fine-tuning, but the specific optimization method used is not specified in the given text.
