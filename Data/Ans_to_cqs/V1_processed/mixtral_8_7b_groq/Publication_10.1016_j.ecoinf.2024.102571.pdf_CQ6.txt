Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved, including normalization, scaling, and cleaning. These steps are crucial to ensure the quality of the data and improve the performance of the model.

Normalization is the process of rescaling numeric columns in the dataset to a common range, often between 0 and 1. This is important because deep learning models are sensitive to the scale of the input features. If some features have much larger values than others, the model may give too much importance to those features, leading to poor performance. Normalization can be achieved using various techniques, such as min-max scaling or z-score scaling.

Scaling is similar to normalization, but it rescales the features to a common standard deviation, typically 1. Scaling is useful when the features have different units or orders of magnitude. Like normalization, scaling helps to ensure that all features are given equal importance in the model.

Cleaning is the process of identifying and handling missing or invalid data in the dataset. Missing data can occur due to various reasons, such as human error or data corruption. Deep learning models are sensitive to missing data and can produce incorrect results if not handled properly. There are several ways to handle missing data, such as imputation, where missing values are replaced with statistical estimates, or deletion, where rows with missing data are removed from the dataset.

In addition to these preprocessing steps, feature engineering may also be required to extract relevant features from the data. Feature engineering involves transforming the raw data into a format that is more suitable for the model. This can include techniques such as dimensionality reduction, where the number of features is reduced to improve computational efficiency, or feature extraction, where new features are created from the existing ones.

For example, in the study by Uzlu (2021), a three-layer feedforward back-propagation neural network with a 30-20-10 architecture was developed to estimate greenhouse gas emissions in Turkey. The input factors were population size and GDP, and the predicted output was GHGdwts. Before training the model, the data were normalized using min-max scaling, and missing data were handled using imputation.

Therefore, preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning are essential for training deep learning models. These steps help to ensure the quality of the data and improve the performance of the model. Additionally, feature engineering may also be required to extract relevant features from the data.
