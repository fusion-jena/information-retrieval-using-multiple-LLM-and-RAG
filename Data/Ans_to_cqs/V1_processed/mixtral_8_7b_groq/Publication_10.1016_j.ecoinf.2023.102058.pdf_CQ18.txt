In the study "An ensemble machine-learning-based framework for estimating total nitrogen concentration in water using drone-borne hyperspectral imagery of emergent plants: A case study in an arid oasis, NW China," the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is through the use of a grid search and a specific number of trees (ntrees).

The researchers used a grid search to find the best number of trees (ntrees) for their random forest (RF) model. Grid search is a hyperparameter tuning technique that involves systematically searching through a range of predefined hyperparameter values to find the combination that results in the best model performance. In this case, the hyperparameter that was tuned was ntrees, and the best value found was 500 trees.

Using a specific number of trees (ntrees) helps to monitor the model performance during training by reducing the noise sensitivity of individual tree predictions. The random forest algorithm trains multiple decision trees and then combines their results using a voting procedure. By using a large number of trees, the random forest model can reduce the noise sensitivity of individual tree predictions and produce more accurate results.

Furthermore, the training data for the random forest model was created using the bagging approach, which involves drawing sample subsets with replacement. This approach helps to create a more robust model by reducing overfitting and increasing the generalization of the model.

Overall, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training in this study involved using a grid search to find the best number of trees (ntrees) for the random forest model, reducing the noise sensitivity of individual tree predictions, and using the bagging approach to create a robust training dataset.
