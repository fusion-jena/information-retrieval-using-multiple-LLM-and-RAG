Unfortunately, the provided pieces of context do not include information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The context describes the methods and materials used in a study that involved training deep learning models for shark detection, but it does not mention the location of the code repository. It is possible that the code was not made publicly available, or it may be hosted on a platform other than GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
