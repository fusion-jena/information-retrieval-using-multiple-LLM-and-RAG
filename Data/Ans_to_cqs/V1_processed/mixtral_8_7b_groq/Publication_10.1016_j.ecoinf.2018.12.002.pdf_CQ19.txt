Based on the provided context, there is no specific mention of any deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch being used in the study titled "Machine learning for inferring animal behavior from location and movement data" by Guiming Wang. The study focuses on the application of machine learning techniques, including supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, hidden Markov models, and state space models, to classify animal behavior using location and movement data. However, it does not mention the use of deep learning models or specific deep learning frameworks. Therefore, I cannot provide the names of the frameworks used to build the deep learning model for this study.
