The data format used in the deep learning pipeline described in the given context is images. The study focuses on RGB-based tree identification using airborne imagery. The images are normalized by subtracting the ImageNet mean from each channel to align the unsupervised classifications with the ImageNet pretraining weights. Data augmentation techniques such as random flips and translations were tested but found to have little effect on the final score. Therefore, the deep learning pipeline in this context specifically works with image data.
