Based on the provided context, the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for the studies mentioned are not explicitly stated. However, we can infer that the datasets used are related to water quality parameters, algal-related parameters, and chlorophyll-a concentrations.

In the study by Busari, Sahoo, and Jana (2024), they developed a deep learning model with Bayesian approximation for uncertainty assessment to predict chlorophyll-a as an indicator of harmful algal blooms (HABs). The dataset used in this study is not explicitly mentioned, but it is related to water quality parameters and chlorophyll-a concentrations in a water body.

Cen et al. (2022) applied deep learning in the prediction of chlorophyll-a concentration in the East China Sea. The dataset used in this study consists of remote sensing data, including ocean color images and meteorological data.

The studies mentioned in the context use various machine learning models, such as random forest (RF), Multilayer perceptron (MLP), long-short term memory (LSTM), and support vector regression (SVR), to predict different algal-related parameters. However, the datasets used in these studies are not explicitly stated.

Therefore, the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for the studies mentioned are not explicitly provided in the context. The datasets used are related to water quality parameters, algal-related parameters, and chlorophyll-a concentrations.
