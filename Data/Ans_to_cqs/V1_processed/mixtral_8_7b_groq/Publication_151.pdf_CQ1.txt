The provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the description of a method for phylogenetic placement using a trained CNN model, rather than the data collection process.

In general, deep learning pipelines can use various data collection methods, depending on the specific application. For instance, in natural language processing, data can be collected from online text sources, books, or surveys. In computer vision, data can be gathered using sensors, cameras, or public datasets like ImageNet. In the context of phylogenetics, raw data typically consists of biological sequence data, which can be obtained from genome sequencing projects, gene banks, or scientific literature.

In this particular study, the authors use simulated and real phylogenetic data for training and testing their CNN model. The simulated data is generated using a known species tree and specific evolutionary models (ILS or HGT). The real data comes from the Welcome Trust Sanger Institute's (WTSI) World of Laboratory-based Phylogenomics (WoL) dataset. However, the context does not mention how the raw data for these datasets was originally collected.

In summary, the provided context does not contain information on the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for phylogenetic placement.
