Based on the provided context, there is no information about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model. The context consists of various research papers related to environmental science, focusing on water resource management, soil erosion, and salinity-related issues in different regions. While these papers discuss the use of data and models, they do not provide information on the specifics of deploying a trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection.

Model serialization is the process of saving a trained model's architecture, weights, and biases to a file, allowing the model to be easily loaded and used for inference in the future. Platform selection refers to choosing the appropriate hardware or software environment for deploying the model, such as a local machine, a cloud service, or an edge device.

Since the context does not provide information on these topics, it is not possible to answer this query accurately.
