Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, data augmentation is a common technique used in deep learning to increase the diversity of the training data and improve model performance.

Some common data augmentation techniques for image data include flipping, rotating, and scaling. Flipping involves creating new images by flipping the original images horizontally or vertically. Rotating involves creating new images by rotating the original images by a certain angle. Scaling involves creating new images by changing the size of the original images.

In the context provided, it is mentioned that the dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets with a ratio of 80:10:10. The training dataset consisted of 1543 images at an input resolution of 640 × 640 pixels, and 1637 images at an input resolution of 1280 × 1280 pixels. It is also mentioned that five different versions of the YOLOv5 model family were trained to detect alates on sorghum leaves.

Therefore, it is possible that data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling were applied to the training dataset to increase its diversity and improve model performance. However, without explicit mention in the provided context, this is only an assumption.
