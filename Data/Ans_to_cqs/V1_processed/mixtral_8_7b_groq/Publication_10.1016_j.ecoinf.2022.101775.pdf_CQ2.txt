The provided context does not give specific information about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of deep learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Embedding Layers in the context of processing data from Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), IoT-enabled low power environment monitoring systems, and natural language processing problems.

In the case of CNNs, they are commonly used for processing image, audio, and video data. These data formats are typically represented as multi-dimensional arrays, where each dimension corresponds to a different feature of the data. For example, an image might be represented as a 3-dimensional array, with dimensions for height, width, and color channels.

On the other hand, Embedding Layers are typically used for processing categorical data, such as text or user behavior data. In these cases, the data is often represented as a sparse matrix, where each row or column corresponds to a category and the values indicate the presence or absence of that category in a given observation. Embedding Layers replace these sparse representations with dense vectors, allowing the model to learn more complex relationships between categories.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the deep learning pipeline can handle various data formats such as image, audio, video, and CSV, among others, depending on the specific deep learning technique being used and the nature of the data being processed.
