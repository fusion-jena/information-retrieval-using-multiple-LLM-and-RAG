The pieces of context provided do not explicitly mention which frameworks were used to build the deep learning models for plant leaf recognition. The sources mainly focus on the methodologies, approaches, and outcomes of the investigations.

However, it is worth noting that TensorFlow and PyTorch are the two most popular open-source frameworks for building deep learning models. TensorFlow is developed by Google Brain, while PyTorch is developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. These frameworks provide the necessary tools and libraries for designing, training, and deploying deep learning models.

Considering the studies mentioned in the context, such as Pushpa, Rani (2023), Bi et al. (2022), Quach et al. (2023), and others, it can be inferred that they likely used either TensorFlow or PyTorch (or possibly both) to build their deep learning models, as these are the most widely used frameworks in the field of deep learning. Nonetheless, without explicit information from the sources, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
