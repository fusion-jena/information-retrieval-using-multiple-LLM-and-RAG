Based on the provided context, the text describes the use of Maxent models for species distribution modeling, which is a machine learning method but not a deep learning method. Therefore, the text does not explicitly mention any hyperparameters commonly used in deep learning models, such as learning rate or optimizer.

However, Maxent models do have their own set of hyperparameters that can be tuned for better performance. These hyperparameters include regularization parameters, feature classes, and feature combinations. Regularization parameters control the complexity of the model to prevent overfitting, while feature classes and combinations determine the types of environmental variables used in the model.

In the context provided, the authors used the Akaike Information Criterion corrected for small sample sizes (AICc) to determine the best model settings for H. guttulatus and H. hippocampus. They considered models with Î”AICc values less than 2 to have substantial support. The model performance was evaluated using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) and True Skill Statistics (TSS) methods.

Therefore, while the text does not provide information on deep learning model hyperparameters, it does describe the hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation methods used for Maxent models in the species distribution modeling context.
