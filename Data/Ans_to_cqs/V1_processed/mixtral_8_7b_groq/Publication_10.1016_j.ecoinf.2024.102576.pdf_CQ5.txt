The context provided does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the dataset used is satellite imagery, as the study aims to address the limitations of satellite imagery acquisition time, resolution, and validation challenges in land-cover classification.

The authors use deep learning models for land-cover classification, and specifically mention the U-Net model, a type of convolutional neural network (CNN), for image classification. The U-Net model was trained using both training and validation data from satellite imagery.

Moreover, the authors emphasize the importance of the availability of labeling data for U-Net model applications. In the absence of specific classes in North Korea, the authors suggest using phenological characteristics to classify elements based on relevant classes.

Therefore, it can be concluded that the dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is satellite imagery, and the authors employ various strategies to improve the classification accuracy and performance of the deep learning model using this dataset.
