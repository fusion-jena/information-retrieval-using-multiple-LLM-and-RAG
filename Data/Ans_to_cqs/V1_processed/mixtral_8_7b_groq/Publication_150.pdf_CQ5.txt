The context provided does not explicitly mention the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention a few models and papers that are likely to use some common datasets in the field of computer vision and image recognition.

For instance, the InceptionV3 model is mentioned, which is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that was developed by Google researchers and has been trained on the ImageNet dataset. The ImageNet dataset is a large-scale image recognition dataset that contains over 14 million images and 1000 categories. It is widely used as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of image recognition models.

Another paper mentioned is "ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database" by Deng et al., which is the paper that introduced the ImageNet dataset.

Furthermore, the MnasNet-A1 model is mentioned, which is a neural architecture search (NAS) model that was designed for mobile devices. The NAS models typically use a proxy dataset to search for the optimal architecture and then transfer the learned architecture to a target dataset. Therefore, it is likely that MnasNet-A1 was also trained on a common computer vision dataset such as CIFAR or ImageNet.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, it is likely that the models and papers mentioned in the context used common computer vision datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
