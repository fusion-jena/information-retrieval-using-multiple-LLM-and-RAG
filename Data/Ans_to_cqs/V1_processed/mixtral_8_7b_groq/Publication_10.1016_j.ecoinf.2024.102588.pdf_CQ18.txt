The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of early stopping and automatic adjustment of learning rate.

In the context of analyzing aquatic ecosystem health using machine learning models, the study mentioned the use of early stopping to monitor the model performance during training. Specifically, the early stopping option stopped the model training at a specific epoch where the model validation accuracy could not be improved. This strategy helps to prevent overfitting, which can occur when a model is trained for too many iterations, causing it to perform poorly on new, unseen data.

Additionally, in the context of using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for performance evaluation in radiology, the learning rate was initially set to 0.001. However, this value was automatically adjusted to determine the optimum point, resulting in the best performance of the CNN model. This strategy of automatically adjusting the learning rate helps to ensure that the model is learning effectively and not getting stuck in a local minimum.

Overall, these strategies of early stopping and automatic adjustment of learning rate are useful for monitoring the model performance during training and preventing overfitting, which can lead to poor generalization of the model to new data.
