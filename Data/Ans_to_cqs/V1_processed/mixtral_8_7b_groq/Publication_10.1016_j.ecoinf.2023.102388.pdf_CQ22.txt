The provided context discusses the use of discrimination accuracy as a metric for evaluating the performance of deep learning models in the context of membership inference attacks (MIAs) on the GREMM dataset. However, it does not mention other common metrics such as precision, recall, or F1 score.

In the no-overfitting setting, the Siamese Neural Network (SNN) and Ensemble MIA approaches are evaluated based on their discrimination accuracy, which is 65.86% and 86.22%, respectively. Similarly, in the overfitting setting, only discrimination accuracy is reported for both approaches.

Discrimination accuracy is a measure of how well a model can distinguish between members and non-members of the training dataset. In other words, it measures the model's ability to identify which data points were used in the training set and which ones were not.

However, discrimination accuracy alone may not provide a complete picture of a model's performance. Other metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1 score, can provide additional insights into the model's behavior.

Precision measures the proportion of true positives among all positive predictions made by the model. It is calculated as the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false positives.

Recall, on the other hand, measures the proportion of true positives among all actual positives in the dataset. It is calculated as the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives.

The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall and provides a balanced assessment of both metrics. It is calculated as 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall).

In the context of MIAs, precision and recall can be used to evaluate the model's ability to correctly identify members and non-members of the training set. For example, a high precision would indicate that the model is good at identifying members of the training set, while a high recall would indicate that the model is good at identifying non-members.

Therefore, while the provided context focuses on discrimination accuracy, it is important to consider other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score when evaluating the performance of deep learning models.
