The data formats used in the deep learning pipeline for bird detection in this study are images. More specifically, the dataset consists of 9717 images of 15 wild bird species acquired by camera traps in Chinaâ€™s Northeast Tiger and Leopard National Park. The images are represented in a digital format, suitable for deep learning algorithms to process and learn from. No other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV are explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

However, it's worth noting that camera traps can provide data in various formats, including video clips, as mentioned in the context. But for this particular study, the focus is on still images for bird detection. Additionally, other studies might use different data formats depending on their specific research objectives and the type of data available. For instance, some studies might use audio data for bird species identification or CSV files for storing metadata associated with the images or videos.
