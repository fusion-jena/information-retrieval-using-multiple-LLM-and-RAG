The provided context does not contain information about any deep learning model or its hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer. Instead, it includes several studies related to urbanism, habitat factors for wild rabbit conservation, and land cover classifications. These studies use various methods, such as limited memory algorithms for bound constrained optimization and habitat suitability models, but they do not involve deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot provide the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model based on the given context.
