The deep learning pipeline in the study referenced uses raster image data, specifically Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) images. The NDVI dataset, MOD13A2, obtained from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, is provided in its original format with a spatial resolution of 1 km and a temporal resolution of 16 days. These images are then preprocessed, including proportional scaling, projection transformations, and mask extraction based on watershed boundaries.

Additionally, the study uses several other raster datasets related to climate, terrain, and human activity as drivers. These datasets include:

1. Resampled Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data, from which slope and aspect are derived.
2. Landform type data, obtained from the Resource and Environmental Sciences Data Centre of the Chinese Academy (RESDC), reclassified into six categories based on different landform types.
3. Mean annual meteorological data for China, including air temperature, precipitation, sunshine hours, evapotranspiration, and relative humidity, collected from the RESDC. These datasets are interpolated into a 1 km * 1 km grid using ANUSPLIN software.

The study also uses vector datasets, such as watershed boundaries extracted from the ArcGIS Pro 3.0.2 hydrological analysis toolbox and nighttime light and population density data from an unspecified source.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline in this study primarily uses raster image data (NDVI and other drivers) and vector datasets (watershed boundaries, landform types, and population density). There is no mention of audio or video data formats.
