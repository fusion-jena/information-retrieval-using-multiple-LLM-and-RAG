Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the raw data used in the study discussed in the text are aerial images, as the text discusses pre-processing of imagery, segmentation and classification strategies for images, and mentions the use of historical imagery.

It can be assumed that these aerial images were collected using remote sensing technologies such as satellite or aircraft-mounted sensors. Remote sensing is a common method for collecting large-scale, high-resolution image data for use in deep learning and other image analysis tasks. Remote sensing can provide data in various parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, such as visible light, infrared, and ultraviolet, which can be used to extract different types of information from the images.

Additionally, the text mentions the use of "historical imagery" which implies that the data used in the study may have been obtained from public datasets or repositories that make remote sensing data available for research purposes.

It's important to note that the methods for collecting raw data will depend on the specific application and the type of data needed. For example, if the goal is to classify different types of vegetation, high-resolution multispectral or hyperspectral imagery would be needed. If the goal is to detect objects on the ground, high-resolution visible imagery would be sufficient.

In summary, while the text does not provide explicit information on the methods used for collecting raw data, it can be inferred that the data used in the study are aerial images, likely collected using remote sensing technologies such as satellite or aircraft-mounted sensors, and possibly obtained from public datasets.
