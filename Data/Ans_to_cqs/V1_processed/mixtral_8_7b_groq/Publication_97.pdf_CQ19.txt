The deep learning model for forest damage segmentation was implemented using the Keras framework with TensorFlow as a backend. The Keras library is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. TensorFlow, developed by Google Brain, is an open-source software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It provides a comprehensive and flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML-powered applications. In this specific implementation, the U-Net-like convolutional neural network was built on a Python-based computational environment using Keras with TensorFlow as the backend. The model training was performed on a PC with an Nvidia Tesla K80 GPU.
