The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include flip, rotation, and affine transformation. Specifically, horizontal and vertical flipping, rotations, and affine transformations were used. Additionally, multiply, linear contrast, sharpen, and emboss were also employed for heavy augmentation. These techniques help improve training performance and allow the deep learning model to successfully segment and classify various objects with high accuracy. This is particularly useful in the analysis of soil chips, where the approach can be extended to other microbial groups and used to study abundance and morphology of living organisms, as well as their interactions with additives to the ecosystem. The use of these data augmentation techniques has been made possible through resources provided by the National Academic Infrastructure for Supercomputing in Sweden and research infrastructure Correlative Image Processing and Analysis.
