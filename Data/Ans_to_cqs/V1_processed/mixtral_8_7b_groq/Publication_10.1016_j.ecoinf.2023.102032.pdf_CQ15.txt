Based on the provided context, there is no information about the specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam used in the deep learning pipeline.

The first piece of context is a URL of an article about improving cloud detection with machine learning. However, this article does not discuss the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

The second piece of context is an article citation for a study on wetland use intensity in East Africa using Sentinel-2 data. The abstract and methodology sections of this article do not mention any optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
