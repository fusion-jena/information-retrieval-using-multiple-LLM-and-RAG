The context provided discusses the methodology used to train and evaluate deep learning models, particularly Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based regression models, for detecting invasions of a specific tree species (P. radiata) using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) data. However, it does not explicitly mention the steps taken to deploy the trained model, such as model serialization or platform selection.

The process of model deployment typically involves saving the trained model in a format that can be easily loaded and used for making predictions on new data. This is often referred to as model serialization. Common libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch provide built-in functions for saving and loading models. It is likely that the Keras library, which was used to implement the models, also has similar capabilities.

Once the model is saved, it can be loaded and used in various platforms and environments, depending on the specific requirements of the application. This could range from a local machine to a cloud-based platform or an edge device. The choice of platform would depend on factors such as the volume of data to be processed, the computational resources available, and the need for real-time predictions.

However, these steps are not explicitly mentioned in the given context. The focus of the text is on the process of training and evaluating the models, rather than deploying them. Therefore, while it is possible that the models were deployed using standard practices for model serialization and platform selection, the text does not provide enough information to confirm this.
