The deep learning pipelines can utilize various data formats, including image, audio, video, and CSV, depending on the specific application and the problem being addressed. The provided context includes studies that have used image, audio, and CSV data formats in their deep learning pipelines.

In the 2016 study by He et al., "Deep residual learning for image recognition," the authors presented a deep residual learning framework for image recognition tasks. This study used the ImageNet dataset, which consists of color images that have been labeled in accordance with the WordNet hierarchy (<https://image-net.org/>). The dataset includes more than 14 million images, with 1000 object categories.

The 2021 study by Kahl et al., "BirdNET: a deep learning solution for avian diversity monitoring," used audio data in their deep learning pipeline. The authors developed BirdNET, a deep learning-based tool for bird species identification using audio recordings. They used a dataset of over 1 million annotated audio recordings, collected from multiple sources, including the Xeno-canto database (<https://xeno-canto.org/>) and the Macaulay Library at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology (<https://www.macaulaylibrary.org/>).

The 2023 study by Lublin et al., "The history of highly-pathogenic avian influenza in Israel (H5-subtypes): from 2006 to 2023," used CSV data format in their deep learning pipeline. The authors analyzed the epidemiological and genetic characteristics of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses in Israel. They used a dataset containing information on HPAI outbreaks in Israel from 2006 to 2023, which was provided by the Israeli Veterinary Services and stored in a CSV file format.

Moreover, the 2021 study by Pr√ºter et al., "Parsing birdsong with deep audio embeddings," used audio data format in their deep learning pipeline. The authors presented a deep learning-based method for parsing birdsong using deep audio embeddings. They used a dataset of over 10,000 annotated bird vocalization recordings, collected from multiple sources, including the Xeno-canto database and the Macaulay Library at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology.

In summary, the deep learning pipelines can use various data formats, including image, audio, video, and CSV, depending on the specific application and the problem being addressed. The provided context includes studies that have used image, audio, and CSV data formats in their deep learning pipelines.
