Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The study primarily discusses the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) as a platform for processing and analyzing large-scale remote sensing data for wildfire science. It mentions that the GEE platform hosts a vast data catalog and utilizes advanced image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms. However, it does not mention any specific data repository for the deep learning pipeline.

Additionally, the context discusses the FIREMAP software, which is designed as a reactive web application using JavaScript, Vue.js, Vuetify.js, and OpenLayers libraries. The software relies on an open-source relational database management system, PostgreSQL, for storing user simulations and complementary assets. However, there is no information about the deep learning pipeline's data repository.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine the data repository of the deep learning pipeline.
