The context does not provide detailed information on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention some steps and tools used during the training phase that could be part of the deployment process.

The deep learning models in the studies were trained using Python version 3.7, PyTorch library (v1.6.0), and CUDA v10.1 for GPU acceleration. Other libraries used were NumPy, Pycocotools, Cython, Matplotlib, tqdm, yacs, and OpenCV. The models were trained on a personal computer with a 1060Ti GPU and Ubuntu 20.04 operating system.

For the animal tracking tasks, a Siamese network was used, which updated the connection weights of each network layer by learning the features of the training samples. A few-shot learning method was used to train the network, as the training dataset contained an insufficient number of samples. The classification task was defined as the N-way K-shot problem, where the training set contained N different categories with each category comprising K labeled samples.

After training the model, one of the steps to deploy it could be model serialization, where the model is saved to disk in a format that can be later loaded into memory and used for making predictions. PyTorch provides the `torch.save()` function to save the entire model (including its architecture, parameters, and the optimizer's state) to a file in a single step.

Another step could be platform selection, where the trained model is deployed on a target platform for inference. The target platform could be a local machine, a server, or a cloud-based platform. The choice of platform would depend on factors such as the expected volume of inference requests, the required latency, and the available resources.

In the context of wildlife video analysis, the deployed model could be integrated with a video processing pipeline to analyze videos in real-time or near real-time. The pipeline could include steps such as video decoding, model inference, and visualization of the results.

Overall, while the context does not provide a detailed description of the deployment process, it does mention some steps and tools used during the training phase that could be part of the deployment process.
