Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention or give information about a code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. It focuses more on the methodology, results, and implications of the study related to the estimation and mapping of Above Ground Biomass (AGB) in agroforestry systems.

The authors, R.K. Singh et al., discuss the application of machine learning algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), to estimate AGB based on field data and remotely sensed optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) datasets. However, there is no reference to a code repository or any platform (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket) where the deep learning pipeline's code would be available.

To access the code repository, it would be best to contact the authors directly or look for any related publications, supplementary materials, or project websites that might have been created for this study.
