The provided context discusses the implementation of a deep learning pipeline using PyTorch Lightning and the optimization of model training using the Optuna-based hyperparameter optimization procedure. However, it does not explicitly mention the use of specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.

The context does mention that the models were trained using the L2 loss determined on the predicted and observed RGBI channels, which is a form of L2 regularization. L2 regularization adds a penalty to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients, which can help to prevent overfitting by reducing the size of the coefficients.

However, the context does not mention the use of dropout, which is another commonly used regularization method in deep learning. Dropout randomly sets a fraction of the input units to zero during training, which helps to prevent overfitting by making the model more robust and less dependent on the training data.

In summary, while the context mentions the use of L2 regularization, it does not explicitly mention the use of dropout or any other regularization methods to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
