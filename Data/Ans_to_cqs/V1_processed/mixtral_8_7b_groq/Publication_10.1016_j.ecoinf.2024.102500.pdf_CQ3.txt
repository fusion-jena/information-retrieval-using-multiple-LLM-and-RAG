The provided context does not specifically mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for water quality prediction. However, it does discuss the use of machine learning models, including artificial neural networks (ANNs), for water quality prediction in the Godavari River Basin, India.

In the context, it is mentioned that XGB, RF, and ET models were chosen based on their best performance to build a stacking-based ANN meta ML model. These models were optimized for each water quality measure using hyperparameter tuning techniques. The Lazy Predict algorithm was used to suggest machine learning models, which were then fine-tuned.

In general, data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and pixel-level annotation. These techniques are used to label and categorize data, enabling deep learning models to learn and make predictions.

For instance, in the context of water quality prediction, bounding box annotation could be used to identify and label areas of water contamination in images or video footage. Instance segmentation could be used to differentiate between different types of contaminants, while pixel-level annotation could provide even more detailed information about the location and extent of contamination.

It is important to note that the specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline will depend on the nature of the data and the problem being solved. In the context of water quality prediction, the data annotation techniques used may vary depending on the type of data collected (e.g., images, sensor data, etc.) and the specific water quality measures being predicted.

Therefore, while the provided context does not specifically mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for water quality prediction, it is likely that a variety of techniques were used to label and categorize the data used in the study.
