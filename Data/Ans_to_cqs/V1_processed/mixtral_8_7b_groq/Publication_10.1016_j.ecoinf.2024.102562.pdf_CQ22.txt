The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using two standard metrics: mean average precision (mAP) and recall. Mean average precision is the average of the weighted mean of precision of each class, and recall is the percentage of correct detected objects out of all the correct targets. In other words, recall represents the capability of detecting all the instances of the target class, while mean average precision shows how much we can trust the identified result. These metrics are used to assess the accuracy of the model in detecting objects, with recall indicating the model's ability to detect all instances of the target class, and mAP indicating the model's precision in identifying the correct targets.
