Based on the provided context, the specific deep learning model is not explicitly mentioned. However, the papers do discuss the use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and machine learning models such as GPR, LR, NN, SLR, SVM, TR, and XGB. These models are typically used for regression or classification tasks, but based on the context, it seems that the RNN model is being used for waste disposal rate estimation, which is a regression problem.

In the paper "Analysis of input set characteristics and variances on k-fold cross validation for a recurrent neural network model on waste disposal rate estimation" by Vu et al., 2022, the authors use a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model to predict waste disposal rates. They use k-fold cross-validation to evaluate the performance of the RNN model. The purpose of this study is to analyze the impact of different input set characteristics and variances on the performance of the RNN model.

In the other papers, machine learning models such as GPR, LR, NN, SLR, SVM, TR, and XGB are used for various tasks such as predicting heavy metals in soil and pollution indices in mining areas, and assessing water quality in an ecologically critical urban canal. However, the specific purpose of each model is not explicitly mentioned.

In summary, based on the provided context, the purpose of the RNN model is to predict waste disposal rates. However, the specific purpose of other machine learning models such as GPR, LR, NN, SLR, SVM, TR, and XGB is not explicitly mentioned.
