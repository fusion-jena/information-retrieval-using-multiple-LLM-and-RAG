The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a deep learning model. Instead, it refers to the use of an ensemble of machine learning models, including RandomForest, Treenet, CART, and MARS. These models are used to predict gull-abundance hotspots and coldspots based on various predictor layers, including socio-economic data from the US Census.

The specific purpose of the machine learning models is to identify the preferred habitats of Short-billed Gulls, also known as Mew Gulls (Larus canus). The models find that the gulls prefer areas near man-made water bodies, industrial areas, impervious surfaces, gravel pits, strip malls, transfer sites (garbage dumps), and some young forest vegetation.

The models are trained, tested, and evaluated using a combination of traditional multi-year field-based data collection and open-access predictor layers. The models' performance is assessed using various diagnostic tools, including partial dependence plots.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the purpose of the machine learning models is not classification, segmentation, or detection, but rather to identify the preferred habitats of Short-billed Gulls using a blended 'Big Data' approach.
