Based on the provided context, the specific type of deep learning (DL) model or task (e.g., classification, segmentation, detection) is not mentioned. However, the context does give some insights into the possible purpose of the DL model in the described study.


The deep learning model is used for automatic image processing in practical ecological applications. Specifically, it is employed for image classification, as indicated by the focus on evaluating the results using metrics suitable for classification tasks. The DL model is seen as a non-linear function with a large number of parameters, adjusted using annotated data through a supervised approach. After training, the model's performance is evaluated using an independent testing data set.

The purpose of the DL model in this context is to provide results that indicate its usefulness in practical scenarios, addressing the challenge of high classification accuracy values that might not represent the whole picture. This implies that the model should be able to identify and classify different species or objects within images accurately and reliably.

However, the exact purpose (classification, segmentation, or detection) cannot be determined from the given context. Classification is the most likely task, given the emphasis on evaluating metrics for classification. Nonetheless, the model could potentially be used for other tasks, such as object detection or semantic segmentation, if the study's objectives or methodology required it.
