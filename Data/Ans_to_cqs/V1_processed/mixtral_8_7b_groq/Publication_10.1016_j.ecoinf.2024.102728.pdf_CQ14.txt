Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context focuses on the NHC (Nested Hierarchical Classification) methodology for classifying land into spectral-based classes, information classes, and ground cover classes. It mentions the use of a simple linear regression and crosstabulation results, but it does not provide details about the optimization of hyperparameters such as grid search or random search.

However, the context does provide references to several papers that may contain information about the optimization of hyperparameters. For example, the paper by Wu, X., Irie, G., Hiramatsu, K., and Kashino, K. (2018) discusses weighted generalized mean pooling for deep image retrieval, which may involve the optimization of hyperparameters. Similarly, the paper by Xie, Y., Li, J., Zhao, L., Liu, W., Gong, Q., Deng, M., and Zhao, M. (2023) discusses an extraction method for land use and land cover classification, which may also involve the optimization of hyperparameters.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly answer the query, it is possible that the answer can be found in the references provided. Without access to the full papers, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query.
