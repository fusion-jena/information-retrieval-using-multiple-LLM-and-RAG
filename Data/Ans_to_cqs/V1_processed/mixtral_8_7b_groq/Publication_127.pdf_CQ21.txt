After training the models, several postprocessing steps were taken to evaluate their performance and analyze the results. These steps include:

1. Prediction Averaging: An ensemble of models was formed by averaging the predictions of all the trained models for each stage. This method helps improve classification accuracy.

2. Metrics Calculation: The top-1 accuracy of different models was calculated to compare their performance in detecting images containing animals. The VGG model achieved the best accuracy of 96.8% (Table 2).

3. Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix was created for the best model (VGG) to show its performance in detail. The confusion matrix provides a summary of prediction results on a classification problem. It allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm by comparing the actual and predicted classifications. SI Appendix, Fig. S10 shows the best modelâ€™s confusion matrix.

4. Visualization of Misclassified Images: Several examples for the best model (VGG) were shown in SI Appendix, Results on the Volunteer-Labeled Test Set. This step aimed to demonstrate the difficulty of the task and where the models currently fail.

No specific mention of saliency maps was found in the provided context. Saliency maps are a common tool used in computer vision to highlight the regions of an image that are most important for a specific task or model decision. However, the context does not mention their usage in this particular study.

In summary, after training the models, the postprocessing steps involved prediction averaging, metrics calculation, confusion matrix generation, visualization of misclassified images, and possibly saliency map generation (although not explicitly mentioned in the provided context).
