The provided context does not give specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for ecological informatics. However, it does mention the use of various datasets in modeling and analyzing species distribution and ecological patterns.

One such dataset is related to pine wilt disease, which is a major issue affecting pine trees in various regions. The dataset consists of environmental variables, such as elevation, slope, distance to road, annual mean temperature, minimum temperature in January, maximum temperature in July, and annual precipitation. These variables were extracted from digital maps using a geographic information system (GIS) program (ArcGIS 10.1; ESRI). Digital maps for elevation and slope were obtained from the National Geographic Information Institute of Korea (<http://www.ngii.go.kr>). Additionally, the dataset includes the proportion of land-use types categorized into seven classes: urban area, agriculture land, forest, grassland, wetland, barren area, and water.

Another study used airborne spectral imagery for detecting pine wilt disease. The authors developed a machine learning approach to detect the disease using remote sensing data. While the context does not explicitly mention the data collection method, it can be inferred that the data was collected using airborne sensors.

In summary, the provided context suggests that various datasets are used in ecological informatics, including those derived from digital maps, remote sensing data, and potentially other public datasets. However, specific details about the data collection methods for deep learning pipelines are not provided.

 
In the field of ecological informatics, various datasets are used for modeling and analyzing species distribution and ecological patterns. These datasets are derived from different sources, such as digital maps, remote sensing data, and potentially other public datasets. For instance, a dataset related to pine wilt disease includes environmental variables extracted from digital maps using a GIS program and the proportion of land-use types. Another study used airborne spectral imagery for detecting pine wilt disease, implying the use of airborne sensors for data collection. However, specific details about the data collection methods for deep learning pipelines are not provided in the given context.
