The performance of the deep learning model in the context provided is evaluated using the following metrics: sensitivity, specificity, the true skill statistic (TSS), and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). These metrics are used to quantitatively assess the species distribution models (SDMs) by measuring how accurately the model classifies given environmental variables at presence and absence locations.

Sensitivity, also known as recall, measures the proportion of actual positives that were correctly identified. Specificity, on the other hand, measures the proportion of actual negatives that were correctly identified. The true skill statistic (TSS) is a threshold-dependent accuracy measure that combines both sensitivity and specificity into a single metric. It ranges from -1 to 1, where a value of 1 indicates perfect accuracy, a value of 0 indicates no better than random guessing, and a value less than 0 indicates worse than random guessing.

The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) is a threshold-independent accuracy measure that measures the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes. It ranges from 0 to 1, where a value of 1 indicates perfect accuracy, a value of 0.5 indicates no better than random guessing, and a value less than 0.5 indicates worse than random guessing.

In the study, the deep learning model (ANN) was compared to other SDMs, and the AUC and TSS metrics were used to evaluate their performance. The proposed ensemble teacher model-based SDM (SDP-EPL) showed the best AUC score of 0.953, followed by the single-teacher model-based SDM (SDP-SPL) with an AUC score of 0.841. The ANN model had an AUC score of 0.789, which was lower than both SDP-EPL and SDP-SPL.

In summary, the performance of the deep learning model in the study was evaluated using the sensitivity, specificity, TSS, and AUC metrics. These metrics were used to assess the model's ability to accurately classify presence and absence locations of the target species based on given environmental variables. The proposed ensemble teacher model-based SDM (SDP-EPL) showed the best performance, followed by the single-teacher model-based SDM (SDP-SPL) and the ANN model.
