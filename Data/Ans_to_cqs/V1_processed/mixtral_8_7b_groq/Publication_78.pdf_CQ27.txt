The provided context does not give specific details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does provide information about the training of the model.

The deep learning model in question is a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) named CoralNet, which was trained to classify features of coral reefs as either bleached or healthy. The training parameters of CoralNet include the Adam optimizer, 10 epochs, a batch size of 64, and cross-entropy as the loss function.

The input image size for CoralNet is 227 × 227 × 3, and it has a total of 13 layers, including three convolutional layers (Conv2D), two max-pooling (MaxPooling2D) layers, two dense layers, one flatten layer, and three activation layers. The activation layers use rectified linear unit (ReLU) as the activation function, except for the last layer, which uses softmax as the activation function.

The features are extracted from the input image using Conv2D layers, and the feature vector is obtained at the last layer. The context also mentions that the model was trained using handcrafted features as well as spatial features extracted from the input image.

Therefore, while the context does not provide specific details about the deployment process, it does provide information about the training of the CoralNet model.
