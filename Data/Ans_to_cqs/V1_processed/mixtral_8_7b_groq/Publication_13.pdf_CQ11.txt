The provided context does not include information about a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text describes a study that uses single-specimen photographs taken from bulk samples to predict local high-resolution images. The study employed between-datasets classification with domain adversarial training, using the domain adversarial training of neural networks (DANN) method. The DANN model jointly predicts the class label of the source images and the dataset (domain) of all input images.

The authors used a subset of single specimens, which were photographed using a conventional stereoscope NIKON SMZ1270i equipped with a NIKON DS-Fi3 Microscope Camera. These images were denoted as the Local Low Quality (LL) dataset. The neural network was trained with the stochastic gradient descent algorithm with the softmax cross-entropy loss for 300 epochs.

However, the context does not provide information about the data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It is possible that the data is not publicly available or that the authors did not provide a link to the repository in the text. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
