The deep learning pipeline can utilize various data formats, including image, audio, video, and CSV, depending on the specific application and problem being addressed. In the context of the provided pieces of information, the primary data formats used are satellite images and in-situ measured data.

Satellite images are one of the most common data formats in remote sensing and Earth observation applications. These images are captured using multispectral sensors, such as the MSI (Mediated Spectral Imager) and OLCI (Ocean and Land Colour Instrument), which record reflected light across multiple spectral bands (blue, green, red, and near-infrared). The images have different spatial resolutions, ranging from 10 meters for the blue, green, and red bands to 20 or 300 meters for the near-infrared band. These multispectral images are used to analyze various environmental and ecological features, such as atmospheric correction, water quality classification, and terrestrial influence in coastal areas.

In-situ measured data is another important data format in the deep learning pipeline. This data is collected from ground-based or water-based sensors and provides direct, localized measurements of various environmental parameters. In-situ data can be used for validation, calibration, or development of algorithms that complement satellite image analysis. For example, in-situ measured data can be used to develop and validate algorithms for chlorophyll-a retrieval in small inland water targets or to analyze the terrestrial influence in Baltic Sea coastal areas.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention other data formats like audio, video, or CSV, it is important to note that these formats can also be used in deep learning pipelines, depending on the specific application. For instance, audio data can be used for sound analysis and classification, video data for object detection or tracking, and CSV files for structured data analysis, such as time-series analysis or machine learning on tabular data.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline can utilize various data formats, including satellite images and in-situ measured data, as described in the provided context. However, other data formats like audio, video, and CSV can also be used in deep learning pipelines, depending on the specific application and problem being addressed.
