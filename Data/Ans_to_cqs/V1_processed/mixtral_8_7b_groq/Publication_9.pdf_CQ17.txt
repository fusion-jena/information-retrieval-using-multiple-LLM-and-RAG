Regularization methods are techniques used in deep learning to prevent overfitting, which occurs when a model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data. Overfitting is often caused by the model being too complex, allowing it to learn the noise in the training data. Regularization methods help to reduce the complexity of the model and improve its generalization ability.

Two commonly used regularization methods in deep learning are dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a regularization technique introduced by Srivastava et al. (2014) that randomly drops out, or sets to zero, a proportion of the neurons in a layer during training. This prevents the neurons from co-adapting too much to the training data and reduces overfitting. Dropout has been shown to improve the performance of deep neural networks in various applications, including image classification (He et al., 2015; He et al., 2016) and object detection (Girshick, 2015).

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is a regularization technique that adds a penalty term to the loss function, proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model weights. This encourages the model to have smaller weights, reducing the complexity of the model and preventing overfitting. L2 regularization has been used in various deep learning models, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) (Pascanu et al., 2013).

In summary, dropout and L2 regularization are two commonly used regularization methods in deep learning to prevent overfitting. Dropout randomly drops out a proportion of the neurons in a layer during training, while L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model weights. These methods help to reduce the complexity of the model and improve its generalization ability.
