The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is classification. The model is designed to classify water body images into specific water quality levels. To accomplish this, the researchers used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the AlexNet architecture, which is known for its effectiveness in image scene classification tasks.

The CNN model consists of five convolutional layers, one pooling layer, and three fully connected layers. The convolutional layers are used to extract or detect features from the input images, while the pooling layer reduces the dimensionality of the feature map. The fully connected layers are used for the final classification, categorizing the input images into one of the three water quality level labels: Class I, Class II, or Class III.

To enhance the model's reliability, a dropout function was incorporated between the fully connected layers. This function randomly drops out a number of output features during training, which helps to prevent overfitting and improves the model's generalization ability.

The training of the model was conducted over 500 epochs, with the learning rate initially set at 0.1 and then halved every 20 rounds. This learning rate adjustment strategy helps to optimize the model's performance by finding the most effective model weights for each cycle.

Therefore, the deep learning model in this study is specifically designed for image classification, with the goal of accurately categorizing water body images based on their water quality levels.
