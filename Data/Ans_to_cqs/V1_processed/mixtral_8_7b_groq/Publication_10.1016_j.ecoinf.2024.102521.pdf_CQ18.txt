The strategy for monitoring model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that users can train models locally using the programs available in the STARdbi website. Therefore, it can be inferred that the responsibility of monitoring model performance during training falls on the users.

Typically, monitoring model performance during training involves tracking metrics such as loss and accuracy over each epoch or batch of training data. This allows users to identify if the model is overfitting or underfitting, and adjust the training parameters accordingly.

In the context of STARdbi, it is mentioned that they have implemented a modular classification scheme, where they gradually build and add custom-made AI-based classification models. It can be assumed that they have a strategy in place to monitor the performance of these models before adding them to the database. However, the specifics of this strategy are not provided.

Additionally, the context mentions that STARdbi aims to implement the training of high-resolution classification models, storing them in the database, and applying them to the database. It is possible that a monitoring strategy will be implemented as part of these features.

Overall, while the specific strategy for monitoring model performance during training is not provided in the context, it is mentioned that users can train models locally and that STARdbi has a modular classification scheme. It can be inferred that users are responsible for monitoring model performance during local training, while STARdbi likely has a strategy in place to monitor the performance of models before adding them to the database.
