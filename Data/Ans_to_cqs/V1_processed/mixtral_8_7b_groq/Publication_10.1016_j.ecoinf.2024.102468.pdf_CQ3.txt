Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, the context does mention the use of annotated data in the form of manual detections of annotations within a library of calls, including Bm-Ant-A and Bm-Ant-Z calls. The annotations are distributed unevenly among various sites, and the number of manual detections and percentage of hours with each type of call annotation vary across sites.

The context also mentions the use of open access data and annotations from the IWC-SORP/SOOS annotated library, which could potentially include information on the data annotation techniques used. However, the provided text does not include specific details on the annotation techniques.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to the query about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
