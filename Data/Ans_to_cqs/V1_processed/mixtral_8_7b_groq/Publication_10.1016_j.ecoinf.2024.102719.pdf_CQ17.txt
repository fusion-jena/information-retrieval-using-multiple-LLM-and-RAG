In summary, L2 regularization and dropout are two common regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting and improve generalizability. L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, while dropout randomly removes neurons during training. These techniques can be applied to various deep learning architectures and help ensure that predictive models perform well on unseen data.
