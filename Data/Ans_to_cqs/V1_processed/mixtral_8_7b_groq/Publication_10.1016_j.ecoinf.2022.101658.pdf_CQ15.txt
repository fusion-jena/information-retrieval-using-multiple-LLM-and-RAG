The deep learning pipeline in the study mentioned uses the Adam optimization algorithm. This information can be inferred from the description of the training process for the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). The study states that the cross-entropy loss was used as the objective function for training the network, and the Adam optimizer was utilized for updating the trainable parameters. Therefore, it can be concluded that the Adam optimization technique is applied in this deep learning pipeline.

The Adam optimizer is a popular optimization algorithm in deep learning due to its efficiency and adaptability. It combines the advantages of two other optimization methods, AdaGrad and RMSProp, by using the estimated first moment (the mean) and the second moment (the uncentered variance) of the gradient. Adam adjusts the learning rate for each parameter individually, making it suitable for complex optimization problems, such as those encountered in deep learning.

In contrast, the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer is a simpler optimization algorithm that updates model parameters by computing the gradient of the loss function concerning a single training example (or a mini-batch of examples). While SGD can be effective for some problems, it generally requires more fine-tuning and can converge slower than adaptive methods like Adam.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline in the study uses the Adam optimization algorithm, as stated in the description of the training process for the DCNN. The Adam optimizer is a popular and efficient method for optimizing deep learning models, offering adaptive learning rates for individual parameters.
