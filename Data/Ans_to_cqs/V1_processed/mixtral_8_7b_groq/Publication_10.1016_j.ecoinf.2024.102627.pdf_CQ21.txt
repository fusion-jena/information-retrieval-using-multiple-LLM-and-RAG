Based on the provided context, there are two postprocessing steps involved after the model training:

1. Removing predictions outside the continents where species are known to occur: This step involves removing any predictions of species occurrences that fall outside the continents where the species are known to occur, according to the observation dataset used in the study. This helps to ensure that the predictions are ecologically meaningful and relevant.

2. Normalizing conditional probabilities associated with orchids: This step involves normalizing the conditional probabilities associated with orchids in the species assemblages. The conditional probabilities refer to the probability of a species occurring given the presence of other species in the assemblage. Normalizing these probabilities helps to ensure that they add up to 1, which is useful for comparing the relative likelihoods of different species occurring in the same assemblage.

The context does not mention any other postprocessing steps such as generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, or creating confusion matrices. Saliency maps are typically used to visualize the importance of different input features in making a prediction, while metrics and confusion matrices are used to evaluate the performance of a model. It is possible that these steps were not performed in this study, or they were performed but not mentioned in the provided context.
