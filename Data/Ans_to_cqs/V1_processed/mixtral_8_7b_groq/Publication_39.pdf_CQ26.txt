The provided context discusses the data preprocessing methods used in a specific deep learning pipeline for action recognition, but it does not directly mention techniques to address data bias such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling. However, it does mention that the annotated dataset AnnotationsActions is split randomly into a train set, validation set, and test set, with the test set and validation set each including 20% of the video clips of each class. This could be considered a form of stratified splitting, as the class distribution is maintained in each subset.

Additionally, the context describes the use of data augmentation techniques such as horizontal flips, adding or subtracting intensity, Gaussian blur, additive Gaussian noise, and fog simulation. These techniques can help increase the diversity of the training data and reduce overfitting, but they do not directly address data bias.

It is important to note that addressing data bias is a crucial step in building fair and unbiased machine learning models. Techniques such as oversampling minority classes, undersampling majority classes, or using a combination of both (e.g., SMOTE), as well as collecting diverse data, can help reduce bias in the training data. However, these techniques are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, while the provided context does mention some data preprocessing techniques, it does not specifically address data bias.
