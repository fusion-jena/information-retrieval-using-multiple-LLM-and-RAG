Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, the context does provide information about various datasets derived from Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 satellite data, which are used for different remote sensing applications.

The datasets derived from Sentinel-2 include:

* Batch 1: Visible (red, green, and blue) bands of Sentinel-2 data
* Batch 2: Twelve multispectral (MS) bands of Sentinel-2 data
* Batch 3: MS bands + spectral indices
* Batch 4: MS bands + spectral features + Sentinel-1 bands
* Batch 5: MS bands + spectral features + textural features + Sentinel-1 bands
* Batch 6: MS bands + spectral features + textural features + Sentinel-1 bands + Digital Surface Model (DSM)

Additionally, there are other datasets derived from Sentinel-1 and other sources, such as:

* Sentinel-1 data with VV-VH-VV color composite
* AW3D30
* RedEdge1-RedEdge2-RedEdge3 color composite of Sentinel-2 data
* RedEdge4-SWIR1-SWIR2 color composite of Sentinel-2 data

These datasets are used for various applications such as glacier segmentation, crop mapping, yield estimation, water surface mapping, and neural network and support vector machine for chronic kidney disease prediction.

Therefore, while the provided context does not directly answer the query about the deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, it does provide information about various remote sensing datasets derived from Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 satellite data.
