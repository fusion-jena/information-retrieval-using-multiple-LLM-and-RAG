The deep learning model in this case was built using the TensorFlow framework, version 2.4.1. This information is provided in the context, which states that the system was built under Python 3.9.5 using TensorFlow 2.4.1. No other frameworks are mentioned in the context, so it can be concluded that only TensorFlow was used in this particular case.

It is worth noting that there are several other popular frameworks for building deep learning models, such as PyTorch, Keras, and Caffe. The choice of framework often depends on the specific needs and preferences of the research team, as well as the complexity of the model being built. For example, PyTorch is known for its flexibility and ease of use, while TensorFlow is often praised for its scalability and performance.

In this case, the research team chose TensorFlow, which is a widely-used and well-supported framework for building deep learning models. TensorFlow provides a comprehensive suite of tools for designing, training, and deploying machine learning models, and it has a large and active community of users and developers.

The team also used the Stochastic Gradient Descendent (SGD) method for learning, optimizing its parameters and binary cross-entropy as a loss function. Additionally, they tuned the parameters with Bayesian optimization and ensured that the standard deviation of the predicted probabilities exceeds a certain threshold. These techniques are commonly used in deep learning to improve the accuracy and robustness of the models.

Overall, the team used a standard methodology and a widely-used framework to build their deep learning model. This approach allowed them to take advantage of the growing computing capability of machines and the availability of big data to extract high levels of representation of image content.
