The provided context does not include information about the performance metrics used to evaluate the deep learning model mentioned in the query. The context focuses on the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) fitness test and the reliability analysis of the CFA (Confirmatory Factor Analysis) model.

The SEM fitness test includes various metrics such as Ï‡2/df, GFI, RMSEA, RMR, CFI, NFI, TLI, and IFI. However, these metrics are used to evaluate the fit of the SEM model to the data and not for assessing the performance of a deep learning model.

Similarly, the CFA reliability analysis includes the Cronbach alpha coefficient and KMO test, which are used to assess the reliability and validity of the CFA model construct.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to answer the query regarding the performance metrics used for the deep learning model.
