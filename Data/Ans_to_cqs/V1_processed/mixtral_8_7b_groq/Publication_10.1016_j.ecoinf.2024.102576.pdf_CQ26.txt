The provided texts do not give specific information about techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, they do mention some preprocessing steps and techniques related to data acquisition and preparation for deep learning models in the context of land use and land cover classification.

For instance, Jagannathan and Divya (2021) use a deep convolutional neural network for the prediction and classification of land use and land cover changes. They mention the labeling part of their process, which determines the labeling methodology for training the deep learning model. Kim et al. (2021a) discuss the use of phenological characteristics for classification, even in the absence of specific classes. They also mention that classification accuracy and performance improved as data increased during the training of a deep learning model using satellite imageries over multiple periods (Kim et al., 2021b).

In the context of data bias, techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection can be used to address data bias during preprocessing. Stratified splitting involves dividing the data into subgroups or strata based on certain characteristics, and then randomly sampling from each stratum to ensure representation. Oversampling refers to increasing the number of samples from a minority class, while undersampling involves reducing the number of samples from a majority class. Diverse data collection involves gathering data from various sources and ensuring that the data is representative of the target population.

However, the provided texts do not explicitly mention the use of these techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing. It is possible that these techniques were not used in the studies mentioned, or that they were not highlighted in the texts. Therefore, while we can infer some preprocessing steps and techniques from the provided context, we cannot definitively answer the query about techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing without additional information.
