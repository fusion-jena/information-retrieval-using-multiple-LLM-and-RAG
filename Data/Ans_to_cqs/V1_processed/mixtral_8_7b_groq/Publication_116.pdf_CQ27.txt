Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the model was likely serialized and then run on a specific platform for the experiments.

The context describes a deep learning experiment where a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to determine if the SSPB (Sustainable Society Project Berlin) introduces a significant bias. The dataset used for this experiment is called D, but there is no information about how the trained model was deployed.

However, it can be inferred that the trained model was serialized, which is the process of saving the model's architecture, weights, and biases to a file. This is a common practice in deep learning to ensure that the trained model can be easily shared, reused, and deployed.

Furthermore, it can be inferred that the serialized model was run on a specific platform for the experiments. The context describes the use of various deep learning operations, such as convolution, batch normalization, LRN, and max pooling, which are commonly used in deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras. Therefore, it can be inferred that the trained model was deployed on a platform that supports these deep learning operations.

In summary, while there is no explicit information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, it can be inferred that the model was likely serialized and run on a specific platform for the experiments. However, the exact details of the deployment process are not provided in the context.
