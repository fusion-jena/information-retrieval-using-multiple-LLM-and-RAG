The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the parameter selection for the model was performed by minimizing the mean squared error. This suggests that the model performance was being evaluated using this error metric during the training process. Additionally, the authors acknowledge the lack of temporal data for model performance evaluation, implying that they were aware of the importance of monitoring the model's ability to predict future values. It can be inferred that standard practices for monitoring model performance during training, such as using validation and test datasets, were likely employed. However, further information is needed to provide a definitive answer.
