In summary, the primary source of raw data in this deep learning pipeline is remote sensing data from the Sentinel-2 satellite. Image processing techniques such as thresholding and filtering are applied to the data to extract meaningful information. However, the context does not provide specific details about other methods used for collecting raw data, such as surveys or public datasets.
