The provided context does not contain information about the specific framework or software used to build the deep learning model. The text describes the construction of a three-layer backpropagation artificial neural network (BP ANN) for predicting total suspended solids (TSI) using water sample data. The network was built using MATLAB R2014b, which is a general-purpose programming language and environment for numerical computation, rather than a deep learning-specific framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine the framework used for the deep learning model.
