Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context includes information about the methods and techniques used in the study, such as the use of DeepLabv3+ with COCO classes, Conditional Random Fields, and Binarization of results. However, it does not include any information about where the data used in the study is stored or how it can be accessed.

It is possible that the data used in the study is not publicly available or that it was not stored in a public repository. In some cases, researchers may choose not to make their data publicly available due to privacy concerns or other issues.

If you are interested in accessing the data used in the study, I would recommend reaching out to the authors directly to inquire about the availability of the data. They may be able to provide you with more information about where the data can be found or how it can be accessed.

Another option would be to search for open image datasets that are relevant to the study. The context mentions that open image datasets have been important for the evolution of deep learning-based methods for semantic segmentation and object detection. There are many open image datasets available that could be used for similar studies, and you may be able to find one that is suitable for your purposes.

In summary, while there is no direct mention of a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study, it is possible that the data is not publicly available or that it was not stored in a public repository. I would recommend reaching out to the authors or searching for open image datasets that are relevant to the study as potential alternatives for accessing the data.
