The purpose of the deep learning model, as described in the given context, is object detection and classification within images. The model is specifically used for identifying and classifying insects on stick-traps in a tomato crop. This is evident from the sources that discuss the use of deep learning for insect ecoinformatics and the detection and classification of insects on stick-traps (Gerovichev et al., 2018; Nieuwenhuizen et al., 2018).

The model is built using deep neural networks (DNNs), and particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are known for their ability to extract abstract high-level features from images (Miao et al., 2019). The deep learning model considers both the problems of identifying objects within the image and classifying them simultaneously, utilizing methods such as "Faster R-CNN" and YOLO (Redmon et al., 2016; Ren et al., 2015).

The model's performance is evaluated based on recall and precision metrics, which are essential for understanding the trade-offs between the number of true positive detections and false positives. The tables provided in the context illustrate the types of recall and precision errors made by the model when the confidence threshold is set to 0.7. The model rarely confuses between the three focal insect species, but it does make false positive predictions, particularly for the class "Psyllaephagus." Most of the missed predictions, however, are false negatives (tables 3 and 4).

In summary, the deep learning model is designed for the purpose of detecting and classifying insects in images of stick-traps in a tomato crop. The primary goal is to improve the accuracy of insect identification, which can aid in pest management and crop protection.
