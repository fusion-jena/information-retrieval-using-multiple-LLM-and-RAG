The provided context discusses various models and methods used in the field of deep learning, particularly in the context of bird species identification. However, it does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer based on the given context.

However, in the general context of deep learning, raw data can be collected using various methods. Some common methods include:

1. Surveys: These can be conducted to collect data from a large number of participants. Surveys can be conducted online, on paper, or through other means. They can be used to collect data on a wide variety of topics, including opinions, behaviors, and experiences.

2. Sensors: Sensors can be used to collect data on physical phenomena, such as temperature, pressure, and motion. Sensors can be attached to objects or worn by individuals to collect data in real-time.

3. Public datasets: There are many public datasets available that can be used for deep learning. These datasets cover a wide range of topics and can be a valuable resource for researchers and developers.

4. Crowdsourcing: Crowdsourcing is the practice of obtaining input or content from a large number of people, often via the internet. Crowdsourcing can be used to collect data on a wide variety of topics, including images, audio, and text.

5. Scraping: Data can be collected by scraping websites or other online sources. This involves using automated tools to extract data from web pages or APIs.

It's important to note that the specific methods used for collecting raw data will depend on the problem being solved and the type of data needed.
