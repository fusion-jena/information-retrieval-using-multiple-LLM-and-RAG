Based on the provided context, there are no specific details about the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the water quality and ecological health assessment or the forecasting nitrate decomposition in blast furnaces. However, it is mentioned that the data from the first eight days were used as the training set and the data from the last two days were used as the validation set.

In the context of the machine learning models, the training process involves optimizing the model's parameters to minimize the error on the training data. Once the model's parameters have been optimized, the model is evaluated on the validation set to estimate how well it will perform on unseen data.

One common criterion used to determine when training is complete is when the validation loss plateaus or starts to increase, indicating that the model is starting to overfit to the training data. Overfitting occurs when the model has learned the noise and outliers in the training data, resulting in poor generalization to new data.

In the context of the WTD-GWO-SVR method, the model's performance is evaluated based on the R2 (%), MSE (%), and MAE (%) metrics for both the training and validation phases. The best evaluation results for each algorithm are highlighted in bold in Table 6. The third input combination, Tem, Ec, Tur, and H, was selected as the prediction inputs, achieving the highest R2 as well as the lowest MSE and MAE in both the training and validation phases.

Therefore, while the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete are not provided in the context, it can be inferred that the model's performance on the validation set was used to evaluate the model's generalization ability and prevent overfitting.
