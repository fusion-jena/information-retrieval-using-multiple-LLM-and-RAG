Based on the provided context, there is no specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline mentioned. The sources cited focus on the application and success of deep learning techniques in predicting soil carbon and ecological components, but they do not provide a direct link to a code repository.

However, the context does mention the use of the Keras library for R, which can be used to implement deep learning models. The Keras library for R has its own repository available at <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=keras>. This library can be used to build and train deep learning models for various applications, including soil carbon prediction and ecological analysis.

In addition, the R language and environment for statistical computing, R Core Team (2019), is also mentioned as a tool for implementing these models. R is a popular programming language for statistical computing and graphics, and it has a large community of users and developers contributing packages and code repositories. Users can search for deep learning-related code repositories on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket by searching for terms like "deep learning R" or "Keras R."

An example of a deep learning-related code repository for soil carbon prediction is the 'soilDeepC' package available at <https://github.com/ganslab/soilDeepC>. This package provides a deep learning model for predicting soil organic carbon content based on soil and environmental data.

In summary, while there is no specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context, the Keras library for R and the R language itself can be used to implement deep learning models for various applications. Users can search for deep learning-related code repositories on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. An example of a deep learning code repository for soil carbon prediction is the 'soilDeepC' package available at <https://github.com/ganslab/soilDeepC>.
