Deep learning models can handle various types of data formats, including images and text, as mentioned in the context. However, it does not explicitly specify other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV.

In the context, the comparison is made between XGBoost and deep learning models, focusing on their differences in handling structured and unstructured data. Structured data refers to Fv/Fm and vegetation indices, while unstructured data includes images. Since deep learning models are capable of handling unstructured data like images, it can be inferred that they can also process other unstructured data formats such as audio and video.

Moreover, deep learning models typically require substantial datasets to achieve optimal results, implying that they can work with large-scale data in different formats. For instance, when dealing with spatially and sparse disjointed registrations from satellites like GOSAT and OCO-2, deep learning models can accommodate such data.

Furthermore, deep learning models often leverage artificial neural networks with multiple layers, which can adapt to a larger footprint size. This flexibility allows deep learning models to process different data formats efficiently.

However, it is essential to note that the context does not explicitly list audio, video, or CSV as data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, while it can be inferred that deep learning models can process various data formats based on the given information, a direct confirmation is not available in the context.
