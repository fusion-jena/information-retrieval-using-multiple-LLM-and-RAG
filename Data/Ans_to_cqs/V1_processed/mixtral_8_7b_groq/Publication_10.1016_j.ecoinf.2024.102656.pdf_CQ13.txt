I'm sorry for any confusion, but the provided context does not include information about a deep learning model. The text discusses various models such as GLM, MaxEnt, RF, GBM, and MARS, but it does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. The hyperparameters for a deep learning model typically include learning rate, optimizer, number of layers, number of neurons, batch size, and activation function, among others. However, I cannot provide specific hyperparameters used in this case because they are not mentioned in the context.
