The provided context does not give specific information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. While it mentions the use of a Tesla K80 GPU for training and the testing of data augmentation through random flips and translations, it does not explicitly mention the use of techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this query.
