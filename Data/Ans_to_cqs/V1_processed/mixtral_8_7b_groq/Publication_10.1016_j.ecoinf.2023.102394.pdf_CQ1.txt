Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer some possible data collection methods from the context.

In the context of a review of deep learning techniques used in agriculture (Attri et al., 2023), it is mentioned that a set of 2207 Soil Organic Carbon Stocks (SOCS) at depths from 0 to 20 cm from 2010 to 2014 was retrieved from a database. This suggests that SOCS data were collected using sensors or other methods to measure soil properties at different depths and times.

In another study, Wadoux et al. (2019) used multi-source data integration for soil mapping using deep learning. While the context does not provide specific details on the data sources, it is likely that the data were collected from various public datasets, sensors, or surveys.

Additionally, Xu et al. (2019) published a dataset of carbon density in Chinese terrestrial ecosystems (2010s), which could be used as a public dataset for deep learning applications.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it is likely that data are collected from a variety of sources, including sensors, surveys, and public datasets.
