Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the specific datasets (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet) used in the deep learning pipelines for coral reef studies. However, it is mentioned that various machine learning approaches, including deep learning, have been used in quantitative studies related to coral reefs. These studies have primarily focused on coral species identification, reef community status, and habitat mapping.

For instance, Villon et al. (2021) used underwater spectral images to classify fish species with limited data, which could involve deep learning techniques. Similarly, Do and Tran (2023) combined a deep learning model with an optimization algorithm to detect the dispersal of early stages of spotted butterfish in northern Vietnam under global warming. Barve et al. (2023), Da Silveira et al. (2021), and other studies have applied machine learning, including deep learning, for habitat mapping in support of coastal management.

In summary, while the specific datasets used in deep learning pipelines for coral reef studies are not mentioned in the provided context, it is clear that deep learning has been used in various quantitative studies related to coral reefs, primarily for coral species identification, reef community status, and habitat mapping.
