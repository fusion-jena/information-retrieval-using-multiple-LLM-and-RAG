Based on the provided context, there is not enough information to accurately describe the process that was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context mainly focuses on presenting an equation for calculating the number of training samples required for image classification in a racy assessment.

However, I can provide a general overview of the steps typically involved in deploying a trained deep learning model:

1. Model serialization: This step involves saving the trained model to a file or database. Model serialization is essential for deploying the model in a production environment, as it allows you to store and load the model as needed. Common serialization formats include HDF5, JSON, and Protocol Buffers.

2. Platform selection: The choice of platform for deploying the model depends on the specific use case and infrastructure requirements. Common deployment platforms include cloud services (e.g., AWS SageMaker, Google Cloud AI Platform, and Microsoft Azure Machine Learning), on-premises servers, and edge devices.

3. Model optimization: To ensure efficient deployment, it's essential to optimize the model for the target platform. Model optimization techniques include quantization, pruning, and distillation. These techniques help reduce the model size and computational requirements, making it easier to deploy on resource-constrained devices.

4. Integration with applications: Once the model is optimized and deployed, it needs to be integrated with the application that will use it. This may involve creating APIs, libraries, or custom software to facilitate communication between the model and the application.

5. Monitoring and maintenance: After deployment, it's crucial to monitor the model's performance and maintain it as needed. Monitoring helps identify issues, such as concept drift or performance degradation, while maintenance involves updating the model or infrastructure to address these issues.

Based on the given context, it is not possible to determine if these steps were followed or if any specific processes were used for deploying the trained deep learning model.
