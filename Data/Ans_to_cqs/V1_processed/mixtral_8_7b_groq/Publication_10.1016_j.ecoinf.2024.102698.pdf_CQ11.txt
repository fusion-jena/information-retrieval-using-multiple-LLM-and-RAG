Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model to create synthetic connectivity data for the restoration of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), but it does not mention where this data is stored or shared. Therefore, I am unable to provide a specific link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other data repository.
