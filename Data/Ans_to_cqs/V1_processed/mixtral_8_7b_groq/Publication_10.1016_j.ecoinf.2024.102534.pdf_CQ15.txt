The provided context does not include information about deep learning pipelines or optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query.

However, I can give some background information on optimization techniques in deep learning. Optimization techniques are used to minimize the loss function in a deep learning model, which measures the difference between the predicted and actual values. Some popular optimization techniques include:

1. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD): This is a simple optimization algorithm that updates the model parameters by taking a step in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function.
2. Adam: This is an adaptive optimization algorithm that adjusts the learning rate for each parameter based on the past gradients. It combines the advantages of two other optimization algorithms, AdaGrad and RMSProp.
3. Adagrad: This is an optimization algorithm that adapts the learning rate for each parameter based on the past gradients. It is particularly useful for sparse data.
4. Adadelta: This is an optimization algorithm that adapts the learning rate based on the running average of the past squared gradients.
5. RMSProp: This is an optimization algorithm that adjusts the learning rate based on the exponentially decaying average of the past squared gradients.

These optimization techniques are widely used in deep learning pipelines to improve the model's performance and convergence. However, the specific optimization technique used depends on the problem at hand and the data available.
