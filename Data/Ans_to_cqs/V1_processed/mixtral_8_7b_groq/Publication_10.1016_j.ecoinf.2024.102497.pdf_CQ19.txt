The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The articles focus on the application of machine learning techniques, specifically CART (Classification and Regression Tree) and Random Forest Regression (RFR), to predict wetland area, depth, and coastal water bathymetry.

In the third piece of context, it is mentioned that the CART algorithm was imported from the ‘sklearn’ library in Python, but this does not necessarily imply the use of deep learning frameworks. 'Sklearn' is a general machine learning library for Python, which includes various algorithms for classification, regression, and clustering, but it does not specialize in deep learning.

In summary, based on the given context, deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch are not used for building the models in these studies. Instead, they focus on using machine learning techniques such as CART and RFR, implemented through libraries like 'sklearn' in Python.
