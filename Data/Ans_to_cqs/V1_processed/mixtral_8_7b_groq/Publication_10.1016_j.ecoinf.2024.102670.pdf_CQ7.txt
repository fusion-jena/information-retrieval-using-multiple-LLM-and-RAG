The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets are not specified in the provided contexts. However, generally, there are some common practices for splitting the data.

The most common approach is to split the data into three sets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune the model's hyperparameters and select the best model, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final model's performance.

The data split ratio can vary depending on the size of the dataset and the specific problem. A common split ratio is 60-20-20, where 60% of the data is used for training, 20% for validation, and 20% for testing. Another common split ratio is 70-15-15 or 80-10-10.

In some cases, cross-validation is used instead of a single split. Cross-validation involves splitting the data into k folds, where k is a positive integer. The model is then trained k times, each time using a different fold as the validation set and the remaining k-1 folds as the training set. The average performance across the k runs is then used as the final performance measure.

In the context of Sharma et al. (2017), it is not clear how they split the data for training their deep learning model. However, they used crowd-sourcing to obtain manual annotation for karyotyping images of chromosomes, which they used as ground truth data.

In the context of Lasser and Katifori (2017), they introduced a new framework for the vectorization and examination of network data but did not mention how they split the data for training their model.

In the context of Ledoux et al. (2022), they predicted and experimentally validated the optimization of the angular branching process in the thallus growth of Podospora anserina. However, they did not use deep learning methods or mention how they split the data.

In the context of Gillette et al. (2023), they introduced BigNeuron, a resource to benchmark and predict the performance of algorithms for automated tracing of neurons in light microscopy datasets. They used a dataset of 12,813 manually annotated neurons and split it into training, validation, and testing sets. However, they did not mention the specific split ratio.

Therefore, while the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not provided in the given contexts, it is important to split the data appropriately to ensure the model's generalization and performance.
