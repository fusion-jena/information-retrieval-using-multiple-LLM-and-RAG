Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling in the deep learning pipeline. However, the text does discuss the use of transfer learning with embeddings from an existing model to train new models on previously unseen data. This technique can be considered a form of data augmentation, as it involves using additional data (the embeddings from the existing model) to improve the performance of the new model.

In the context of bioacoustics and large-scale bird species classification, the paper by Gupta et al. (2021) compares recurrent convolutional neural networks (RCNNs) and other CNN architectures for audio classification. These networks can be trained on spectrogram images of bird sounds, which can be augmented using techniques such as time stretching, pitch shifting, and adding background noise to increase the amount and diversity of training data.

More generally, data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in computer vision tasks such as image recognition. These techniques involve creating modified versions of the original training data by applying transformations such as horizontal flipping, random rotations, and scaling. The intuition behind these techniques is that they can help the model generalize better to new, unseen data by providing it with a more diverse set of training examples.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling, these techniques are commonly used in deep learning pipelines, particularly in computer vision tasks. In the context of audio classification for bird species, data augmentation techniques such as time stretching, pitch shifting, and adding background noise can be used to increase the diversity of training data.
