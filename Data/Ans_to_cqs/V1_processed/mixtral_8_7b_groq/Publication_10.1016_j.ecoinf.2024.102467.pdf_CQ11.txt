The provided context does not give information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses a study that uses a deep learning model to detect benthic organisms in aquaculture. The study mentions that it is based on a network design that increases training speed and reduces the number of parameters, and uses the EfficientnetV2 network for feature extraction. However, there is no mention of where the data or code for this pipeline can be found. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to the data repository.
