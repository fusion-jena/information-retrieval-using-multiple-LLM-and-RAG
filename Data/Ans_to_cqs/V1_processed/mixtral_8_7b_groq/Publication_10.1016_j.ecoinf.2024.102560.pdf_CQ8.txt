The provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text focuses on the analysis of river runoff variation, precipitation datasets, land cover variations, and the use of satellite datasets for investigating water surface area and salinity variations. There is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a code repository in the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
