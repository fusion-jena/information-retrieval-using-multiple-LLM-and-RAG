Based on the provided context, there is no information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study titled "Extreme deep learning in biosecurity: the case of machine hearing for marine species identification" by Demertzis, Iliadis, and Anezakis. The text does not mention where the code can be found or if it is publicly available. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query. It is possible to reach out to the authors or look for related repositories in platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket, using keywords or searching for projects associated with the authors' names or the paper's title.
