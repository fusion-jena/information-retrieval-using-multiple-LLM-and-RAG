Based on the provided context, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the use of terms such as "classification network," "segmentation network," and "plant cover prediction network," which are all types of CNNs. Furthermore, the comparison with a ResNet50 model, a well-known CNN architecture, confirms the use of CNNs in the pipeline. The context does not mention any usage of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers.
