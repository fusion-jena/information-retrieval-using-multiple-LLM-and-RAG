Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps or Confusion matrix after model training. However, it does mention the calculation of Shape values as a postprocessing step.

Shape values are a measure of extrapolation degree used in the environmental space by calculating the distance between training and projection data. This is done by considering the Mahalanobis distance and using the FLEXSDM R package. The Shape extrapolation metric is obtained for both WorldClim and CHELSA, resulting in 12 surfaces, one for each month.

Additionally, the context provides a table comparing the performance of two models (PC 4 and PC 5) based on their explained variance. This could be inferred as a type of metrics calculation, as it evaluates the models' performance. However, this is not a direct postprocessing step after model training but rather an evaluation of the models' overall performance.

Therefore, the postprocessing steps mentioned in the provided context are:

1. Calculation of Shape values as a measure of extrapolation degree.
2. Evaluation of model performance based on explained variance.


The postprocessing steps mentioned in the provided context are the calculation of Shape values as a measure of extrapolation degree and the evaluation of model performance based on explained variance.
