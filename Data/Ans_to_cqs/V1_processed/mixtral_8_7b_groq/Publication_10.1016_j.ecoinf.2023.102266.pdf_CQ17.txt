The provided context does not directly discuss the regularization methods used in deep learning to prevent overfitting, such as dropout and L2 regularization. However, it does mention the application of machine learning and the use of techniques to improve the model's accuracy.

In the context of the given classification model, the authors mention modifying the update criterion to make it differentiable, which would allow for the application of machine learning tools. In the context of deep learning, this differentiable update criterion is often achieved through the use of gradient-based optimization algorithms.

Regularization methods, such as dropout and L2 regularization, are techniques used to prevent overfitting in deep learning models by adding a penalty term to the loss function. Dropout randomly sets a fraction of the neurons in a layer to zero during training, which helps to prevent co-adaptation of features and improves the model's generalization performance. L2 regularization adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the norm of the model's weights to the loss function, which encourages the model to learn smaller weights and reduces the risk of overfitting.

The authors also mention exploring innovative variance reduction techniques to improve the model's accuracy and broaden its applicability. While this is not directly related to regularization methods, variance reduction techniques can help to improve the model's performance by reducing the variance of the estimator.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss the regularization methods used in deep learning to prevent overfitting, it does mention the application of machine learning tools and the exploration of techniques to improve the model's accuracy. Regularization methods, such as dropout and L2 regularization, are important techniques used in deep learning to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization performance.
