Based on the information provided, the specific data repository for the deep learning pipeline was not mentioned. However, the text does provide a list of eight major repositories that were evaluated using F-UJI. These repositories include Figshare, Zenodo, Dryad, CSIRO, Ag Data Commons, KNB Data Repository, ZALF Open Research Data, and Agricultural and Environmental Data Archive (AEDA). Therefore, it is possible that the data repository for the deep learning pipeline is one of these eight. If the deep learning pipeline is a research study, then Figshare might be a good place to start, as it had the highest percentage of data study records. However, it is important to note that Figshare obtained low scores when the DOI of PLOS ONE was isolated from the remainder. On the other hand, both Zenodo and Dryad had high scores in terms of the FAIR principles. Ultimately, the choice of repository would depend on the specific needs and characteristics of the deep learning pipeline data.
