The provided context does not give specific information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It mentions that a deep learning-based pipeline is used for whitefly pest abundance estimation on chromotropic sticky traps, and that two models, Det-FRCNN and Det-FCOS, are used and their performance is evaluated based on MAE, GAME, and MARE metrics while changing the patch size and the threshold on the generated confidence score. However, it does not mention any specific method for hyperparameter optimization such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
