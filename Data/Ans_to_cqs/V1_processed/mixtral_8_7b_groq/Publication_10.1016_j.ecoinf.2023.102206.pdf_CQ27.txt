The text provided does not give specific details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model is a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on Wang, Y., et al., 2022. The model is used for early warning in sow oestrus sound monitoring.

From the context, we can infer that the model was likely serialized, which is a common practice in deep learning to save the trained model's architecture, weights, and biases. Serialization allows the model to be stored and later loaded into memory, so it doesn't have to be trained again. This is particularly useful when deploying a model in a production environment, where training the model from scratch would be time-consuming and computationally expensive.

As for the platform selection, the text does not provide specific details. However, it is mentioned that the proposed work utilizes acoustic data and deep CNN to identify oestrus and non-oestrus sounds of sows, which suggests that the model was deployed on a system capable of processing audio data. Additionally, the model is used for early warning systems on pig farms, indicating that the model was deployed in a real-world setting.

In summary, while the text does not provide specific details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, it is likely that the model was serialized for storage and later loaded into memory for use in a production environment. The model was deployed on a system capable of processing audio data and used for early warning systems on pig farms.
