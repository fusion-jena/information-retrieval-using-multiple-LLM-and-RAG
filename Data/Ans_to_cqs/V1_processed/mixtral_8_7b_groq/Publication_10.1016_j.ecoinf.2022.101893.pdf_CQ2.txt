The data format used in the deep learning pipeline described in the context is audio. This is because the pipeline is designed for bird audio data classification. The pipeline includes preprocessing the bird audio data to obtain processed data, extracting various features from the processed data such as WT spectrum, STFT spectrum, HHT spectrum, and MFCC features, and then using these features as input to a CNN pre-training model to generate deep features. These deep features are then used in conjunction with the original features to classify the bird audio data using RF, SVM, and MLP classifiers.
