Based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model is birdsong classification. The model utilizes neural network architectures such as VGG, Inception, and ResNet, which have been proposed for improved birdsong classification accuracy. For instance, Shazzadul utilized VGG16 to extract features from bird images, followed by classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM), achieving an accuracy of 89%.

The deep learning model's backbone network consists of four convolutional layers that extract features from images with a resolution of 256 × 256 × 3. These extracted features are then passed through two fully connected layers for further processing. Within the fully connected layers, the Sigmoid function is applied to one of them, facilitating the binary classification of true and false images. While the Softmax function is used in the other fully connected layer to predict the classification of the output results.

Moreover, the model uses spectral normalization and LeakyReLU activation functions in its convolutional layers. The output size of the model varies, with the final layer having an output size of (128*32*32,17), indicating that the model classifies birdsong into 17 different categories.

The model also uses dynamic convolution to improve the feature extraction capability of the network and solve the problem of overfitting caused by increasing the network's depth. Dynamic convolution uses a set of K parallel convolution kernels instead of a single convolution kernel per layer. These parallel convolutional kernels are dynamically aggregated by attention, which adjusts the weight of each convolution kernel according to the input, generating an adaptive dynamic convolution.

In summary, the deep learning model's purpose is birdsong classification, utilizing neural network architectures such as VGG, Inception, and ResNet, and dynamic convolution to improve feature extraction and classification accuracy.
