I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context mainly focuses on the methodology and application of a computer vision and deep learning-based framework for the automatic annotation of coral reefs. It explains how image representations extracted from deep neural networks, trained on large datasets such as ImageNet and fine-tuned on domain-specific datasets, have shown state-of-the-art performance in numerous image classification problems. The study uses the activation vectors of the first fully connected layer of a pre-trained VGGnet, with the weights Ô¨Åne tuned using the Benthoz15 dataset. However, it does not mention the data repository link for the deep learning pipeline.
