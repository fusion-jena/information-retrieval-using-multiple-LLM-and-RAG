Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model for remote sensing data in agriculture and environmental applications. However, it is widely acknowledged in the field of deep learning that preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning are crucial for improving model performance and convergence.

In the context of remote sensing data, normalization is often used to adjust the range of pixel values to a common scale, which can help reduce the effect of varying illumination conditions and sensor characteristics. Scaling, on the other hand, involves transforming the data to have zero mean and unit variance, which can further improve model convergence and generalization. Cleaning may also be necessary to remove noise, artifacts, or missing values from the data.

For example, in the study by Chen et al. (2014), the authors applied several preprocessing steps to hyperspectral data before training their deep learning model, including noise removal, band selection, and normalization. Similarly, in the study by Li et al. (2017), the authors applied data augmentation, normalization, and resampling to high-resolution remote sensing images before training their deep learning model for oil palm tree detection.

Therefore, while the specific preprocessing steps may vary depending on the nature of the data and the specific deep learning algorithm being used, it is likely that normalization, scaling, and cleaning are important preprocessing steps for training deep learning models on remote sensing data in agriculture and environmental applications.
