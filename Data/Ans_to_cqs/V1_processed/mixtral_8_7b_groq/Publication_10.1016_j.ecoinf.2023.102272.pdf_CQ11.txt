Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The articles and package documentation mention the use of various datasets for training and testing the deep learning models, but they do not specify where these datasets are stored or how they can be accessed.

However, the first article by Reichstein et al. (2019) states that "Data and code are available as supplementary material to the article" (<https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2020.101125>). This supplementary material may include the datasets used in the study, but it is not clear if they are publicly available or require permission to access.

The second article by Ripoche et al. (2019) also mentions that "Data are available from the authors upon request" (<https://doi.org/10.1093/jme/tjz002>). Therefore, it may be possible to obtain the dataset used in this study by contacting the authors directly.

The third article by Roiz et al. (2014) does not provide any information about data availability (<https://doi.org/10.1186/1756-3305-7-333>).

Finally, the R package documentation for deepnet (<https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=deepnet>) does not provide any information about data repositories or availability.

Therefore, while there may be some ways to access the datasets used in these studies, there is no clear or direct link to a public data repository provided in the context.
