The deep learning model for mapping burn scars in the Cerrado biome in Brazil was trained using Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and specialized hardware components for running parallel arithmetic operations. These resources were implemented on the Google Cloud suite of cloud Platform, specifically on the Google Cloud Virtual Machine environment. The use of GPUs and specialized hardware was necessary due to the powerful computational processing required by deep learning methods. The training of the model was carried out in a two-step process, including a training phase and a prediction phase. During the training phase, the learning rate, batch size, number of interactions, and inputs for classification were defined based on tests. The inputs for classification were the spectral data acquired from training samples of spectral bands defined based on the burned and non-burned areas. The Landsat-8 spectral bands used for the classification model of burned areas included red (RED - 0.65 μm), near-infrared (NIR - 0.86 μm), and shortwave infrared (SWIR 1 - 1.6 μm and SWIR 2 - 2.2 μm). Additionally, Landsat bands 2 to 7, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), NBR, and delta NBR (Difference Normalized Burned Index) were tested. The Landsat spectral bands were chosen because of their sensitivity to fire events. The training data was split into two, and the Google Earth Engine platform was used to collect the validation points and accuracy assessment of the burned areas products used in the analysis.
