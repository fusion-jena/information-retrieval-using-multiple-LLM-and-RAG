The provided context does not give specific information about the deep learning pipeline and the data formats used in it. However, it does mention the use of Sentinel-2 data in one of the studies. Sentinel-2 is an Earth observation mission from the European Space Agency (ESA) that provides high-resolution optical imagery. The data from Sentinel-2 is typically provided in a raster format (image), which can be used as input in a deep learning pipeline.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of other types of data in models, such as CSV files. CSV (Comma Separated Values) is a common data format used to store tabular data, such as numerical measurements or categorical variables.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that raster images (e.g., from Sentinel-2) and CSV files are two examples of data formats that could be used in a deep learning pipeline. However, the context does not provide enough information to determine if other data formats, such as audio or video, are used in the pipeline.
