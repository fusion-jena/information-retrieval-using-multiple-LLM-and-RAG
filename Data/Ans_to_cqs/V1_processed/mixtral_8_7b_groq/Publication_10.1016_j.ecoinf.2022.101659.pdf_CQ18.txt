Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The text discusses various topics related to the study of valve gaping in organisms and the potential benefits of collecting big data for predicting productivity and aiding aquaculture decision-making. It also mentions the use of R for data analysis and the creation of daily curves of gaping for input into the analysis.

However, it is common practice in machine learning and model training to monitor the performance of the model during training using techniques such as validation curves, learning curves, and cross-validation. These methods can help to assess how well the model is fitting the training data and how well it is expected to generalize to new, unseen data.

Therefore, while the specific strategy used in this study is not mentioned in the provided context, it is likely that some form of model performance monitoring was implemented during the training process.
