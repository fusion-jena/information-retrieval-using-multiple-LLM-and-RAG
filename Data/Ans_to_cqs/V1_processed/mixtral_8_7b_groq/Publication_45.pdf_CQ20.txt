The deep learning model in the context provided is trained using a desktop PC equipped with an Intel QuadCore CPU (Intel i5-6600) and an NVidia GTX 1070 GPU. This indicates that the model utilizes GPU resources for training.

The use of a GPU for training deep learning models is a common practice due to the computational intensity of the process. GPUs are well-suited for parallel processing, which is ideal for the matrix and vector operations that are fundamental to deep learning algorithms. Therefore, GPUs can significantly speed up the training process compared to CPUs.

It's important to note that the text does not mention the use of Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which are custom-built chips developed by Google specifically for machine learning tasks. TPUs are designed to accelerate tensor operations, which are the core operations in deep learning, even further. However, in this context, only a GPU is mentioned as the hardware resource used for training the deep learning model.
