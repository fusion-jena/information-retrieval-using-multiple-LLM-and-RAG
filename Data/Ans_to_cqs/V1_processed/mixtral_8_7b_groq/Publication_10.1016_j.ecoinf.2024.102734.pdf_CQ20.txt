The text does not provide explicit information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the computation time was evaluated using an Intel i7â€“9700 CPU with an NVIDIA RTX2070 GPU. This suggests that the model was likely trained and evaluated on a system with both a CPU and a GPU, specifically an NVIDIA RTX2070 GPU. It is common practice to use GPUs for training deep learning models due to their ability to perform parallel processing, which can significantly speed up the training process compared to using a CPU alone. Therefore, it can be inferred that a GPU, specifically an NVIDIA RTX2070, was used for training the deep learning model. However, the text does not provide information about whether other hardware resources, such as TPUs (Tensor Processing Units), were used.
