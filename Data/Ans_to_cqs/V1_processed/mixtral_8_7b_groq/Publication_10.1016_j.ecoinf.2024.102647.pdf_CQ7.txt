The provided context does not include information about deep learning models or the criteria used to split data for training such models. However, it does discuss the performance evaluation of machine learning models for predicting groundwater (GW) salinity hazard maps.

For the machine learning models, the performance was evaluated using four criteria: coefficient of determination (R2), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE), and correlation coefficient (COR). These criteria were applied to both training and testing datasets for Random Forest (RF) and Classification and Regression Trees (CART) models.

The training and testing datasets were also evaluated using statistical models, such as frequency ratio (FR) and statistical index (SI). These statistical models were used to estimate GW salinity hazard areas, which were then compared to the machine learning models' estimates.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly answer the query regarding deep learning model training data splitting criteria, it does discuss the evaluation of machine learning models' performance for predicting GW salinity hazard maps. The evaluation was based on four criteria, and both training and testing datasets were used for comparison.
