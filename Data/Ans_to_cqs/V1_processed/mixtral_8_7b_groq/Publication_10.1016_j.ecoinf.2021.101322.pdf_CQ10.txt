The deep learning pipeline for the CNN-based architecture used in the study mentioned in the provided context is implemented using the Keras and TensorFlow software packages in Python. The specific implementation of EfficientNet-B4 used in this study can be found in the code repository called "EfficientNet" on GitHub, available at <https://github.com/qubvel/efficientnet>. The pre-trained weights used for transfer learning are also available through this API.

The study used EfficientNet V1.1.0, which can be accessed at <https://github.com/qubvel/efficientnet/tree/master/efficientnet/v1.1>. The weights for EfficientNet-B4 can be downloaded from <https://github.com/qubvel/efficientnet/blob/master/efficientnet/weights.py>.

Therefore, the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study is <https://github.com/qubvel/efficientnet>.
