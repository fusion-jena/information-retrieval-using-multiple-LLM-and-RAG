The context provided does not specify which particular frameworks were used to build the deep learning models mentioned in the references. However, it is mentioned that deep learning models, in general, can be built using machine learning algorithms that are able to learn from a training dataset to make predictions on new examples.

Deep learning frameworks are software libraries that allow developers to build and train deep learning models. Some popular deep learning frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, Caffe, and Theano. TensorFlow and PyTorch are two of the most widely used frameworks in the research community and industry.

TensorFlow is an open-source library developed by Google Brain Team. It provides a comprehensive and flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML-powered applications. TensorFlow supports a wide array of neural network architectures and provides functionalities for distributed training, which is essential for training large-scale models.

PyTorch, on the other hand, is an open-source machine learning library based on the Torch library, developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. PyTorch provides tensor computation with strong GPU acceleration and deep neural networks built on a tape-based autograd system. PyTorch is known for its simplicity and ease of use, making it a popular choice for researchers and developers.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention which frameworks were used to build the deep learning models, it is highly likely that either TensorFlow or PyTorch, or both, were used, given their popularity and widespread use in the research community and industry.
