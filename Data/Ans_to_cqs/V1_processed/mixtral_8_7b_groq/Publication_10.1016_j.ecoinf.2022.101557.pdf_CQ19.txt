The context provided does not explicitly mention which specific deep learning framework, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, was used to build the model. However, it does mention the use of the Adam optimizer, which is compatible with both TensorFlow and PyTorch. It also mentions the use of dropout, a regularization technique, which is also compatible with both TensorFlow and PyTorch. Therefore, it can be concluded that the model was likely built using either TensorFlow or PyTorch, but the specific framework is not specified in the context.
