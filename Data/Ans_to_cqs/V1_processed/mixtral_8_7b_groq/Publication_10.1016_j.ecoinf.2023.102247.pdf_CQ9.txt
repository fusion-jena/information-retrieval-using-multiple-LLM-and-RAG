Based on the provided context, there is no information about a deep learning pipeline used in the study. The study employed an ensemble modeling approach in the BIOMOD2 package in R to predict the distribution of study species. Four different models, including one regression-based model and three machine-learning models (MaxEnt, RF, and SVM), were weight-averaged to generate a final ensembled model for each species. However, the context does not mention any deep learning pipeline used in the study. Therefore, I cannot provide information on the data repository for the deep learning pipeline.
