Based on the provided context, specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model for predicting water quality parameters using hyperspectral data are not explicitly mentioned. However, the authors have highlighted some important factors that should be considered for creating a representative dataset and developing a machine learning-based model with acceptable generalization.

Firstly, the number and spatial distribution of the samples play an essential role in ensuring the generalizability of the model. A diverse and representative dataset should be created by considering various factors like the spatial distribution of the samples, the number of samples, and the range of the target variable.

Secondly, the influence of different atmospheric correction algorithms should be noticed. The atmospheric correction algorithms like Vanhellemont and Ruddick (2021) can significantly impact the performance of the deep learning model. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate the performance of the model using different atmospheric correction algorithms.

Moreover, the authors have mentioned the use of artificial neural networks (ANN) and extreme machine learning algorithms for developing semi-empirical models. These algorithms provide intelligent ways of eliminating irrelevant spectral wavelengths while unraveling the complex relationship between response and predictor variables with limited assumptions and prior knowledge. These techniques can help improve the generalizability of the deep learning model.

Furthermore, the authors have highlighted the importance of cross-validation and stratified splitting for developing a machine learning-based model with acceptable generalization. Cross-validation is a powerful technique for evaluating the performance of the model and preventing overfitting. Stratified splitting ensures that the distribution of the target variable is similar in both training and testing datasets, which can help improve the generalizability of the model.

Therefore, while the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, the authors have highlighted some important factors that should be considered for creating a representative dataset and developing a machine learning-based model with acceptable generalization. These factors include the number and spatial distribution of the samples, the influence of different atmospheric correction algorithms, the use of intelligent techniques like ANN and extreme machine learning algorithms, and the use of cross-validation and stratified splitting.
