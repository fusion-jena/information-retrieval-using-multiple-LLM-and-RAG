The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in the study include estimated weight, estimated efficiency, and identified accuracy. 

The estimated weight of the fish is given in grams with a standard deviation (STD). The root mean square error (RMSE) is used to measure the difference between the estimated weight and the actual weight of the fish. The mean relative error (MRE) is also used to evaluate the performance of the model, which is the absolute difference between the estimated and actual weight divided by the actual weight. The R-squared (R2) value is used to determine the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable.

In the study, the deep learning model was compared with the YOLOv5n model for fish detection. The metrics used to compare the models include missing detection, bounding box deviation, and duplicate detection. Missing detection refers to the number of fish that were not detected by the model, while bounding box deviation measures the difference between the actual and predicted bounding box around the fish. Duplicate detection measures the number of fish that were detected more than once by the model.

The study also evaluates the performance of the deep learning model based on the fish body area as a parameter for weight estimation. The MRE for this method is 3.44%, indicating a high level of accuracy. However, the image processing work required for this method led to a decline in efficiency.

Overall, the study uses a combination of metrics to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model for fish detection and weight estimation. These metrics include estimated weight, RMSE, MRE, R2, missing detection, bounding box deviation, and duplicate detection. The study also considers the efficiency and complexity of the image processing methods used for weight estimation.
