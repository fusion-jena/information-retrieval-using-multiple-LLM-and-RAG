Based on the provided context, there is no information about the specific deep learning algorithms, models, or frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch that were used in the strategic planning reported in 1998. The context only mentions that the strategic planning was based on a deep learning algorithm, but it does not provide details about the implementation of this algorithm. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
