In the context of deep learning for smart farming, strategies to handle randomness in the pipeline can include setting a fixed random seed value. Deep learning models often involve stochastic processes, such as random weight initializations or random data shuffling, which can introduce variability in the training process. By setting a fixed seed value, researchers can ensure consistent and reproducible results across different runs of the same model.

For instance, in the study "Machine learning based fog computing assisted data-driven approach for early lameness detection in dairy cattle" (Taneja et al., 2020), the authors used a deep learning model for lameness detection in dairy cattle. Although the text does not explicitly mention the use of a fixed random seed value, it is a common practice in deep learning to set a fixed seed value to ensure reproducibility.

In addition to fixed seed values, other strategies to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines can include:

1. Cross-validation: This technique involves dividing the dataset into multiple folds, training the model on each fold, and averaging the results. This can help reduce the impact of randomness on the model's performance.
2. Data augmentation: This technique involves artificially increasing the size of the dataset by applying random transformations to the existing data. This can help improve the model's ability to generalize to new data and reduce overfitting.
3. Ensemble methods: These methods involve training multiple models and combining their predictions. This can help reduce the impact of randomness on the final prediction.

It is important to note that while these strategies can help handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, they may not be sufficient to address all sources of variability. Other factors, such as the quality and quantity of the data, the choice of model architecture, and the hyperparameter tuning process, can also impact the model's performance.

Therefore, when designing a deep learning pipeline for smart farming applications, it is essential to consider multiple strategies to handle randomness and ensure the robustness and reproducibility of the results.
