The provided context discusses the use of bounding box annotation in the deep learning pipeline for object detection. Specifically, it mentions the Intersection over Union (IoU) metric, which is used to determine the accuracy of the object detector by comparing the predicted bounding box with the ground-truth bounding box. A threshold of 0.3 is set for IoU to consider correct or incorrect detection results.

However, the context does not explicitly mention other data annotation techniques such as instance segmentation or semantic segmentation. Therefore, based on the given information, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.

Instance segmentation is a more fine-grained annotation technique than bounding box annotation, where each instance of an object is segmented and labeled in an image. This technique is useful for applications where the precise location and shape of the objects are important, such as in medical imaging or autonomous driving.

Semantic segmentation, on the other hand, involves labeling each pixel in an image according to the object class it belongs to. This technique is useful for applications where the overall context and scene understanding are important, such as in scene recognition or image synthesis.

In summary, while the provided context discusses the use of bounding box annotation and the IoU metric in the deep learning pipeline for object detection, it does not mention other data annotation techniques such as instance segmentation or semantic segmentation. Therefore, the answer to the query is that the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not specified in the given context.
