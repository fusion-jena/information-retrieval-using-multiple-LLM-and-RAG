Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix after the model training. The text focuses on the procedure used to build the models, including data preparation, scale optimization, subsampling of background points, and model evaluation.

However, it does mention the evaluation of component models using Area Under the Curve (AUC) and True Skill Statistic (TSS). These are performance metrics that can be calculated during the model evaluation process.

Additionally, the text mentions that they set aside one fold for external evaluation, suggesting that they might calculate the performance of the final model on this external evaluation dataset. This could involve calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or creating a confusion matrix.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention postprocessing steps like saliency maps, it does discuss the calculation of performance metrics such as AUC and TSS during model evaluation. Furthermore, it implies that additional metrics or a confusion matrix might be calculated during the external evaluation of the final model.
