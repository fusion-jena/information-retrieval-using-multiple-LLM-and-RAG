The provided context does not contain direct information about strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does contain information about the application of statistical and machine learning methods in ecological studies, which can provide some insight into the general use of randomness in data analysis.

In the study "Classification and regression with random forests as a standard method for presence-only data SDMs: a future conservation example using China tree species" by Zhang et al. (2019), the authors used random forests, a machine learning method that employs randomness to improve model performance. Random forests use a random subset of features to split nodes in decision trees, which helps to reduce overfitting and improve the generalization of the model. Additionally, the method uses a random seed value to initialize the algorithm, which ensures the reproducibility of the results.

In another study "Where should China practice forestry in a changing climate? A machine learning approach" by Zhang et al. (2022), the authors used a machine learning approach to identify suitable areas for forestry in China under a changing climate. While the study does not explicitly mention the use of randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it is likely that the authors employed similar strategies as those used in random forests to improve the model's performance.

In summary, while the provided context does not contain direct information about strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does suggest that the use of randomness in statistical and machine learning methods is a common practice in ecological studies. Specifically, the use of random subsets of features and random seed values can help to reduce overfitting and improve the generalization of the model. However, further investigation is needed to provide a more comprehensive answer to this query.
