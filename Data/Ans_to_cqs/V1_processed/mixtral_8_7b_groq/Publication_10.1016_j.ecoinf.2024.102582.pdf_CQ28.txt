The text provided does not explicitly mention the use of a deep learning model or the specific cloud platform it was deployed on. However, it does mention that the research was conducted using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform for image processing and analysis. The GEE platform is a cloud-based geoprocessing platform that provides access to large amounts of geospatial data and allows for rapid data access and parallel processing. It has been widely used for large-scale land cover dynamic monitoring research, including mangrove extraction in coastal zones, aquaculture ponds, marsh wetlands, and intertidal zones.

It is also mentioned that the GEE platform has a powerful background processing calculator associated with the Google cloud platform, which has been used to improve the accuracy of mangrove zonation monitoring and mapping. Additionally, GEE typically combines a large volume of data to avoid the biases of single-date image-based mapping.

So, it can be inferred that the research was conducted using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, which is built on the Google cloud platform. But it's not explicitly mentioned that a deep learning model was used or deployed on this platform.
