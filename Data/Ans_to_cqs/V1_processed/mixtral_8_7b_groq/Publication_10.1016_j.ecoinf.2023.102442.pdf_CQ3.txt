The provided pieces of context do not contain specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for mapping artisanal and small-scale mines. However, they do mention the use of satellite imagery and deep learning techniques for detecting and mapping mining activities.

In general, data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines for object detection and segmentation include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest in an image. The coordinates of these boxes are then used as labels to train deep learning models to detect and locate objects in new images.
2. Instance segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel of an object of interest in an image. This allows for more precise localization and identification of objects, especially when they overlap or are occluded.
3. Semantic segmentation: This technique involves labeling pixels in an image according to the object class they belong to. This is useful for identifying and quantifying the distribution of different types of objects or materials in an image.

In the context of mapping artisanal and small-scale mines, these techniques could be used to annotate satellite images with information about the location, size, and shape of mining sites. This annotated data could then be used to train deep learning models to automatically detect and map mining activities in new satellite images.

It is possible that the studies mentioned in the provided context used one or more of these data annotation techniques, but without more specific information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
