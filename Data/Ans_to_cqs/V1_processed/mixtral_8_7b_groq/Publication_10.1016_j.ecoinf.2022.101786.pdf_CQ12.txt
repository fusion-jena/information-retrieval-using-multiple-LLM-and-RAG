The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the context where it is mentioned that the model parameters were modified from the default configuration of Darknet, which is a CNN-based neural network framework. Additionally, the authors have referred to several works that discuss CNNs and their applications in image classification tasks. There is no mention of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers in the provided context, further confirming that a CNN model was used in this study.
