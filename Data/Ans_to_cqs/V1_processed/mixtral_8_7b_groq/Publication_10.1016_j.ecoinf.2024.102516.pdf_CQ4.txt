The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, as described in the given context, include only horizontal flipping. The text mentions that "we utilize horizontal flipping for data augmentation in this phase." There is no explicit mention of other techniques such as rotation, scaling, or random cropping. It's important to note that the choice of data augmentation techniques can depend on various factors, including the specific task, the nature of the data, and the architecture of the neural network. Therefore, while the current pipeline only includes horizontal flipping, other techniques might be employed in different contexts.
