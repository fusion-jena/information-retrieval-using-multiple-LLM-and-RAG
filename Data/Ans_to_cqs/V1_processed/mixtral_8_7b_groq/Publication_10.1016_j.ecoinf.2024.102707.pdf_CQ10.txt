I am unable to provide a direct link to the code repository of the deep learning pipeline as it was not included in the given context. However, the paper by Liu et al., 2020 mentions that they published the code used in the analysis, which suggests that it may be available in a code repository. It is possible that the code repository can be found in the same location as the data used in the study, which was published according to the 2024 paper.

Additionally, the paper by Le et al., 2022 also mentions that they published the trained machine learning model, so it is possible that the code used in their study is also available in a code repository.

I would recommend looking for the code repositories in the following locations:

* The Liu et al., 2020 paper: "Towards efficient machine learning methods for penguin counting"
* The Le et al., 2022 paper: "A convolutional neural network architecture designed for the automated survey of seabird colonies"
* The data repository for the 2024 paper: "To make these methods more accessible, we published the data used in this study, the code used in the analysis, and the trained machine learning model."

It is also possible that the code repositories are linked in the papers or in the data repository. If you are unable to find the code repositories, I would recommend reaching out to the authors of the papers for more information.
