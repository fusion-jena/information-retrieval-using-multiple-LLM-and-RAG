The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This information can be inferred from the context provided, which mentions that the DialectDecoder pipeline includes a step for training a CNN. Additionally, the CNN is specifically mentioned as being used for image classification, which is a common use case for CNNs. CNNs are particularly well-suited to image classification tasks because they are able to effectively analyze spatial information in images, such as the patterns and features present in spectrograms of bird songs. In the DialectDecoder pipeline, the CNN is trained on spectrograms of bird songs in order to classify the dialect of the bird. This is demonstrated by the example spectrograms provided in Figure 2, which show the different dialects of bird songs analyzed in the study. Overall, the use of a CNN in the DialectDecoder pipeline is a logical choice given the image classification task at hand and the effectiveness of CNNs in analyzing spatial information in images.
