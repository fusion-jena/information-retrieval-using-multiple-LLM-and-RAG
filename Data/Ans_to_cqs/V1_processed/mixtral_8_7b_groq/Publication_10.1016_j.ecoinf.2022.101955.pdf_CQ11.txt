Based on the provided context, there is no information about a deep learning pipeline or a specific data repository link for it. The context discusses various machine learning algorithms used for classifying and analyzing remote sensing data, such as k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Random Forest (RF), Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC), and Decision Trees (DT). However, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link associated with these algorithms.

The context does mention that supplementary data can be found online at <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2022.101955>, but this link leads to the article's supplementary data, not a deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I cannot provide the requested data repository link for the deep learning pipeline because it is not mentioned in the provided context.
