Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the use of standard deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet in the described studies. However, the context does mention the use of specific image sets in some studies.

For instance, one of the studies used an image set of karyotyping images of chromosomes (Sharma et al., 2017). Another study used sectioned brain microvasculature images (Med. Image Anal. 16 (6), 1241â€“1258). Additionally, some studies used images of the nematode-trapping fungus A. oligospora stained with SR2200 (Lopez-Molina et al., 2015; Shokouh et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2019).

Therefore, while the context does not provide information on the use of standard deep learning datasets, it does mention the use of specific image sets in some studies.
