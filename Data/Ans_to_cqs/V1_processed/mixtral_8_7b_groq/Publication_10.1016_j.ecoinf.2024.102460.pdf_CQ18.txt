Based on the provided context, there is no explicit description of a strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, there are some details about the evaluation of the models after training.

For instance, in the context of the LSTM model, the study compares its performance with that of the BP model and the Markov chain model. However, there is no mention of how the performance was monitored during the training of these models.

Similarly, in the context of the FMOP model, there is no mention of a strategy to monitor the model performance during training. The focus is more on the optimization results for land use demand in 2030, with tables showing the area, change amount, and change rate (%) for different land use types.

In the section about land type conversion drivers, a model called PLUS is used to analyze the drivers of expansion for six land types in the YRB-SX for the years 2000-2010 and 2010-2020. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the PLUS model's analysis is less than 0.2, indicating that the model performed well. However, this information pertains to the evaluation of the model after training, not during training.

In conclusion, while the text provides some details about the evaluation of models after training, there is no explicit description of a strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training.
