The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in the given context are based on observation times or frames. Specifically, the data is split into training, validation, and test sets based on the number of observation times or frames in each set.

For instance, in the case of 30 seconds or 120 frames of observation time, the data set is divided into 271,909 instances for training, 90,639 instances for validation, and 90,636 instances for testing. Similarly, for 60 seconds or 240 frames of observation time, the data set is divided into 267,301 instances for training, 89,103 instances for validation, and 89,100 instances for testing.

This splitting criteria is consistent across different observation times or frames, and the number of instances in each set is proportional to the observation time or frames. This approach ensures that the deep learning model is trained, validated, and tested on a diverse set of data, which helps to improve the model's generalization performance.

Furthermore, the use of a validation set in addition to a training set and a test set is a common practice in deep learning to prevent overfitting and to tune hyperparameters. The validation set is used during the training process to evaluate the model's performance and adjust the hyperparameters accordingly. Once the training is completed, the model's performance is evaluated on the test set, which was not employed during the training stage. This overall learning and testing procedure helps to assess the model's performance and its ability to predict water conditions accurately.
