Based on the provided context, there are strategies mentioned for handling data division in deep learning pipelines, which is one aspect of randomness. Specifically, the context mentions the use of a random selection process to divide a targeted fish species dataset into training and validation sets in an 8:2 ratio. This is described in the Zhang, Yang, Liu, Y., Liu, C., Zhao, R., Li, D., Shi, C., 2024 paper.

However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of random seed values to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. The random seed value is a mechanism used to ensure reproducibility in deep learning models by initializing the random number generator with a specific seed value, which in turn determines the sequence of random numbers generated during the training process.

In the context provided, the Zhang, C., Li, P., Sun, G., Guan, Y., Xiao, B., Cong, J., 2015 paper mentions optimizing FPGA-based accelerator design for deep convolutional neural networks, but it does not mention the use of random seed values. Similarly, the Wang, J.J., Hao, Z.Y., Li, H.L., 2019 paper discusses training memory access optimization for convolutional neural networks, but it does not mention the use of random seed values.

Therefore, while the context provides some information on handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline through data division, it does not explicitly mention the use of random seed values to handle randomness.
