Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, such as through methods like grid search or random search. The text focuses on the application of a LiDAR system and an improved KNN algorithm for individual mangrove tree segmentation, but it does not discuss the specifics of hyperparameter tuning. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question without making assumptions.
