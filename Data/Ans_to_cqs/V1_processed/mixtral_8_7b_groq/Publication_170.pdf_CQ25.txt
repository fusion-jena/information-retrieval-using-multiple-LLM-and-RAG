The deep learning model in the study is used for automatically filtering empty camera images in wildlife surveys. The model is based on the AlexNet architecture, which includes convolutional and fully connected layers with Local Response Normalization, Rectified Linear Unit activation function, and mean pooling for downsampling operations. The purpose of this model is to reduce time and personnel costs associated with manually classifying large numbers of camera trap images. The study found that the model can process 260 images per minute on a standard PC, which is faster than a previous model that processed 100 frames per minute on a 2.6 GHz CPU computer. The model's ability to automatically filter empty images can greatly save labor and time, and the percentage of savings is the same as the proportion of empty images. Therefore, the deep learning model in this study is used for image classification, specifically for identifying and filtering out empty images in wildlife camera trap datasets.
