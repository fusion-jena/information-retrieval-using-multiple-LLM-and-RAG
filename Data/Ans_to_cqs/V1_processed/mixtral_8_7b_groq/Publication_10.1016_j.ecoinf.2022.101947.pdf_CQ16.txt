Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The text mainly focuses on the validation of the dataset and the algorithm's performance concerning the test set size and the number of trails required for testing. However, it is common in machine learning and deep learning models to use a validation loss plateau or a similar metric to determine when training is complete. This approach helps to avoid overfitting and ensures that the model generalizes well to unseen data. Therefore, while the specific criteria are not mentioned in the context, it is still likely that some form of validation loss plateau or convergence metric was used to determine when training was complete.
