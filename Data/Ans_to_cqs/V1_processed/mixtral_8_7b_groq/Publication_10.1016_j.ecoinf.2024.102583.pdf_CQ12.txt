The provided context discusses the use of machine learning models in landslide susceptibility modeling (LSM), with a focus on the XGBoost model. However, it does not explicitly mention the use of any deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) or Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN) in the research pipeline. These models are only mentioned as potential models for future investigation.

The context does mention that the research plans to compare the performance of ensemble techniques with deep learning models such as CNN and RCNN, but it does not specify whether these models have been implemented or not.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to definitively answer that a specific type of deep learning model such as CNN or RCNN is used in the pipeline.
