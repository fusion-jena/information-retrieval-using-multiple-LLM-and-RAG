The provided context does not explicitly state the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It only mentions that TensorFlow, an open-source software platform for deep learning research and applications, was used to develop and adapt the model for the project. The model was configured via Python, and the training steps and validation percentage parameters were adjusted. However, there is no information about the deployment platform, whether it be AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or another alternative. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
