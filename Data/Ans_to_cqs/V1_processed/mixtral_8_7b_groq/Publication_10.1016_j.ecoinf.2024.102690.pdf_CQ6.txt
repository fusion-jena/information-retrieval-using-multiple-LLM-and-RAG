The provided context discusses the use of the Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM) neural network approach for identifying ecological sources, but it does not directly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

However, it can be inferred that some data preprocessing steps were taken into account before applying the SOFM algorithm. For instance, the Ecological Service Value (ESV) was reconstructed, which suggests that the ESV data underwent some processing to make it suitable for the analysis.

Moreover, the hotspot analysis conducted using the Getis-Ord G*i statistic implies that the ESV data was subjected to spatial analysis techniques, which may include data normalization or scaling to ensure comparability across different spatial units.

Therefore, it can be said that data preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning are essential in deep learning models, including the SOFM algorithm, to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results. These steps help to ensure that the data is in a suitable format for the model, reduce noise and outliers, and enhance the model's ability to learn and generalize from the data.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, it can be inferred that such steps were taken into account before applying the SOFM algorithm. Data preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning are crucial in deep learning models to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results.
