Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. It is possible that the authors have not made it publicly available, or it may be hosted on a platform other than GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
