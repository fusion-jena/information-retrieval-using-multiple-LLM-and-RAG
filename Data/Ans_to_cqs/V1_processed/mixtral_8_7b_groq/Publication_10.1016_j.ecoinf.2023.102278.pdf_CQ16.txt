The criteria used to determine when training is complete in the context provided is the point at which the validation loss starts to increase, indicating overfitting. This is observed after nine epochs in the best model with transfer learning. Overfitting occurs when the model starts to learn the training data too well, to the point where it performs poorly on unseen data, as indicated by an increasing validation loss. The validation loss is the loss evaluated on the validation dataset, which is separate from the training dataset.

It is important to note that the variation in accuracy due to changes in the value of alpha (Î±) was minimal, with a largest variation of 0.6%, which is similar to the variation of 0.8% observed in Figure B.4. This suggests that the choice of alpha has a limited impact on the accuracy of the model.

Additionally, the best-performing ResNet50MTL model was later used to evaluate the hierarchical classification on the validation (TLm) and testing (TLt) dataset. The ResNet50MTL model achieved high precision, recall, and F1-score for the L1, L2, and L3 levels, as shown in Table 4.

In summary, the criteria used to determine when training is complete is the point at which the validation loss starts to increase, indicating overfitting. This was observed after nine epochs in the best model with transfer learning. The variation in accuracy due to changes in the value of alpha was minimal, and the best-performing ResNet50MTL model achieved high precision, recall, and F1-score for the L1, L2, and L3 levels.
