The performance of the deep learning model for classifying fish maturity stages was evaluated using several metrics, including Cohen's kappa coefficient (κ), precision, sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence.

Cohen's kappa coefficient (κ) is a measure of the proportion of agreements between the predicted and actual values, taking into account the possibility of the agreement occurring by chance. It is calculated using the formula: 

κ = 2 × (TP × TN) / [(TP + FP) × (FP + TN) + (TP + FN) × (FN + TN)]

Where TP is the number of true positives, TN is the number of true negatives, FP is the number of false positives, and FN is the number of false negatives.

Precision, also known as positive predictive value, is the proportion of correct positive predictions out of all positive predictions. It is calculated as:

Precision = TP / (TP + FP)

Sensitivity, also known as recall, is the true positive rate or the proportion of actual positives that were correctly identified. It is calculated as:

Sensitivity = TP / (TP + FN)

Specificity is the true negative rate or the proportion of actual negatives that were correctly identified. It is calculated as:

Specificity = TN / (TN + FP)

Prevalence is the proportion of actual positives in the data. It is calculated as:

Prevalence = (TP + FN) / (TP + FN + FP + TN)

These metrics were used to evaluate the model's performance on each sampled fish, and the results were summarized in Table 2. The table shows the sensitivity, specificity, prevalence, and error for each maturity stage and for both survey and commercial fishing data. The error is the percentage of misclassified samples, and the target is to have an error lower than 11%.

In addition, the table shows that the model has high sensitivity (higher than 86%) and high specificity (higher than 85%) for all maturity stages, indicating that the model is able to accurately classify the maturity stages. The prevalence is also high (more than 43%) for some stages, indicating that these stages are more common in the data.

In summary, the model's performance was evaluated using Cohen's kappa coefficient, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence. These metrics were used to assess the model's ability to accurately classify the maturity stages of fish, and the results showed that the model has high sensitivity, high specificity, and low error, indicating that it is a reliable tool for classifying fish maturity stages.
