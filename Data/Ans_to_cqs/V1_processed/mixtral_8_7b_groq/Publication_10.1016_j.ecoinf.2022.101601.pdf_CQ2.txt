The provided context does not give specific information about the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses various parameters and variables related to permafrost thaw depth.

In general, deep learning pipelines can handle various data formats, including images, audio, video, CSV files, and more. The choice of data format depends on the specific problem and the type of data available. For instance, image data is often used for computer vision tasks, while time-series data in CSV format might be used for natural language processing or signal analysis.

In the context of permafrost thaw depth, one might use raster or vector geospatial data formats (e.g., GeoTIFF, Shapefile) to represent spatial variables such as soil density, vegetation height, or solar radiation. Time-series data in CSV format could be used to represent temperature measurements or other temporal variables. Additionally, structured data formats like JSON or XML might be used to store metadata, model configurations, or other relevant information.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly answer the query, deep learning pipelines can handle various data formats, such as images, audio, video, CSV files, and others. The appropriate data format depends on the specific problem and the type of data available.
