The provided context does not specify the particular datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and a dynamic Î²-VAE in an unsupervised and semi-supervised learning scenario. However, it does not mention or identify the datasets utilized in the process. Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot provide the names of the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
