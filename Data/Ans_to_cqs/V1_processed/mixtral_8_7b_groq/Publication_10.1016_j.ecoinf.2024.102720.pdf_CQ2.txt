The provided context does not include specific details about the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of a deep learning algorithm for strategic planning (Report 1998) and a study that used a deep learning model for analyzing ecosystem service value and changes in food supply and demand (Ren et al., 2023).

Deep learning models can handle various data formats, including but not limited to images, audio, video, and CSV files. The choice of data format depends on the specific problem being addressed and the type of data available.

For instance, in computer vision tasks, deep learning models often use images as input, which are typically represented as multi-dimensional arrays. In natural language processing, text data is often converted into numerical representations, such as word embeddings or sequences of one-hot encoded vectors, which can be used as input to deep learning models. In audio and speech processing, time-series data is used, which can be represented as spectrograms or raw waveform data. In video processing, both spatial and temporal data are used, which can be represented as sequences of frames or optical flow data.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipelines, it is safe to say that deep learning models can handle various data formats, and the choice of format depends on the specific problem and data available.
