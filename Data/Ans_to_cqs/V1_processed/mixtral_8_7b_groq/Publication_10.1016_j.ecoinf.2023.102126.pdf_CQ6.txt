The provided context does not directly discuss the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention the FAIR principles, which are a set of guidelines for making data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. These principles can be applied to data preprocessing, but the context does not go into detail about this.

In the context of deep learning, there are several common preprocessing steps that are used to prepare data for training. These include:

1. Normalization: This involves scaling numeric data to a common range, such as 0 to 1. This can help improve the performance of deep learning algorithms by making it easier for them to learn the relationships between different features.
2. Scaling: Similar to normalization, scaling involves transforming data to a common range. However, scaling does not necessarily preserve the original distribution of the data.
3. Cleaning: This involves removing or correcting errors, inconsistencies, and missing values in the data. This is an important step because deep learning algorithms are sensitive to the quality of the data they are trained on.
4. Feature engineering: This involves creating new features from the existing data, such as by combining multiple features into a single feature or extracting features from raw data using techniques like principal component analysis (PCA).

It's important to note that the specific preprocessing steps required will depend on the characteristics of the data and the deep learning algorithm being used. In some cases, additional preprocessing steps may be required, such as dimensionality reduction or data augmentation.
