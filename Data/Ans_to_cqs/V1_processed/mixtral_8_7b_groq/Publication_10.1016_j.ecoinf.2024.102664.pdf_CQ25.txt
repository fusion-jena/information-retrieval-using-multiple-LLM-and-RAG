The deep learning models in the study are used for regression output, specifically for forecasting algal blooms in the Zhoushan fishery. The models used include Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and a hybrid CNN-LSTM model. These models are trained to predict chlorophyll concentration, which is an indicator of algal blooms, using satellite data.

The CNN model is known for its robust capabilities in image feature extraction and has been used in time series signal processing. The CNN network architecture comprises convolutional and pooling layers, which are responsible for realizing the core functions of CNN. In this study, the CNN model has a convolutional layer with a kernel size of 2 × 2 × 25, followed by a maximum pooling layer with a kernel size of 2 × 2. The model has two fully connected layers, and the number of nodes in the first fully connected layer is 10, and in the second fully connected layer is 1.

The LSTM model is a type of recurrent neural network that is capable of learning long-term dependencies and is suitable for time series data. The LSTM model in this study includes a sequence input layer, an LSTM layer with 60 nodes, two fully connected layers, and a regression output layer. The number of nodes in the first fully connected layer is 10, and in the second fully connected layer is 1.

The hybrid CNN-LSTM model combines the strengths of both CNN and LSTM models. The CNN model extracts image features, and the LSTM model learns the temporal dependencies of the extracted features. The hybrid model includes a convolutional layer, a maximum pooling layer, an LSTM layer, and two fully connected layers.

The purpose of these deep learning models is to forecast algal blooms by predicting chlorophyll concentration. The models are trained using satellite data and the adjustment process of the solver for training the network and input time series length is optimized for each model. The performance of the models is evaluated based on Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) with a 10 μg/L threshold. The results show that the hybrid CNN-LSTM model has the lowest RMSE, indicating that it is the best model for forecasting algal blooms in the Zhoushan fishery.
