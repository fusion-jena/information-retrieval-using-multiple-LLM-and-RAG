Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling being applied in the described deep learning pipeline. The pipeline consists of three main steps: (a) running a pre-trained detector model on images, (b) embedding the obtained crops into a lower-dimensional space, and (c) running an active learning procedure. However, the text does not mention any data augmentation techniques being used within these steps.

In general, data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in deep learning to increase the diversity of the training data and improve the model's ability to generalize. These techniques work by creating modified versions of the existing training samples, such as horizontally flipping an image, rotating it by a certain angle, or scaling it up or down. By incorporating these variations into the training set, the model can learn to be more invariant to such transformations, which can help improve its performance on unseen data.

While the described pipeline does not explicitly mention data augmentation, it is possible that such techniques were employed as part of the pre-trained detector model used in step (a). It is common practice to apply data augmentation during the training of object detection models, as it can help improve their performance. However, without further information about the specific pre-trained detector model used in the pipeline, it is not possible to confirm whether data augmentation was indeed used in this case.
