I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline for butterfly classification using the AlexNet architecture. The context focuses on the feasibility of using a small dataset to train deep learning models and the specifics of the experiments performed for butterfly classification. Therefore, I am unable to provide the code repository link based on the given information.
