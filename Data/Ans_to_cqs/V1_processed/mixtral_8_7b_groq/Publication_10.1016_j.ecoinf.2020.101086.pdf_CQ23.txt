The provided context discusses a study related to species distribution models (SDMs) and methods to correct for sampling bias in the data used to build these models. However, the context does not directly mention the use of measures such as a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model.

In the context, the authors discuss the use of four approaches to transform the model input data in order to modify the distribution of the presence sites and create a balanced dataset. These approaches can be categorized based on two criteria: the dataset concerned with the transformation (presence sites or background sites), and the implementation spaces of the transformation (geographical or environmental feature space). This method aims to create a more unbiased model by transforming the presence dataset to a more uniform distribution and building the background set via a uniform random selection.

Additionally, the authors mention that the number of presence sites used to build the SDM is often limited due to the scarcity of the species or an inadequate number of species records. To address this, the authors suggest the need for many presence sites for the transformation method to be effective.

In summary, the context discusses methods for creating a more unbiased SDM by transforming the model input data, but it does not directly mention the use of measures such as a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model.
