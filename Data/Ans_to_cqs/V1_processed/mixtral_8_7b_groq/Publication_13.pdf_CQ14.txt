The text does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It does not mention any specific techniques such as grid search, random search, or others. The optimization of the model's hyperparameters is implied through the description of the adversarial training procedure, but the specific method of hyperparameter tuning is not specified. Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to give a definitive answer to this question.
