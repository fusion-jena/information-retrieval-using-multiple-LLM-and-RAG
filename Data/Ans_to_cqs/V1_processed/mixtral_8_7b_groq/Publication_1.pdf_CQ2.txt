The deep learning pipeline for processing and analyzing large, high-bit-rate datasets primarily uses image and audio data formats. For audio data, 16-bit stereo audio at a sample rate of 22,000 samples per second (22 kHz) is typically used for recording bird vocalizations. For image data, 2048-by-1536 8-bit 4:2:2 color images are used for tracking populations of invasive snakes, captured at least once every thirty seconds at each site. These data formats are used to classify the presence or absence and activity rates of various endangered species or specific event types, such as the sounds of birds colliding with energy infrastructure.

While the text does not explicitly mention video or CSV data formats, it does not rule out their usage either. Considering the broad field of deep learning and its applications, video and CSV data formats can be used in other projects or contexts. Video data, for instance, can be useful for analyzing animal behavior or movement patterns. CSV data formats can be used for tabular data, such as environmental sensor data like temperature or air quality, which, although utilizing much lower data rates, can still contribute valuable information to a deep learning pipeline.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline primarily uses image and audio data formats, such as 16-bit stereo audio and 2048-by-1536 8-bit 4:2:2 color images. However, video and CSV data formats can also be part of deep learning pipelines, depending on the specific application and data requirements.
