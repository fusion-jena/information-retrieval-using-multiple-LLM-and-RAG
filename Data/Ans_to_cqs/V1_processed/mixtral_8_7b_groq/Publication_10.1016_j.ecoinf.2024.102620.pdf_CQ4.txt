Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling being applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data was resampled from its original spatial resolution of 1.875 to 500m. Resampling is a form of data augmentation that involves changing the resolution or size of the input data, but it is not one of the common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines for image data.

The common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines for image data include flipping, rotating, scaling, and cropping. Flipping involves horizontally or vertically flipping the image, rotating involves rotating the image by a certain angle, scaling involves changing the size of the image, and cropping involves removing some parts of the image. These techniques are used to increase the size of the training dataset, improve the model's ability to generalize, and reduce overfitting.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
