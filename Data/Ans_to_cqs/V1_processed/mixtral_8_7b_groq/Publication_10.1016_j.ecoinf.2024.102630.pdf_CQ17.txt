The provided context does not contain information about regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. Instead, it discusses the use of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) products in remote sensing and land cover classification research.

NDVI products can have different strengths and weaknesses depending on their cloud cover and surface information. Researchers must carefully select NDVI products based on data suitability for their specific research needs (Fensholt et al., 2009). Various mean NDVI data types, such as annual, growing season, spring, summer, and winter, can be used for land cover classification (Kong et al., 2016).

Two studies mentioned in the context, Jin et al. (2009) and Li et al. (2020), focus on cloud characteristics and vegetation coverage response to climatic factors, respectively, but neither discusses deep learning regularization methods.

In summary, while the provided context offers valuable insights into NDVI products and their applications in remote sensing and land cover classification research, it does not address the query regarding regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines.
