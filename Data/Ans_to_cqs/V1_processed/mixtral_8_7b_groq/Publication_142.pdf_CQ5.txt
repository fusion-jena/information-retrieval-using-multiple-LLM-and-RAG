The deep learning pipeline used in the study mentioned in the context utilizes the ImageNet dataset for training the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The CNN model is initially pre-trained on ImageNet, a large-scale image recognition dataset comprising over 14 million images and 1000 object classes. After pre-training, the model is fine-tuned on Pl@ntNet data, a dataset specific to plant species identification, which covers 30,261 species and has 2.9 million images.

The ImageNet dataset is commonly used for training CNN models in various computer vision tasks due to its extensive collection of images and diverse object classes. It has been instrumental in advancing deep learning research and has been used as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of CNN models.

In contrast, the Pl@ntNet dataset is specialized for plant species identification and is used to fine-tune the pre-trained CNN model. Fine-tuning the model on this dataset enables it to adapt to the specific task of plant species identification and improve its performance on this task.

Therefore, the deep learning pipeline in this study uses the ImageNet dataset for pre-training and the Pl@ntNet dataset for fine-tuning the CNN model.
