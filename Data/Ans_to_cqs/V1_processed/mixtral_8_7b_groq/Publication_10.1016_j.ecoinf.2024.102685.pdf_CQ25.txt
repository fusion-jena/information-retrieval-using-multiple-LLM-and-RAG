Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of a deep learning model being used in the study. Instead, the study primarily focuses on the use of a Random Forest (RF) classification model for mapping seagrass habitats using multispectral images.

The RF model is used for the classification task, where the response variable is the presence or absence of seagrass meadows. The model is trained using a bootstrapped sample of the training data, and at each split node, a subset of randomly selected features is utilized. The final classification for each pixel is obtained by a majority vote.

Therefore, the purpose of the model used in the study is for classification, specifically for classifying pixels in multispectral images as either seagrass meadows or non-seagrass meadows.
