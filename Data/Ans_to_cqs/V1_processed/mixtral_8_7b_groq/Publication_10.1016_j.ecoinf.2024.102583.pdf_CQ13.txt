The provided context discusses various machine learning models used in Landslide Susceptibility Mapping (LSM), including XGBoost, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). However, it does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN).

However, based on general knowledge of deep learning models, some common hyperparameters for CNN and RCNN include:

1. Learning rate: This controls the step size during gradient descent. A learning rate that is too small may result in slow convergence, while a learning rate that is too large may cause overshooting and poor convergence.

2. Optimizer: This is the algorithm used to update the model's weights based on the gradient of the loss function. Common optimizers include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop.

3. Number of epochs: This is the number of times the learning algorithm will work through the entire training dataset.

4. Batch size: This is the number of samples that will be used in one iteration of gradient descent.

5. Number of filters: In CNN, this refers to the number of convolutional kernels used to extract features from the input data.

6. Kernel size: In CNN, this refers to the size of the convolutional kernel.

7. Pooling size: In CNN, this refers to the size of the pooling operation, which reduces the spatial size of the convolved feature.

8. Number of hidden layers: This refers to the number of layers between the input and output layers in the neural network.

9. Number of neurons in each hidden layer: This refers to the number of artificial neurons in each hidden layer.

10. Activation function: This is the function applied to the neuron's output to introduce non-linearity into the model. Common activation functions include ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in deep learning models for LSM, these are some common hyperparameters that could be tuned for CNN and RCNN models.
