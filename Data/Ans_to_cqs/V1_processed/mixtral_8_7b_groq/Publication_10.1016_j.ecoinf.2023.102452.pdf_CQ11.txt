The provided context does not include information about a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. There are several studies mentioned in the context, but none of them provide a link to a data repository for their deep learning pipelines.

The first study by Dehghani et al. (2023) compares LSTM, CNN, and ConvLSTM for hourly short-term streamflow forecasting using deep learning approaches, but there is no mention of a data repository link.

The second study by Eureqa (2009) introduces a software for symbolic regression, but it does not provide a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link.

The third study by Everaert et al. (2013) discusses the development and assessment of ecological models in the context of the European water framework directive, but it does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link.

The fourth study by Feng et al. (2017) proposes a data-driven multi-model methodology with deep feature selection for short-term wind forecasting, but it does not provide a data repository link.

Therefore, I cannot provide a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
