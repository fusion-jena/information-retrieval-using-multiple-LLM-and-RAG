The context provided does not give specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the paper is about the recognition of endemic bird species using deep learning models. Therefore, it can be inferred that the raw data for this study was likely collected using methods such as bird surveys, birdwatching, and bird banding to gather observations or images of the endemic bird species. Additionally, public datasets of bird images may have also been used. Sensors such as audio recorders or camera traps could have been used as well, although this is not explicitly stated in the context.

In general, for a deep learning pipeline, raw data can be collected using a variety of methods, including but not limited to:

* Surveys: structured or unstructured questions used to gather information from human respondents.
* Sensors: devices that measure physical quantities and convert them into signals that can be read by humans or machines. Examples include cameras, audio recorders, and temperature sensors.
* Public datasets: datasets that are made available by organizations or individuals for use by the public. These can be found in repositories such as UCI Machine Learning Repository, Kaggle, and Google Dataset Search.
* Scraping: automatically collecting data from websites using web scraping tools or scripts.
* Experiments: controlled studies designed to gather specific data.

It is important to note that the method of data collection will depend on the specific task and the type of data needed. For example, if the task is image recognition, then image datasets would be needed, and they could be collected through cameras or public datasets. If the task is natural language processing, then text data would be needed, and it could be collected through surveys, scraping, or public datasets.
