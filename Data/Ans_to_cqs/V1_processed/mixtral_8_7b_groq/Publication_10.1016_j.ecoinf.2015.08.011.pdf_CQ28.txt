Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the specific platform that was used to deploy the deep learning model. The context focuses on the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) in various fields such as bioinformatics, ecology, and environmental engineering. It also describes the process of determining the optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer and the optimal learning rate for the ANN model. However, it does not mention any details about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
