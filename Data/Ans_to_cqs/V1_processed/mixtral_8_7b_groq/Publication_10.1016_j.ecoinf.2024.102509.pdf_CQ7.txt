In the context provided, there are no specific criteria mentioned for splitting the data into train, test, and validation sets for deep learning model training. However, it is generally recommended to split the data into three subsets: training set, validation set, and test set. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune the model's hyperparameters and select the best model, and the test set is used to evaluate the final model's performance.

In general, the data split ratio can vary depending on the size of the dataset and the specific problem at hand. A common split ratio is 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. However, in some cases, a 80%-10%-10% or 60%-20%-20% split may be more appropriate. It is important to ensure that the data is split randomly to avoid any biases in the training, validation, and test sets.

In the context provided, it is mentioned that the quality and quantity of the sample dataset are important for the accuracy of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model's training process. Therefore, it is crucial to have a sufficient amount of high-quality data for training the model. Additionally, repeated training and testing are necessary to develop an optimal neural network and attain high accuracy.

Moreover, the optimal numbers of hidden layers of an ANN model depend on the problem itself, and the over-fitting problem can occur at any instance. To prevent overfitting, techniques such as regularization, dropout, and early stopping can be used. These techniques can be applied during the training phase and can help improve the model's generalization performance.

In summary, while the context provided does not mention specific criteria for splitting the data into train, test, and validation sets, it is generally recommended to use a random split of the data into these three subsets. The quality and quantity of the data, as well as techniques to prevent overfitting, are important considerations for training deep learning models.
