The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the references to various studies that have used CNN for insect detection and classification. For instance, Wang et al. (2020b) used a deep convolutional neural network for common pests image recognition. Similarly, Wang et al. (2017) used a deep convolutional neural network for crop pests image classification. Furthermore, the YOLOv5 model used in the pipeline is also a CNN-based model. It is a variant of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model, which is known for its real-time object detection capabilities. YOLOv5 uses a CNN backbone for feature extraction and a path aggregation network for information flow. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network.
