Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the generalizability measures taken for a deep learning model. The models mentioned in the context are SRE, CTA, ANN, Maxent, GLM, and GBM, but none of them is a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide specific details about the generalizability measures taken for a deep learning model in this particular study.

However, I can provide some general measures that are commonly used to ensure the generalizability of deep learning models:

1. Diverse dataset: A diverse and representative dataset is crucial for deep learning models to generalize well. The dataset should cover various scenarios, edge cases, and data distributions to ensure that the model can handle unseen data during deployment.

2. Cross-validation: Cross-validation is a technique used to assess the performance and generalizability of a model by dividing the dataset into multiple folds. The model is trained on one fold and tested on another, repeating the process for all folds. This way, the model's performance is evaluated on different subsets of the data, reducing the risk of overfitting.

3. Stratified splitting: Stratified splitting is a method used to ensure that the train and test datasets have a similar distribution of classes or labels. This is particularly important in imbalanced datasets, where one class may have significantly more instances than another. Stratified splitting ensures that the model is exposed to a balanced representation of classes during training, improving its ability to generalize.

4. Regularization: Regularization techniques, such as L1, L2, or dropout, are used to prevent overfitting in deep learning models. Regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, discouraging the model from learning overly complex patterns that may not generalize well.

5. Early stopping: Early stopping is a technique used to halt the training process before the model starts overfitting. It monitors the model's performance on a validation set during training and stops training when the performance starts degrading.

Without specific information from the context, I cannot confirm whether these measures were applied in this study. Nonetheless, these are general best practices for ensuring the generalizability of deep learning models.
