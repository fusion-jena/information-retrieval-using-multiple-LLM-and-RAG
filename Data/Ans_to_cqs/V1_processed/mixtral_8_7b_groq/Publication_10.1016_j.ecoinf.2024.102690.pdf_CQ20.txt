Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The text focuses on the use of the Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM) neural network approach for identifying ecological sources and establishing ecosystem service (ES) bundles. It explains the methodology of using the SOFM algorithm and other analytical tools such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), hotspot analysis, and the Davis-Boldin Index (DBI) for this purpose.

However, the text does not mention any details about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. Hardware resources like Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) are often used for training deep learning models due to their ability to perform parallel processing, which significantly speeds up the training process. But, since this information is not provided in the context, it is not possible to give a definitive answer.
