The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model mentioned in the context include the learning rate and the optimizer. Specifically, the optimizer used is Adam, which is a popular choice for optimizing deep learning models due to its efficiency and ability to adapt to the learning process. However, the learning rate is not explicitly mentioned in the context.

In general, the learning rate is an important hyperparameter that determines the step size at each iteration of the optimization process. It controls how much the model's weights are updated during training, and choosing an appropriate learning rate is crucial for the model's convergence and performance.

Other hyperparameters that are not explicitly mentioned in the context but are commonly used in deep learning models include the number of hidden layers, the number of neurons in each layer, the activation function, the batch size, and the number of epochs.

The number of hidden layers and the number of neurons in each layer determine the complexity of the model and its capacity to learn the underlying patterns in the data. The activation function, such as the sigmoid function mentioned in the context, introduces non-linearity into the model and enables it to learn more complex relationships.

The batch size determines the number of samples that are processed at once during training, and the number of epochs determines the number of times the entire training dataset is processed. These hyperparameters can affect the model's training time, convergence, and generalization performance.

Overall, the choice of hyperparameters can significantly impact the performance of deep learning models, and tuning these hyperparameters is an important aspect of deep learning model development. However, the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model mentioned in the context are not fully specified in the given text.
