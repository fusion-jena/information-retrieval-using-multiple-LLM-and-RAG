The provided context does not give information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The text describes an Open Science workflow that combines vessel tracking data from satellite and AIS systems with global, high-quality, environmental, biodiversity, and fishery data. The workflow includes a process for estimating fishing pressure on stocks and other species, which involves associating information on stocks, species variety, and threatening status to the fishing hours of each cell in a studied area. The algorithm for this process is provided, but there is no mention of where the code repository for the deep learning pipeline can be found.
