The provided context does not give specific details about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It mentions the use of MaxEnt for species distribution modeling, but it does not specify the method used for hyperparameter tuning. Hyperparameter tuning is an important step in machine learning models to ensure that the model is performing optimally. Common methods for hyperparameter tuning include grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization. Grid search involves testing all possible combinations of hyperparameters within a specified range, while random search selects a subset of hyperparameters to test at random. Bayesian optimization uses Bayesian inference to select the next set of hyperparameters to test based on the performance of previous tests. Without more information, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to how the hyperparameters were optimized in this case.
