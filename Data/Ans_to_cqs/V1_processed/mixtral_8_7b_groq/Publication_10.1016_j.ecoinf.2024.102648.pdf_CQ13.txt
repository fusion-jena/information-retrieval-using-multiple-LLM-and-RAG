The provided context discusses the use of a deep learning model, specifically an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in the form of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), to predict the percent incidence of Cotton Leaf Curl Disease (CLCuD) in upland cotton. However, the specific hyperparameters used in the MLP model are not provided in the context.

Hyperparameters are configuration variables that are set before the learning process begins. They determine the structure of the neural network, such as the number of layers and nodes, as well as the learning process, such as the learning rate, the number of iterations, and the type of optimizer.

In the context, it is mentioned that the training accuracy of the MLP model is 0.80, and an R-squared value is reported, but the specific hyperparameters used to achieve this performance are not provided.

Therefore, based on the information given, it is not possible to answer this question without additional information.
