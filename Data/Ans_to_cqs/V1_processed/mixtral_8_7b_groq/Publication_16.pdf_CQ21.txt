Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about post-processing steps taken immediately after model training such as generating saliency maps or creating a confusion matrix. However, it is mentioned that performance metrics were calculated using the test data, which included sensitivity and specificity for each species. The best performing class was the Eurasian Collared Dove, and the worst performing class was the Lesser Spotted Woodpecker. Additionally, the accuracy of the model was calculated for both the train and test splits.

After the model training, there is a description of the deployment and inferencing of the trained model in a test environment to evaluate the end-to-end pipeline. An example is given where an audio file was transmitted over 4G, segmented into 15-second windows, and passed through the feature extractor function using MFCC to extract features for the classifier. The predicted vector was then processed and logged to the site for review.

Therefore, while there is no direct mention of saliency maps or a confusion matrix, we can infer that performance metrics were calculated, and the model was deployed in a test environment to evaluate its effectiveness in a real-world scenario.
