The provided context does not contain information about the deployment of a deep learning model. Instead, it discusses the creation and evaluation of species distribution models (SDMs) using occurrence data and environmental variables. The SDMs were created using a training set that consisted of 75% of the available records, and the models' performance was evaluated using a variety of metrics, including AUC, Omission, TPR, Kappa, and TSS.

The SDMs were created at four different spatial extents and were subjected to five different treatments to test the impact of potential biases and errors. The treatments included using random backgrounds, spatial filtering of input data, and evaluating the models using different test sets.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query regarding the deployment of a deep learning model.
