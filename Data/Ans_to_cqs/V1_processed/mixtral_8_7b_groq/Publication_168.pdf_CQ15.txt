In the deep learning pipeline for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, the optimization technique used to optimize the connections (weights) of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm.

The SGD algorithm is used to minimize the cross-entropy cost function, which is defined as the negative log-likelihood of the correct class. The cross-entropy cost function is used to measure the difference between the predicted probabilities and the actual labels. By minimizing the cross-entropy cost function, the CNN can learn to predict the correct class probabilities for each pixel in the HSI.

The SGD algorithm is an iterative optimization algorithm that updates the weights of the CNN in the opposite direction of the gradient of the cost function. In other words, the SGD algorithm adjusts the weights of the CNN to reduce the cost function. The learning rate, which controls the step size of the weight updates, is a hyperparameter of the SGD algorithm.

In the paper, the authors used the SGD algorithm with a mini-batch size of 128 and a momentum of 0.9 to optimize the weights of the CNN. The momentum term in the SGD algorithm helps to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm by adding a fraction of the previous weight update to the current weight update.

The authors also mentioned that other optimization algorithms, such as Adam, could be used to optimize the weights of the CNN. However, they did not provide any experimental results using other optimization algorithms.

In summary, the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm is used to optimize the weights of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in the deep learning pipeline for hyperspectral image classification. The SGD algorithm minimizes the cross-entropy cost function by adjusting the weights of the CNN in the opposite direction of the gradient of the cost function. The learning rate and momentum are hyperparameters of the SGD algorithm. Other optimization algorithms, such as Adam, could also be used to optimize the weights of the CNN.
