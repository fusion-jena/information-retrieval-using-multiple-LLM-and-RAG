The performance of the deep learning models in the given context is evaluated using two metrics: Accuracy and F1-score. Accuracy is a measure of the proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions made, while the F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics. These metrics are commonly used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models, including deep learning models, as they give an understanding of how well the model is classifying the data. However, it is important to note that these might not be the only metrics used to evaluate the model's performance, and other metrics such as precision, recall, and area under the curve (AUC) could also be used depending on the specific problem and the business context.
