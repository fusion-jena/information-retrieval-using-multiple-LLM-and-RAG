The provided context does not include information about the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The text mentions the use of various machine learning models and techniques, such as grid search, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning, but it does not specify where the code for this pipeline is located. Additionally, the context focuses on a specific study related to water quality prediction, so it is unlikely that the code repository for a different deep learning pipeline would be included. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
