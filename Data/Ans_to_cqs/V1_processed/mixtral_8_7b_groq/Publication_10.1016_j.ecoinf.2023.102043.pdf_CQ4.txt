Based on the provided context, there are no explicit mentions of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling being applied in the described deep learning pipeline. The pipeline involves using YAMNet, a pre-trained deep neural network, for transfer learning in goat vocalization detection. The audio data is preprocessed through several steps, including converting to a monophonic channel, resampling at 16 kHz, extracting the spectrogram using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) magnitudes with 25 ms windows and 15 ms overlap, and calculating the Mel spectrogram with 64 bins in the range of 125â€“7500 Hz. These preprocessed features are then used as input for the YAMNet model, which extracts embeddings for classification.

The context focuses on the preprocessing and utilization of the YAMNet model for classification rather than data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide information on data augmentation methods applied in this specific pipeline, as they were not mentioned in the provided text.
