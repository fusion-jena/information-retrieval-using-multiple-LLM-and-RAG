The text provided does not mention any standard datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in the deep learning pipeline. Instead, it describes the creation and use of a specific dataset for cactus recognition in aerial images. The dataset is built for the Tehuacán-Cuicatlán Valley, located in Mexico, and contains images obtained under different daylight conditions and during different seasons to improve the model's accuracy and prevent overfitting. Data augmentation techniques, such as vertical and horizontal flips, are also used during training to enhance the network's performance. The focus of the text is on the custom-built dataset for this particular use case, rather than on standard datasets commonly used in deep learning.
