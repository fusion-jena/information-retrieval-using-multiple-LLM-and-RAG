The deep learning model in the context provided is trained on an Inter Core i7 machine with an NVIDIA GeForce 1080 GPU. This indicates that a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is used for training the model. GPUs are well-suited for deep learning tasks due to their ability to perform parallel processing, which is essential for the computationally intensive operations involved in training neural networks. However, the text does not mention the use of Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which are specialized hardware developed by Google for machine learning tasks.
