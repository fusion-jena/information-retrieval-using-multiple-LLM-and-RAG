Based on the provided context, there is no information given about the development or implementation of a deep learning model. The context focuses on data management principles, the design of a database for fish specimens, and the mapping of the database to the Observations and Measurements (O&M) model. Therefore, I cannot provide specific information on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, such as creating a diverse dataset, using cross-validation, or implementing stratified splitting.
