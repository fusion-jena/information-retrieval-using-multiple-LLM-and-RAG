Based on the provided context, there is no specific mention of the use of standard deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet in the context of predicting infectious diseases or vector-borne diseases. However, there are several sources that discuss the use of various datasets in the context of predicting infectious diseases and vector-borne diseases using machine learning and remote sensing techniques.

One study by Keshavamurthy et al. (2022) conducted a systematic review of machine learning and deep learning approaches for predicting infectious diseases for biopreparedness and response. The study mentions the use of various datasets such as "clinical data, laboratory data, epidemiological data, and environmental data" (Keshavamurthy et al., 2022). However, the study does not provide specific details on the datasets used in the deep learning pipelines.

Another study by Kaur et al. (2021) conducted a systematic review of machine and deep learning techniques for analyzing and minimizing the effects of vector-borne diseases. The study mentions the use of various datasets such as "climate data, topographical data, land use data, and vector distribution data" (Kaur et al., 2021). However, the study does not provide specific details on the datasets used in the deep learning pipelines.

In addition, there are several sources that mention the use of remote sensing data for predicting infectious diseases and vector-borne diseases. For example, one study by Laaksonen et al. (2017) used a crowdsourcing-based nationwide tick collection to reveal the distribution of Ixodes ricinus and I. persulcatus and associated pathogens in Finland. The study used various remote sensing datasets such as "topographical data, land cover data, and climate data" (Laaksonen et al., 2017).

Another study by Gachoki et al. (2024) used remote sensing data to predict the distribution of malaria in Kenya. The study used various remote sensing datasets such as "MODIS data, TerraClimate data, and Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station Data" (Gachoki et al., 2024).

Therefore, while there is no specific mention of the use of standard deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet in the context of predicting infectious diseases or vector-borne diseases, there are several sources that discuss the use of various datasets such as clinical data, laboratory data, epidemiological data, environmental data, climate data, topographical data, land use data, and vector distribution data in the deep learning pipelines for predicting infectious diseases and vector-borne diseases.
