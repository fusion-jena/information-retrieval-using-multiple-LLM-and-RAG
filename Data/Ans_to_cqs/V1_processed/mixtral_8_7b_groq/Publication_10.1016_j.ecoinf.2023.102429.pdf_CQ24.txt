The provided context does not contain information specific to strategies employed to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines. However, it does contain information about the use of the Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) method for estimating soil nutrient concentrations. In this context, randomness could be introduced in various stages of the PLSR model development, such as the selection of important spectral bands or the initialization of model parameters.

One way to handle randomness in the PLSR model development is through the use of cross-validation, which is a technique used to assess the performance and generalizability of a model by dividing the data into multiple subsets and training and testing the model on each subset. In the provided context, cross-validation is used in the form of R2, RMSE, RPD, and RPIQ metrics to evaluate the performance of the PLSR models.

Another way to handle randomness is by setting a seed value for the random number generator, which ensures reproducibility of the results. In the provided context, there is no mention of seed value initialization. However, it is a common practice in deep learning pipelines to set a seed value to ensure reproducibility of the results.

In summary, while the provided context does not contain specific information on strategies to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines, it does mention the use of cross-validation and the importance of reproducibility, which are relevant to handling randomness. To address the original query, it is common practice in deep learning pipelines to handle randomness by setting a seed value for the random number generator and using cross-validation techniques to assess model performance and generalizability.
