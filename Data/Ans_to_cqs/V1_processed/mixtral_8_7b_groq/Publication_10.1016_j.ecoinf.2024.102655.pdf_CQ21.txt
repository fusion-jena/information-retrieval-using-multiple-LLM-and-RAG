Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after training the machine learning models. The text only mentions that machine learning models are applied and their results are discussed in Sections 3 and 4. However, it is common practice in machine learning to perform certain postprocessing steps after training a model. These steps can include:

1. **Model evaluation metrics calculation:** After training a model, it is important to evaluate its performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve. These metrics provide insights into how well the model is making predictions.

2. **Confusion matrix:** A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model. It can be used to calculate various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

3. **Saliency maps:** Saliency maps are a way to visualize the importance of each input feature in making a prediction. They can be used to understand which features the model is relying on to make its predictions.

4. **Model interpretation techniques:** There are various techniques to interpret machine learning models, such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values, LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations), and partial dependence plots. These techniques can be used to understand how the model is making its predictions.

5. **Hyperparameter tuning:** Hyperparameters are parameters that are not learned from the data but are set before training the model. Examples include the learning rate, the number of hidden layers in a neural network, and the regularization strength. Hyperparameter tuning involves trying different values for these parameters and selecting the ones that result in the best performance.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention which postprocessing steps are taken after training the machine learning models, it is likely that some or all of these steps are performed.
