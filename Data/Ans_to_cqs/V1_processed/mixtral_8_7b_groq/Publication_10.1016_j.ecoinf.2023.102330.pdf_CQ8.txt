The code repository for the deep learning pipeline is available on GitHub. More specifically, it can be found at <https://github.com/GAMELab-UGA>. This repository contains all the R and JAGS code, sample data, and results generated during the current study. Additionally, it includes all the python source code used to design, train, and test the northern bobwhite detection model. A pre-trained model is also available for download in this repository. The researchers have made sure that the data and code are accessible to the public to promote further research and development in the field of acoustic detection using deep learning methods.
