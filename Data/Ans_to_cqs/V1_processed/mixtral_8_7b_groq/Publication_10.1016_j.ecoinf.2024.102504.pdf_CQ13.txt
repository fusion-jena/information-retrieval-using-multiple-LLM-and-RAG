The specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning models mentioned in the provided context are not given. However, some of the papers do mention the use of deep learning models for air quality prediction.

 Navares and Aznarte (2020) used a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for predicting air quality. Although they do not provide details about the hyperparameters, they do mention that they used the Adam optimizer and Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function.

 Gokul et al. (2023) also used an LSTM model for predicting PM2.5 levels in Hyderabad city. They used the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 and a batch size of 32. They also used early stopping to prevent overfitting.

 Chianese et al. (2019) used a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for predicting particulate matter concentration. They used the Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation algorithm as the optimizer and Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function. They also used a learning rate of 0.01 and a maximum of 1000 iterations.

 Therefore, while the specific hyperparameters used in the models are not provided for all papers, some common hyperparameters used in deep learning models for air quality prediction include the Adam optimizer, Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function, and a learning rate between 0.001 and 0.01. The batch size and number of iterations or epochs may vary depending on the specific dataset and computational resources available.
