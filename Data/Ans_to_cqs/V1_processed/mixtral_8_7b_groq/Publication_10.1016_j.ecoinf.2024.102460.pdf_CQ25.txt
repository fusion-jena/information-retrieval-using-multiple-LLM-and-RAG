Based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model mentioned is for time series forecasting. Specifically, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, a type of deep learning model, is used to solve the prediction problem of time series data. The LSTM model is used in a deep learning time series forecasting model called LSTM-PLUS-FMOP, which is constructed to analyze the historical processes and future trends of land use/cover change (LUCC). The LSTM model is used to predict land conversion trends, and it is chosen for its ability to manage the long-term dependency problem and multivariate time series data. The LSTM model is compared with the Back Propagation (BP) model and the Markov chain model for its prediction process. Therefore, the purpose of the deep learning model in this context is time series forecasting, particularly for predicting land use/cover change trends.
