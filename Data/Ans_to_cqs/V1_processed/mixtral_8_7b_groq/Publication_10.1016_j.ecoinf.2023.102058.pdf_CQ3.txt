The provided context does not include specific information about the data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. However, it does mention the use of hyperspectral data in deep learning models for predicting water quality parameters. In the context of remote sensing and hyperspectral imagery, data annotation techniques might include:

1. Pixel-level annotation: In this technique, each pixel in the image is labeled with a class or value representing the object or material it represents. For example, in the context of water quality, each pixel could be labeled with a value representing chlorophyll-a concentration, total suspended solids, or other relevant parameters.

2. Object-level annotation: In this technique, objects or regions of interest are segmented from the background and labeled with a class or value. This could be done using techniques such as bounding boxes, polygons, or instance segmentation. For example, in hyperspectral imagery of water bodies, objects of interest might include areas of algal blooms, sediment plumes, or other features indicative of water quality.

The context does mention a study by Maier et al. (2021) that used deep learning with simulated water quality data to estimate chlorophyll-a concentration in inland water bodies. However, the specific data annotation techniques used in this study are not mentioned in the provided abstract.

Therefore, while the context provides some insight into the use of deep learning with hyperspectral data for water quality prediction, it does not provide specific information about data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines.
