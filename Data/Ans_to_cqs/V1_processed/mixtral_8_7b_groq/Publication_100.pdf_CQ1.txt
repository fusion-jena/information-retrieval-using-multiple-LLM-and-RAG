In the context provided, the deep learning pipeline for remote sensing uses a combination of optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images as raw data for training the model. These images are acquired using sensors placed on satellites or aircraft.

For instance, in the study by Rustowicz et al. (2019), semantic segmentation of crop types in Africa is performed using a deep learning model. The raw data for this study consists of multispectral images acquired by the Sentinel-2 satellite, which is equipped with a high-resolution multispectral imager. Similarly, in the study by Schneider et al. (2017), functional diversity of forests is mapped using remotely sensed morphological and physiological forest traits. The raw data for this study includes hyperspectral images acquired by the Airborne Prism Experiment (APEX) sensor and LiDAR data acquired by the Small Footprint Laser Altimeter (SFLA) sensor.

In the context of deep learning for remote sensing, the raw data is typically collected through sensors placed on satellites or aircraft. These sensors capture images in various parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, such as optical and SAR images. These images are then used as input to train deep learning models for tasks such as image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection.

It is also worth noting that the raw data used in these studies is often obtained from public datasets. For example, the study by Senf et al. (2020) uses data from the Global Forest Change (GFC) dataset, which is a publicly available dataset that provides annual forest loss and gain data for the entire globe. Similarly, the study by Astrup et al. (2019) uses a Norway-wide timber volume map, which is also a publicly available dataset.

In summary, the raw data used in the deep learning pipeline for remote sensing is collected using sensors placed on satellites or aircraft. These sensors capture images in various parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, such as optical and SAR images. These images are then used as input to train deep learning models for tasks such as image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection. Additionally, the raw data used in these studies is often obtained from public datasets.
