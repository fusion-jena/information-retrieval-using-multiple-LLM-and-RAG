The specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline described in the text are not explicitly named or referenced in the provided context, unlike well-known datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, the text does mention that the datasets are related to flight activity recordings of bees and are divided into control and pesticide-exposed groups.

The datasets are prepared by combining raw and curated versions, which are accessible in the Code and Data Availability section. The data is then split using the train\_test\_split function from the scikit-learn library, with 70% of the data used for training and the remaining 30% for testing.

The deep neural network architecture is designed to incorporate three primary input parameters: the bee's age, the daily number of flights, and the total time spent outside daily. The model's performance is evaluated using conventional metrics, such as confusion matrices, accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, Cohen Kappa, and the area under the ROC curve.

In summary, while the specific names of the datasets are not provided, the context indicates that the datasets are related to bee flight activity recordings, and they are prepared and split for training and testing the deep learning model.
