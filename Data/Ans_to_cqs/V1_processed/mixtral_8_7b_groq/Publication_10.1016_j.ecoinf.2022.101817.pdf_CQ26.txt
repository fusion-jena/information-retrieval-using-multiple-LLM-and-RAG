The provided context discusses the use of deep learning models for image classification tasks, particularly in underwater environments and weather phenomenon classification. However, it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.

That being said, some common techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on certain criteria (e.g., class labels) and then randomly splitting each subgroup to ensure that each subset (e.g., training, validation, testing) has a similar distribution of these criteria.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of instances of the minority class in the dataset to balance it with the majority class.
3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class in the dataset to balance it with the minority class.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from various sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population.

While the provided context does not mention these techniques specifically, it does discuss the importance of data preprocessing and the use of various models and evaluation metrics. Therefore, it is likely that these techniques could be used in the preprocessing stage of the deep learning pipeline discussed in the context.
