The provided context does not contain specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for remote sensing applications. However, it does mention the use of various data sources such as LiDAR, UAV points clouds, hyperspectral data, and high-resolution RGB data for different tasks including tree species classification, canopy height estimation, and flood risk mapping.

In the context of remote sensing and geospatial analysis, some common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest in an image. It is useful for tasks such as object detection and image classification.
2. Polygon annotation: This technique involves drawing polygons around objects of interest, which can be more precise than bounding boxes, especially for irregularly shaped objects. It is useful for tasks such as semantic segmentation and instance segmentation.
3. Pixel-wise annotation: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image with its corresponding class. It is useful for tasks such as semantic segmentation and change detection.
4. Scribble annotation: This technique involves drawing rough lines or curves around objects of interest. It is useful for tasks such as weakly supervised semantic segmentation.
5. Point-wise annotation: This technique involves labeling individual points in point cloud data, such as LiDAR data. It is useful for tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation in 3D space.

The specific data annotation technique used would depend on the task at hand, the data available, and the resources available for annotation. It is also worth noting that some deep learning models, such as those based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can learn to extract features from raw data without the need for explicit annotation, through techniques such as unsupervised learning or self-supervised learning.
