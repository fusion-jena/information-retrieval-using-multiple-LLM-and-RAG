The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training can vary depending on the specific research and context. However, based on the provided context, the data for training a deep learning model to predict dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration was split into a training set and a validation set. Specifically, the data from the first eight days were used as the training set, and the data from the last two days were used as the validation set. This split was used for training and testing three different data processing methods using the proposed WTD-GWO-SVR method for predicting DO concentration levels.

It is worth noting that the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a separate test set, which is typically used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. However, the validation set can serve as a proxy for the test set, as it provides an estimate of the model's ability to generalize to new data.

In addition, the context mentions the use of other evaluation metrics such as R-squared (R2), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to assess the performance of different models. These metrics are commonly used to evaluate the accuracy and generalization ability of regression models, including deep learning models.

Overall, while the provided context does not provide a comprehensive overview of the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it does suggest that a training-validation split was used, and that other evaluation metrics were used to assess the model's performance.
