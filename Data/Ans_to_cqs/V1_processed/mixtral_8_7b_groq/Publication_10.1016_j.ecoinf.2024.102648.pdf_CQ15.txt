The provided context discusses the use of deep learning in predicting the percent disease incidence of Cotton Leaf Curl Disease (CLCuD) but it does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that some optimization technique was used during the training of the Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), a type of artificial neural network (ANN), as the context mentions that the training of the MLP was done using a training ratio of 0.80 and R2 value was calculated.

Optimization techniques are used to adjust the parameters of the model during training to minimize the loss function and improve the accuracy of the model. Some of the commonly used optimization techniques in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a simple optimization algorithm that updates the parameters of the model by taking a step in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function. However, it can be slow to converge and may get stuck in local minima.

Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation) is an optimization algorithm that combines the ideas of SGD and Momentum. It maintains an exponentially decaying average of past gradients and squared past gradients, which helps in adapting the learning rate for each parameter.

RMSprop (Root Mean Square Propagation) is an optimization algorithm that adapts the learning rate for each parameter by dividing the learning rate by an exponentially decaying average of the squared past gradients.

Adagrad (Adaptive Gradient Algorithm) is an optimization algorithm that adapts the learning rate for each parameter by dividing the learning rate by an exponentially decaying average of the past gradients.

Therefore, it can be inferred that one of these optimization techniques was used in the deep learning pipeline discussed in the context, but the specific optimization technique is not mentioned.
