The provided context does not include information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context mainly focuses on the structural re-parameterization techniques, the use of convolutional layers, and the comparison of the proposed model with existing model methods.

In general, data splitting for deep learning models is an essential step in the machine learning pipeline. The data is typically split into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and select the best model, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final model's performance.

The criteria used to split the data can vary depending on the specific problem and dataset. However, some common practices include:

1. Random sampling: This involves randomly splitting the data into the three subsets. This method is useful when the data is well-shuffled and there is no particular order or pattern.
2. Time-series split: When dealing with time-series data, it is essential to preserve the temporal order of the data. In this case, the data can be split chronologically, where the training set consists of the oldest data, the validation set consists of the intermediate data, and the testing set consists of the most recent data.
3. Stratified sampling: When the data is imbalanced or there are specific classes of interest, it is important to ensure that each subset has a representative sample of the data. Stratified sampling involves splitting the data based on the class labels, ensuring that each subset has a similar distribution of classes.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data, it is an essential step in the deep learning pipeline that should be carefully considered based on the specific problem and dataset.
