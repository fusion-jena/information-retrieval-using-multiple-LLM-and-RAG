Unfortunately, there is no direct information provided in the given context regarding the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The text mentions that a dataset was built for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify cacti in aerial images, and it discusses the importance of having a diverse dataset. However, it does not specify where this dataset is stored or how it can be accessed.

The creation of a dataset is an essential part of the deep learning pipeline, but it is just one part. A complete deep learning pipeline would include the dataset, the model architecture, the training process, and the evaluation of the model. It is possible that the authors have not made the dataset publicly available or have not provided a link to it in the given text.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query as it stands based on the information provided. If there is additional context or information available, I would be happy to revisit this question.
