The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. There is no information regarding techniques such as grid search, random search, or any other method for hyperparameter tuning. The text focuses on the use of the XGBoost model, SHAP method for interpretation, and ArcMap software for visualization and analysis. It also discusses the choice of the LSTM-CNN model for sentiment analysis, but it does not delve into the details of hyperparameter optimization for this model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
