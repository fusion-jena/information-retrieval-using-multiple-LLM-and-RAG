Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific preprocessing steps taken before training a deep learning model for wildfire event prediction. However, it can be inferred that the data used in the studies mentioned may have undergone some preprocessing.

In general, when training deep learning models, data preprocessing is a crucial step. Common preprocessing steps include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing or correcting erroneous or missing data. For instance, if there are missing values in the dataset, they can be imputed using techniques such as mean imputation, median imputation, or using advanced methods like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) or Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE).

2. Data Scaling/Normalization: Deep learning models are sensitive to the scale of the input features. Therefore, it is essential to scale or normalize the data. Techniques used include min-max scaling, where features are scaled between 0 and 1, and standardization, where features are scaled to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

3. Feature Engineering: This involves creating new features from existing ones to improve model performance. For example, polynomial features can be created from existing features to capture non-linear relationships.

4. Data Splitting: The dataset is typically split into training, validation, and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used for hyperparameter tuning, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance.

Given the context, it can be inferred that the data used in the studies may have undergone some of these preprocessing steps. For instance, in Halgamuge et al. (2020), an algorithm was developed to collect data automatically, which implies some form of data cleaning or preprocessing. Similarly, Dowdy (2020) measured spatio-temporal variations and seasonality across several datasets, suggesting that data preprocessing may have been involved.

However, the specific preprocessing steps are not provided in the context.
