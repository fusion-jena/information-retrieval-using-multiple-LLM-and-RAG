The provided context does not give specific information about the datasets used in deep learning pipelines such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context focuses on the use of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform for acquiring and processing Earth Observation System (EOS) data for ecological studies.

The GEE platform provides a solution for handling big data from multiple satellites, offering a compelling option for ecological studies due to its increasing capacity to store environmental data. The data acquisition and processing involve filtering, masking, and preprocessing of EOS data catalogs using functions such as ee.ImageCollection() and filterDate().

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query about the specific datasets used in deep learning pipelines.
