Based on the provided context, there are several preprocessing steps mentioned, although not exhaustively, that are involved before training a deep learning model.

Firstly, the context mentions the usage of high-resolution monitoring of fish length and catch numbers from landings using deep learning. This implies that the input data could be images or video frames that require preprocessing.

Another context mentions the usage of the YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 models for object detection and segmentation. These models are known to require preprocessing steps such as image resizing, normalization, and augmentation. Specifically, the context mentions that images are processed at a resolution of 1024 Ã— 1024.

Furthermore, the context mentions the usage of the Adam optimizer with a Momentum of 0.9 and a Batch size of 16. This implies that the input data is divided into batches for training, and normalization is applied to the data within each batch.

The context also mentions the usage of the initial learning rate set at 0.001 and a minimum learning rate of 0.0001. This implies that some form of learning rate scheduling is applied during training, which may require additional preprocessing steps such as learning rate warm-up or decay.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model could include image resizing, normalization, augmentation, batch division, learning rate scheduling, and potentially others depending on the specific model and use case.
