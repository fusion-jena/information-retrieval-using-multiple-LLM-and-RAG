The provided context does not specifically mention any optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. Instead, it focuses on the optimization of a machine learning model's hyperparameters for a regression task.

The optimization techniques discussed in the context include:

1. Grid search: This is an exhaustive search method where the model's performance is evaluated for all possible combinations of a predefined range of potential values for each parameter. In this case, the parameters explored are 'numberOfTrees', 'minLeafPopulation', 'bagFraction', and 'seed'. The goal is to find the combination of hyperparameters that minimizes the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and results in the most accurate predictions.

2. Cross-validation: This technique is used to evaluate the model's performance by dividing the dataset into multiple subsets, training the model on one subset, and testing it on another. This process is repeated for all subsets, and the average performance is calculated. Cross-validation helps ensure that the model generalizes well to new, unseen data.

While these techniques are relevant for machine learning model optimization, they do not directly address the optimization of deep learning pipelines, which typically involve optimizing the model's weights and biases using optimization algorithms like SGD or Adam.
