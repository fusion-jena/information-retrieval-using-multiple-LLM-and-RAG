After training the models, several postprocessing steps were taken to evaluate their performance and interpret the results. 

Firstly, various metrics were calculated to assess the models' performance. These metrics include Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Average Error (MAE), and the coefficient of determination (R²). The MSE was specifically focused on during the grid search to identify the optimal set of hyperparameters. 

Secondly, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values were computed using the model-agnostic Kernel SHAP method. This was done to understand which features are most important in predicting the start and height of the greening season. SHAP values provide a way to explain the output of any machine learning model by attributing a value to each feature involved in the prediction. 

However, the text does not mention the use of saliency maps or confusion matrices in the postprocessing steps. Saliency maps are often used in computer vision tasks to highlight the important features in an input image that the model used to make its prediction. A confusion matrix, on the other hand, is used to evaluate the performance of a classification model by comparing the predicted labels to the actual labels. Since the models in this study are regression models, a confusion matrix would not be applicable.

In summary, the postprocessing steps involved after training the models include the calculation of various metrics such as MSE, MAE, and R², as well as the computation of SHAP values to interpret the importance of each feature in the predictions. Saliency maps and confusion matrices were not mentioned as part of the postprocessing steps.
