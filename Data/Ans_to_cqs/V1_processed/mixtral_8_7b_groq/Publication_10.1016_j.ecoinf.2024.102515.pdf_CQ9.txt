The data repository of the study is available on GitHub, specifically at <https://github.com/PabloOtero/diversimar_paper>. However, it is not explicitly mentioned if this repository is mirrored on any other platforms such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, while the data is available on GitHub, I cannot confirm if it can be found on other data repository platforms.
