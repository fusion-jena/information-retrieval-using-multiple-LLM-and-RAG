The purpose of the deep learning model in the given context is for bird species recognition and classification. This is evident in the various studies and works cited, where deep learning models are used to identify and distinguish between different bird species based on their vocalizations.

For instance, Xie et al. (Xie and Zhu, 2019) compared different types of features for bird species classification, including hand-crafted acoustic features such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), visual features extracted from the Constant-Q Transform (CQT) time-frequency representation, and training a convolutional network directly on the CQT. They found that training a neural network directly on the CQT yielded the best performance.

Other successful contemporary works have also explored various types of neural networks as species recognizers, using inputs such as Short-Time Fourier-Transform (STFT) or spectrogram, mel-filterbanks applied on STFT (mel-spectrogram), and MFCC. These studies further highlight the use of deep learning models for bird species classification.

Moreover, the paper by Gupta et al. (2021) compared recurrent convolutional neural networks for large-scale bird species classification, indicating the continued development and application of deep learning models in this field.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model is for bird species recognition and classification.
