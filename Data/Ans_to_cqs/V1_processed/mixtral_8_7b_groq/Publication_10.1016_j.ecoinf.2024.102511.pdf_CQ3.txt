In the context provided, there is no explicit mention of specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for bioacoustic classification. However, I can provide some general information about common annotation techniques used in deep learning.

In computer vision, data annotation techniques include bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and panoptic segmentation. Bounding box annotation involves drawing a box around the object of interest in an image. Instance segmentation, on the other hand, involves segmenting each instance of an object in an image, providing a mask for each instance. Semantic segmentation involves segmenting an image by class, but does not differentiate between instances of the same class. Panoptic segmentation combines semantic and instance segmentation, providing a mask for each instance and class.

In the context of bioacoustic classification, data annotation may involve labeling audio recordings with the species or type of sound present. For example, in the study by Soldevilla et al. (2008), they classified Risso's and Pacific white-sided dolphins using spectral properties of echolocation clicks. The annotation process likely involved labeling the audio recordings with the corresponding dolphin species based on the spectral properties of the echolocation clicks.

In the context of machine learning for bioacoustic classification, tools such as BANTER may serve as an option for automated classification. The development of automated classification routines can improve the efficiency, reduce subjectivity, and decrease the cost of analyzing large datasets. Advances in computing have led to an increase in the opportunities to use machine learning for bioacoustic classification, including deep neural networks. These networks typically require significant sample sizes for all classes, and there are new tools to enhance data or combine disparate datasets.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for bioacoustic classification, common annotation techniques in deep learning include bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and panoptic segmentation. In the context of bioacoustic classification, data annotation may involve labeling audio recordings with the species or type of sound present.
