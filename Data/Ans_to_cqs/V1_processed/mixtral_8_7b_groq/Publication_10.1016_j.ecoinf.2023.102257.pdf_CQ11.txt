The provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses a study that used a machine learning (ML) model to improve tagging efficiency in data labeling, but it does not mention where the data or the deep learning pipeline used in the study can be found. Therefore, I am unable to provide the requested link.
