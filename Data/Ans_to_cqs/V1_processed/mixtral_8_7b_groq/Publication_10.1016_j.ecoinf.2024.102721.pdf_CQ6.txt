Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model for forecasting ecological water demand. However, it is a common practice in machine learning and deep learning to perform certain preprocessing steps to prepare the data for training. These steps can include data cleaning, normalization, and scaling.

Data cleaning involves handling missing or corrupted data points in the dataset. This can be done by imputation methods, where missing values are replaced with statistical estimates, or by removing the instances with missing data.

Normalization and scaling are techniques used to transform the data to a common scale, which can improve the training process and the model's performance. Normalization is the process of rescaling the data to a range of [0, 1] or [-1, 1], while scaling involves rescaling the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

In the context of the paper, the authors use the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) method for interpreting the predictions made by the LSTM model. SHAP assigns importance values to each feature in the dataset, indicating their contribution to the prediction. The SHAP formula provided in the context (Equation 14) includes the set of features S and its subset S âˆª i, which suggests that the data used in the study is likely to be preprocessed to handle missing or corrupted data points. However, there is no explicit mention of normalization or scaling.

Therefore, while the context does not provide specific information on the preprocessing steps taken for the deep learning model used in the study, it is still important to perform data cleaning, normalization, and scaling as standard preprocessing techniques for deep learning models.
