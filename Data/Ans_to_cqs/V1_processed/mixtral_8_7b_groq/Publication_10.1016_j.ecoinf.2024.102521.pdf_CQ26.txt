The provided context discusses the importance of data sharing and the use of deep learning in ecological research, specifically in the study of arthropods. However, it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.

That being said, some of the provided sources do touch upon data collection methods and the importance of diverse data. For instance, the Teixeira et al. (2023) review on automatic insect detection using deep learning highlights the need for diverse data collection methods to ensure the accurate detection of various insect species. They state that "the lack of diversity in the data sets used for training and testing the models can lead to poor generalization and poor performance in real-world scenarios."

Additionally, the Wang et al. (2020) paper on the Pest24 data set for multi-target detection of agricultural pests emphasizes the importance of large-scale data sets for training deep learning models. They provide a diverse data set of 24 agricultural pests, including various life stages and shooting angles, to improve the model's ability to detect different pests.

While not directly addressing data bias, these sources suggest that diverse data collection methods are crucial for accurate deep learning model training.

In terms of specific preprocessing techniques to address data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling, the context does not provide enough information. However, these techniques are commonly used in the field of machine learning to address data imbalance and bias.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, it does highlight the importance of diverse data collection methods for accurate deep learning model training. Specific preprocessing techniques to address data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling, are commonly used in the field of machine learning but are not mentioned in the provided context.
