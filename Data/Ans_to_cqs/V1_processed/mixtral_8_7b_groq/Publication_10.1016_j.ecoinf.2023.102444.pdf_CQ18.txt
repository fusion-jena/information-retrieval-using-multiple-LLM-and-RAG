In the provided context, a strategy to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned. However, it is described that they assessed UMAP as a binary classifier by calculating the area under the curve (AUC), receiver operating characteristics (ROC), kappa index K, and point-biserial correlation (COR) index. These evaluations were performed using probabilities for presence (species points, Sss) and absence (background points, Ssb). Therefore, it can be inferred that the performance of the UMAP model as a binary classifier was monitored by calculating these indices after training the model.

Moreover, they computed the nearest neighbor Euclidean distance between species-species (Dss) and background-species (Dsb) for both training and test data. Then, they calculated Pss, the cumulative empirical distribution function of the intra-species distance Dss. After that, they calculated S = (1- Pss) for the distances between the background and species. These calculations were done to analyze the similarity between a target species and its environment. Hence, it can be inferred that the model performance was also monitored by analyzing the distribution of these distances.

In summary, although the context does not explicitly mention a strategy to monitor the model performance during training, it can be inferred that the performance of the UMAP model as a binary classifier was monitored by calculating the AUC, ROC, kappa index K, and point-biserial correlation index. Additionally, the model performance was also monitored by analyzing the distribution of the nearest neighbor Euclidean distance between species-species and background-species.
