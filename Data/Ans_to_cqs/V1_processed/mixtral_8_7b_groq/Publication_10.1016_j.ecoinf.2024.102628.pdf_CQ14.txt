Based on the provided context, the hyperparameters of the model were optimized through a systematic process, but specific methods such as grid search or random search were not explicitly mentioned. The authors tuned the mtry hyper-parameter using the caret package in R while keeping other hyperparameters at their default values. They explored variations in the ntree parameter, experimenting with settings of 500, 1000, 5000, and 10,000. However, they did not mention if this was done using a systematic search over a grid or randomly.

Additionally, they used the findCorrelation function in the Caret package in R to select features prior to training. This function might have been used with a specific threshold or criteria to select the most relevant features, but the context does not provide enough information to confirm this.

In summary, although the context provides details about the hyperparameters that were explored and the general approach used for optimization, it does not explicitly mention the specific method (e.g., grid search, random search) used for hyperparameter optimization.
