The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training in Approach 1 of the study involves the use of confusion matrices and evaluation metrics. Specifically, the authors used confusion matrices to evaluate the performance of four pre-trained networks, namely EfficientNet-B0, ResNet101, MobileNetV2, and InceptionV3. A confusion matrix is a table layout that allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm in terms of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

In addition to confusion matrices, the authors also used evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model performance. These metrics are commonly used in machine learning to evaluate the performance of classification models.

Furthermore, the authors used the shortest sequence length during training and employed an every-epoch shuffle technique to ensure that the model was trained on different subsets of the data in each epoch. This strategy helps to prevent overfitting and improves the generalization of the model.

The authors also used the stochastic gradient descent with momentum (SGDM) optimization algorithm to train the models. SGDM is an optimization algorithm that uses momentum to accelerate the learning process and helps the model converge faster.

Finally, the authors used a composite numerical dataset in a mathematical array typology of [sampling location (Lm, Mo, Ob, Ta, and RF)] = [R, a*, b*, shell diameter] to train the models. The dataset consisted of 300 data-filled rows collected from five location sites in Portugal. The authors employed stratified sampling, where 80% (240 data rows) of the dataset was used for training the model, and 20% (60 data rows) was used for testing.

Overall, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training in Approach 1 of the study involved the use of confusion matrices, evaluation metrics, the shortest sequence length, every-epoch shuffle technique, SGDM optimization algorithm, and a composite numerical dataset.
