The provided context does not include information about the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text focuses on the methodology and results of a deep learning approach for wildfire response of forest species using multispectral LiDAR data. It discusses the importance of data augmentation and integrating synthetic data during the training phase of deep neural networks (DNNs) for semantic classifications of real LiDAR point clouds.

The authors mention using various models for semantic classification, such as LSSegNet3, RandLA-NET, PointCNN, and DCNN, but there is no information about the code repository or implementation details of the deep learning pipeline.

In summary, the provided context does not contain the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. Apologies for any inconvenience.
