The purpose of the deep learning model in the context of water quality management, as described in the article "Applications of deep learning in water quality management: A state-of-the-art review" by Wai et al. (2022), is to predict chlorophyll-a (Chl a) concentration. Chlorophyll-a is a commonly used proxy for algal biomass and a direct indicator to evaluate the ecological state of inland waters. 

The deep learning model used in this study is a Random Forest (RF) model, which is an ensemble learning method known for its resilience to data noise and ability to identify generalizable non-linear patterns. The RF model was trained on a dataset that was randomly divided into two subsets, with 75% of the data used for model training and 25% used for testing. The authors opted for random sampling to maintain the covariance structure among the predictor variables relatively intact between the training and testing datasets.

The deep learning model was used to elucidate the role of environmental stressors that modulate phytoplankton dynamics. The integration of sensor data with machine learning (ML) modeling is expected to offer a comprehensive strategy to understand the complex relationships between environmental stressors and phytoplankton dynamics. This approach advances our understanding more than the uncertain insights gained from complex overparameterized mechanistic models.

In summary, the purpose of the deep learning model in this study is to predict chlorophyll-a concentration, a direct indicator of the ecological state of inland waters, and to elucidate the role of environmental stressors that modulate phytoplankton dynamics. The RF model was chosen for its ability to identify generalizable non-linear patterns and its resilience to data noise.
