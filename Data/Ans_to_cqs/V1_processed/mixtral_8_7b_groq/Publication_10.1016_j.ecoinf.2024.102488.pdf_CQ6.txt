The provided context does not directly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does discuss some data processing and feature selection methods used in a specific study. These methods might provide some insights into possible data preprocessing steps.

In the study, the authors used Recursive Feature Elimination and Cross-Validation (RFECV) for feature selection (Liu et al., 2019). RFECV is a wrapper approach for feature selection based on cross-validation, and it can help reduce redundancy and improve model performance. This method may indirectly imply that data preprocessing steps like feature scaling or normalization were applied before feature selection.

In addition, the study combined multiple models' predictions using a column-wise manner (section 4.1, step 2) and used the Random Forest (RF) algorithm for generating prediction results (section 4.1, step 3). These steps suggest that the outputs of the base models were likely preprocessed to ensure consistency and compatibility before combining them.

Based on these observations and common practices in machine learning and deep learning, we can infer that the following preprocessing steps might have been involved before training a deep learning model:

1. Data cleaning: Removing or correcting erroneous, missing, or inconsistent data points.
2. Feature scaling or normalization: Adjusting features to a common range or scale to prevent any single feature from dominating the learning process.
3. Data transformation: Changing the representation of data, such as converting categorical data into numerical formats, if necessary.

However, it is essential to note that the provided context does not explicitly mention these preprocessing steps. The actual preprocessing steps would depend on the specific dataset and deep learning model used.
