Based on the provided context, there is no information about deploying a trained deep learning model. The text focuses on the use of machine learning models, particularly LightGBM, for land cover classification using multi-source data. It describes the data preparation, feature selection, and classification model building process in detail. However, it does not mention any steps related to model deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection.

The process described in the text includes:

1. Data preparation: The study used a variety of data sources, including C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, multispectral and hyperspectral data, and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data. These data were used to extract features for land cover classification.

2. Feature selection: The study used Recursive Feature Elimination and Cross-Validation (RFECV) to select the optimal features from the multi-source feature datasets. This process reduced the redundancy in the data and improved model performance.

3. Classification model building: The study used five base models, including TKNN, TRF, TAdaBoost, TXGBoost, and TLightGBM, to generate prediction results for the training and validation samples. These base models were then combined in a column manner to obtain T and V. The Random Forest (RF) algorithm was used to generate the prediction results of training data T by 5-fold cross-validation. The classification result B was obtained by voting.

However, the text does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, it is not possible to answer this query without additional information.
