The deep learning model is used for plant classification.

The deep learning model in question is built using the Lasagne module, which is constructed on top of Theano. The model's weights are initialized with pretrained weights from the ImageNet dataset, specifically from the Lasagne Model Zoo. The model is trained for 100 epochs on a GTX 1080 for a period of 6 days, using the Adam learning rule. During the training process, standard data augmentation techniques are applied, such as shearing, translation, and mirroring. However, rotation and upside-down mirroring are not applied to images tagged as 'habit' to maintain their original orientation. After applying these transformations, the images are downscaled to the ResNet standard size of 224 x 224.

The deep learning model used for plant classification is the ResNet model, which consists of a stack of residual blocks, each containing a stack of convolutional layers. The innovation of this architecture is the identity mapping path, which connects the output of a block to its input, alleviating the vanishing gradient problem and improving the gradient backward flow in the network. This allows for the training of much deeper networks. In this case, the model has 50 convolutional layers, also known as ResNet50.

Therefore, the purpose of this deep learning model is plant classification, leveraging the power of the ResNet50 architecture and pretrained weights from the ImageNet dataset.
