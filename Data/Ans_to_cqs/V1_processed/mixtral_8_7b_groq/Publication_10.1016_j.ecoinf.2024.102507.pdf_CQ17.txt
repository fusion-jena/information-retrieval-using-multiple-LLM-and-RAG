The provided context discusses the use of Dropout as a regularization technique in the deep learning model to prevent overfitting. Dropout is specifically mentioned in the context when describing the configuration of the models used in the study. It is applied to the model in two locations, both before and after a Dense layer with 256 neurons and ReLU activation. The Dropout rate is not specified in the context.

Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly drops out, or sets to zero, a fraction of the output features of a layer during training, which helps to prevent overfitting by promoting independence among the neurons. This is achieved by breaking the co-adaptations of neurons, which can lead to overfitting when the model is too complex and has too many parameters for the amount of training data available.

However, the context does not mention any other regularization methods such as L2 regularization, which adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This penalty term discourages large weight values, which can help to prevent overfitting by reducing the complexity of the model.

Therefore, based on the provided context, Dropout is the only explicitly mentioned regularization method used in the deep learning pipeline to prevent overfitting.
