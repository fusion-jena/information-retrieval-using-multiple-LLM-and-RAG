Based on the provided context, there are a couple of regularization methods mentioned that can be used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines.

One such method is dropout, which is a technique used during training to prevent over-dependence on any one neuron in the network. Dropout works by randomly "dropping out" or deactivating a proportion of neurons in a layer during each training iteration. This helps to promote diversity in the learned representations, reducing the risk of overfitting. Dropout was introduced in a paper by Geoffrey Hinton and his colleagues in 2012, although it is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

Another regularization method mentioned in the context is L2 regularization, which is a technique that adds a penalty term to the loss function to discourage large weights in the model. This penalty term is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights, which has the effect of shrinking the weights towards zero. By reducing the magnitude of the weights, L2 regularization helps to prevent overfitting by reducing the complexity of the model.

The provided context also mentions several tools and libraries that are commonly used in deep learning pipelines, including Keras, cuDNN, and Darknet. While these tools do not directly implement regularization methods, they provide a framework for building and training deep learning models that can incorporate regularization techniques.

For example, Keras provides a simple and flexible interface for building deep learning models in Python, and supports a variety of regularization techniques, including L1 and L2 regularization, dropout, and activity regularization. Similarly, cuDNN is a GPU-accelerated library for deep neural networks that provides optimized implementations of common deep learning operations, including convolution, pooling, and activation functions. While cuDNN does not directly implement regularization methods, it can be used in conjunction with other tools and libraries that provide regularization capabilities.

In summary, the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines include dropout and L2 regularization. These methods can be implemented using tools and libraries such as Keras, cuDNN, and Darknet, which provide a framework for building and training deep learning models that can incorporate regularization techniques.
