Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, we can infer that the model was likely serialized and then implemented on a specific platform for testing.

The context includes a performance test of each configuration (Table 3) and the standard deviation values for each performance metric (Table 4). This suggests that multiple models were trained and compared to determine the optimal configuration. Once the best model was identified, it would typically be saved using model serialization. Model serialization is the process of saving the trained model into a file, which can then be used for deployment.

As for the platform selection, the context mentions Fig. 8, which shows the performance test of each configuration. However, the figure itself is not provided. Based on the fact that the paper was published in Ecological Informatics, it is likely that the model was implemented on a computer or server for testing. The specific platform used for deployment is not specified in the context.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, it can be inferred that the model was likely serialized and implemented on a computer or server for testing.
