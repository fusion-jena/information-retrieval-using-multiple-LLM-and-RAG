Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, such as through grid search or random search. The text discusses the use of Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for ecological zoning, but it does not mention specific techniques for hyperparameter optimization.

In the context, it is mentioned that the learning rate Î·(t) in the SOM network decreases with time t, and the neighborhood of the output neuron j at time t is used in the clustering process. However, this does not pertain to hyperparameter optimization.

Furthermore, the text highlights the challenges of changing the number of categories in SOM networks and the training efficiency of SVM for large sample datasets. It also mentions the need for optimization of the training algorithm and the incorporation of remote connectivity ability into the model. However, these points do not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques.

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query regarding the optimization of hyperparameters, such as through grid search or random search.
