The specific deep learning frameworks used to build the models are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the models were likely built using popular deep learning libraries that support the chosen object detection models.

Two object detection models, YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN (FR-CNN), were compared in the study. YOLOv5 is known to be implemented using PyTorch, an open-source machine learning library based on the Torch library. On the other hand, Faster R-CNN can be implemented using either TensorFlow or PyTorch, as both libraries have implementations available for this model.

In summary, the deep learning models were likely built using either TensorFlow or PyTorch, but the specific framework is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
