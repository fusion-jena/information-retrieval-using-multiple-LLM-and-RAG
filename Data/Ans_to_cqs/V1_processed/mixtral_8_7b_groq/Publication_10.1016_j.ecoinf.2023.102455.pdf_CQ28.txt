Based on the provided context, there is no information that directly indicates which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model, such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform.

However, we can see that various deep learning models were trained and tested, including CNN-BiGRU, RVFL, KELM, CNN-BiRNN, and MVMD-CNN-BiRNN. The context includes the model architectures, hyperparameters, and performance metrics such as R, RMSE, and MAPE for each model during the training and testing phases.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the deep learning models were likely trained and tested on a local machine or a high-performance computing cluster rather than a specific cloud platform.

 The provided context does not contain information on which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it appears that the models were trained and tested on a local machine or high-performance computing cluster.
