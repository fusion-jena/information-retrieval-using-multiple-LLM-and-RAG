Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for the specific tool or project being discussed. However, we can make some educated guesses based on common practices in related fields.

In the context of environmental studies and water management, data collection often involves a combination of methods. Surveys and field measurements are commonly used to gather information about specific locations and conditions. For example, the USEPA document "Overcoming Barriers to Green Infrastructure" mentions weekly street sweeping and the use of Best Management Practices (BMPs) like WQ inlets and wet ponds, which would require regular monitoring and data collection.

Sensors and automated measurement systems are also frequently used to collect real-time data on environmental conditions. The USGS Watershed Boundary Dataset, for instance, is used to define and analyze watershed boundaries, which could involve sensor data to track water flow and quality.

Public datasets and repositories are another important source of raw data. In the context of machine learning and deep learning, these datasets might include water quality measurements, land use data, or demographic information. The study by Venkataramanan et al. on assessing environmental justice consequences of flood risk in Miami, Florida, likely used a combination of these data sources.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific details on the data collection methods used in the deep learning pipeline for this project, it is likely that a combination of surveys, sensor data, and public datasets are used to gather the necessary information for environmental analysis and water management.
