The provided context does not include specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of high-resolution images and a benthic organism dataset in the context of deep learning for aquaculture. Therefore, it can be inferred that image data is being used in this particular application of deep learning.

In general, there are several methods that can be used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, including:

1. Surveys: Surveys can be used to collect data through questionnaires or interviews. For example, a survey could be used to collect data on customer preferences, which could then be used to train a deep learning model for predicting customer behavior.
2. Sensors: Sensors can be used to collect data on physical phenomena, such as temperature, pressure, or motion. For example, sensors could be used to collect data on traffic patterns, which could then be used to train a deep learning model for predicting traffic congestion.
3. Public datasets: Public datasets are often available for use in deep learning research. These datasets can be a valuable resource for researchers, as they provide large amounts of labeled data that can be used for training deep learning models. For example, the ImageNet dataset is a popular public dataset that contains over 1 million images, which can be used for training image classification models.

In the context of the BoTNet model mentioned in the provided text, it is likely that high-resolution images were collected as raw data, and then used as input to the BoTNet model. The BoTNet model uses a convolutional layer to extract effective information and low-resolution feature maps from the input images, before inputting them for self-attention. This allows the model to avoid excessive memory and computational resource consumption.

Overall, while the provided context does not include specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it is likely that image data was collected in this particular application. In general, surveys, sensors, and public datasets can all be used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
