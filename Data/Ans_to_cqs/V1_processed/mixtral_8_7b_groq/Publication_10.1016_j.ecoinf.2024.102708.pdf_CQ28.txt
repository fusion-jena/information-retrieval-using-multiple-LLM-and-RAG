The provided context does not contain information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning models. The articles discuss the use of deep learning models such as FRCNN, TPH-YOLOv5, YOLOv5s, and YOLOv5m for mapping the density of Pacific oysters in protected areas using drone imagery and remote sensing. The models' performance is evaluated in terms of F-scores, standard errors, and confidence intervals. However, there is no mention of the cloud platform or infrastructure used for deploying these models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional information.
