The provided context does not contain specific information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline for environmental pollution or water quality management. However, I can provide a general explanation of some common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning.

Data augmentation is a strategy that enables increasing the diversity of training data by applying various transformations to the existing data. This approach is particularly useful when the available dataset is small, and it helps improve the model's performance and prevents overfitting. Some common data augmentation techniques in deep learning include:

1. Flipping: Flipping is a technique where the image is horizontally or vertically flipped. This transformation helps the model learn symmetrical patterns in the data.

2. Rotating: Rotating involves rotating the image by a certain angle. This technique helps the model learn to recognize objects at different orientations.

3. Scaling: Scaling involves changing the size of the image by zooming in or out. This transformation helps the model learn to recognize objects at different scales.

4. Translation: Translation involves shifting the image horizontally or vertically. This technique helps the model learn to recognize objects in different positions.

5. Color jittering: Color jittering involves changing the brightness, contrast, saturation, or hue of the image. This transformation helps the model learn to recognize objects under different lighting conditions.

6. Random cropping: Random cropping involves randomly selecting a portion of the image. This technique helps the model learn to focus on different parts of the image.

While the provided context does not mention these specific techniques, it is possible that some of these data augmentation strategies have been applied in the deep learning pipelines used in the studies mentioned. Nonetheless, the context does not provide enough information to confirm this.
