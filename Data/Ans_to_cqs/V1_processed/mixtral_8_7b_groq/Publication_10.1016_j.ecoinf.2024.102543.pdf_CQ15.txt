The provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the YOLOv8 deep learning pipeline. However, it is common practice to use optimization algorithms like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) during the training of deep learning models.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is an optimization algorithm that updates the model parameters in the direction that minimally reduces the loss function. It is simple and efficient, but can sometimes converge slowly or to a suboptimal solution.

Adam, on the other hand, is a more advanced optimization algorithm that combines the ideas of SGD with momentum and adaptive learning rates. It has been shown to perform well in many deep learning applications, including object detection.

Given that YOLOv8 is a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm, it is likely that an optimization algorithm like Adam is used during training. However, this information is not explicitly provided in the context, so it is only an educated guess.

In summary, while the provided context does not specify the optimization techniques used in the YOLOv8 deep learning pipeline, it is common practice to use optimization algorithms like SGD and Adam during the training of deep learning models.
