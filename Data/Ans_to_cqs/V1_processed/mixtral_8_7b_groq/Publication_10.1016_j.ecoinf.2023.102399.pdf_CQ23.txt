Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some implicit indications that suggest that the authors might have taken steps to ensure the model's generalizability.

Firstly, the context mentions a figure comparing the model effects of DL-YOLO and YOLOv5n, which suggests that multiple models were used or compared. This could imply that some form of cross-validation or comparison between models was performed to ensure that the chosen model generalizes well.

Secondly, the context includes a table with weights and standard deviations (W Â± STD), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean relative error (MRE) for different datasets. This suggests that multiple datasets were used, which could indicate an attempt to ensure the model's generalizability by training it on diverse data.

Thirdly, the context mentions a study on estimating dimensions of free-swimming fish using 3D point distribution models and another study on an affordable and easy-to-use tool for automatic fish length and weight estimation in mariculture. These studies likely provided additional datasets for the deep learning model, further increasing its diversity and potentially improving its generalizability.

Lastly, the context includes a study on exploring explainability of a fully convolutional neural network using principal component analysis with marine data. This suggests that the deep learning model was applied to a specific domain (marine data), and the authors might have taken steps to ensure the model's generalizability within this domain.

In conclusion, while there is no explicit information on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the implicit indications suggest that the authors might have used multiple models, diverse datasets, and domain-specific data to improve the model's generalizability. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
