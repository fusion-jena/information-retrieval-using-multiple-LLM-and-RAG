The provided context discusses the Random Forest (RF) model, a machine learning algorithm used for regression and classification, but it does not mention deep learning models. Therefore, I will provide an answer based on common practices for splitting data in deep learning model training.



In deep learning model training, data is typically divided into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. These subsets serve different purposes during the model development process.

1. Training Set: This is the primary dataset used to train the model. The model learns the underlying patterns and relationships within the data by iteratively adjusting its parameters based on the training data.

2. Validation Set: Also known as the development set, this dataset is used to tune hyperparameters and evaluate the model's performance during the training process. Hyperparameters are high-level settings that cannot be learned from the data, such as the learning rate, batch size, or the number of layers in a neural network. The validation set helps to ensure that the model does not overfit the training data and provides a means to compare different model configurations.

3. Testing Set: This is the final dataset used to evaluate the model's performance after training and hyperparameter tuning. The testing set provides an unbiased estimate of the model's generalization ability on unseen data. It is essential to reserve a sufficient portion of the data for testing, as it helps to assess the model's real-world performance and avoid overoptimistic evaluations based on the training or validation sets.

The criteria for splitting the data into these subsets can vary depending on the specific problem and dataset. Common approaches include:

1. Random Sampling: Data is randomly divided into the three subsets with predefined proportions, such as 60% for training, 20% for validation, and 20% for testing.

2. Stratified Sampling: When the data contains categorical variables with imbalanced class distributions, stratified sampling ensures that each subset contains a representative proportion of each class.

3. Time-based Sampling: For time-series data, it is essential to maintain the temporal order of the data. In this case, the data can be split based on time, using the earliest data for training, followed by the validation set, and finally the testing set.

In summary, deep learning model training typically involves splitting the data into training, validation, and testing subsets. These subsets serve different purposes during the model development process, and the criteria for splitting the data can vary depending on the specific problem and dataset.
