The provided context discusses the use of a deep learning system for fish biomass estimation, but it does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the pipeline. However, it does imply the use of bounding box annotation.

Bounding box annotation is a common data annotation technique used in object detection tasks, which is a crucial part of many deep learning pipelines. In the context of fish biomass estimation, bounding boxes could be used to annotate the fish in underwater images. This would involve drawing a box around each fish in the image, providing the coordinates of the box's corners to define its location and size. This information would then be used to train the deep learning model to detect and recognize fish in new images.

The context also mentions the use of the YOLOv5 model, which is a popular object detection model that uses bounding box annotation. The YOLO (You Only Look Once) models are known for their ability to perform real-time object detection, making them suitable for the detection of free-swimming fish in underwater images.

While the context does not mention instance segmentation, it does discuss the use of image processing techniques such as segmentation, erosion, and angle correction. These techniques are often used in data annotation pipelines that involve segmentation segmentation, which is a more detailed form of annotation than bounding box annotation. In segmentation, each pixel of an object is annotated, providing a more precise outline of the object. However, the context does not provide enough information to confirm whether segmentation was used in this particular deep learning pipeline.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for fish biomass estimation, it implies the use of bounding box annotation and mentions the use of the YOLOv5 model, which uses bounding box annotation. The context also mentions the use of image processing techniques such as segmentation, but it does not provide enough information to confirm whether segmentation was used for data annotation.
