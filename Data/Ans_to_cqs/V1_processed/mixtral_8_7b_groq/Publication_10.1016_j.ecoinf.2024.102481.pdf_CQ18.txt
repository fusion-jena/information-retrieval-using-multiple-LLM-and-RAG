The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of Out-Of-Bag (OOB) error. This approach involves training the model on bootstrapped data, where a portion of the data is excluded at each iteration and used as validation data for calculating generalization error. This error measure is used for tuning two hyperparameters: the number of covariates randomly selected prior to the growing of each tree (mtry) and the number of trees (ntree) combined for the forest. In this case, the optimal values obtained for these hyperparameters are mtry = 2 and ntree = 500. This method allows for an evaluation of the model's ability to generalize to unseen data, providing a robust measure of its performance during the training process. Additionally, other metrics such as Cohen's kappa coefficient, Precision, Sensitivity, Specificity, and Prevalence are used to further assess the model's performance.
