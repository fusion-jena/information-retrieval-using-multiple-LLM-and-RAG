Based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the approach are not explicitly stated as accuracy, precision, or recall, which are commonly used metrics for evaluating deep learning models. Instead, the context describes the development and use of custom metrics for the specific approach.

The custom metrics are derived from the sample variance and other measures, computed using the reference data and plotted as a function of the measured distances. These metrics exhibit a linear trend when both the metric and distance are plotted in logarithmic scale, leading to the use of linear models for regression analysis. The resulting power law relationship between the metric and distance provides a way to evaluate the performance of the approach.

The context also mentions that the metrics have different behaviors for different classes and values of L, a parameter related to the number of pixels considered. Specifically, for the "class" a minimum number of pixels should be used for the computation of the sample variance, and the NSL metric performs best for the "Other Plants" class.

Therefore, while the context does not directly mention the use of accuracy, precision, or recall, it describes the development and use of custom metrics tailored to the specific approach for evaluating its performance.
