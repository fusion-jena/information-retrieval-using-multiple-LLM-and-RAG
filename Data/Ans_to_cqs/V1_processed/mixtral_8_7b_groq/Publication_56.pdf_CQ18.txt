The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of a validation dataset, which consists of 30% of the total data. This validation dataset is separate from the training dataset, which makes up 70% of the total data. The validation dataset is used to assess the performance of the model as it is being trained, providing a means to evaluate the model's ability to generalize to new data.

The training process involves the use of a type of artificial neural network known as a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. The LSTM network uses input gates and forget gates to control the flow of information into and out of the memory cells of the network. The input gate determines which information is stored in the memory cell, while the forget gate decides which content of the existing memory cell is forgotten. This allows the network to selectively retain and forget information, enabling it to learn from sequential data.

The performance of the LSTM network is evaluated by comparing the predictions it makes for the validation dataset to the actual values. This comparison allows for the calculation of various performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics provide a means to assess the quality of the model's predictions and to monitor its performance during training.

In addition to these metrics, the conducted analysis demonstrates the importance of the red and near infrared Sentinel-2 bands and the features derived from summer acquisitions in the classification process. This information can be used to further interpret the model's predictions and to gain a better understanding of the behavior of the network.

Overall, the strategy for monitoring the model performance during training involves the use of a validation dataset, the calculation of performance metrics, and the interpretation of the model's predictions in the context of the relevant predictors and temporal information.
