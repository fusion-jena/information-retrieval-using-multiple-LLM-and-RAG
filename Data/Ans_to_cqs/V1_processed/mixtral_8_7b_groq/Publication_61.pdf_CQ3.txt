The provided context discusses the use of a dataset for cactus recognition in aerial images using a deep learning approach. However, it does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.

In general, data annotation techniques for deep learning models can vary depending on the specific task and dataset. For object detection tasks, techniques such as bounding box annotation and instance segmentation are commonly used. Bounding box annotation involves drawing a box around the object of interest in an image, while instance segmentation involves segmenting each instance of an object in an image and labeling it separately.

In the context of the cactus recognition task, it is possible that the dataset was annotated using bounding box annotation, where a box was drawn around each cactus in the aerial images. However, the provided context does not mention the specific annotation technique used.

It is worth noting that the dataset used in the study was built specifically for the task of cactus recognition in aerial images, due to the lack of previous information. The dataset was built using a methodology that involved obtaining examples under different conditions, such as different daylight conditions and seasons. This was done to improve the accuracy of the deep learning model and prevent overfitting.

Overall, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for cactus recognition, it highlights the importance of building a dataset with diverse examples for accurate deep learning model performance.
