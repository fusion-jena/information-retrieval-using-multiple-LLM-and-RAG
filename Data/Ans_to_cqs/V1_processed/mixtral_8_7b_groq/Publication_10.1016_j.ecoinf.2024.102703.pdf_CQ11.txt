I'm sorry, but the provided context does not include information about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. The context discusses research related to the ecological informatics of plateau lakes in southwest China, specifically focusing on the Erhai watershed in Yunnan Province. The researchers examined the sampling sites, the complexity of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), and the impact of nutrient and environmental factors on fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM). They used the LASSO model for variable selection and statistical regularization. However, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link in the provided text.
