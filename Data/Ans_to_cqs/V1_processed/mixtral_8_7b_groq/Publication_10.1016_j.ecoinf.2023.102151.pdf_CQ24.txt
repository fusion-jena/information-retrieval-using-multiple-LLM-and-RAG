The provided context does not directly discuss the strategies employed to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does describe a growth algorithm in the context of soil science that uses a normal distribution to introduce randomness in a controlled manner. This algorithm applies a probability function in all directions at each growing step, resulting in a preferred direction for growth with some degree of randomness. The growth is limited by a global radius Rgrow, which controls the overall size of the root.

In the context of deep learning, randomness can be introduced and managed in several ways. One common method is using a random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results across different runs. This seed value initializes the random number generator used in various parts of the deep learning pipeline, such as weight initialization, dropout, data shuffling, and batch sampling. By setting a fixed seed value, researchers can ensure that the same set of random numbers is used in each run, leading to consistent results.

Another way to handle randomness in deep learning is through regularization techniques like dropout. Dropout randomly sets a fraction of input neurons to zero during training, preventing overfitting and improving the model's generalization capability. The dropout rate, which determines the fraction of neurons to be dropped, can be considered a form of controlled randomness introduced into the model.

In conclusion, while the given context does not directly address the strategies employed to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines, general practices include using a random seed value for reproducibility and techniques like dropout for regularization. These methods help manage randomness and improve deep learning model performance.
