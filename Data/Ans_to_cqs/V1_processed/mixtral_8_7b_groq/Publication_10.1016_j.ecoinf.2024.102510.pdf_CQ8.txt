The provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. There is no mention of GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other code repositories in the context. The context mainly focuses on the performance comparison of different models for bird species recognition using various feature extractors and fine tuners.

Therefore, I cannot provide the location of the code repository based on the given context. However, it is always a good practice to make the code repositories publicly available for reproducibility and transparency. If you are interested in the code, I would recommend contacting the authors of the study or checking their online profiles for any available repositories.
