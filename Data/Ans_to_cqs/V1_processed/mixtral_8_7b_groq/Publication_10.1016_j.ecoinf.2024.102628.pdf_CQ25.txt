The deep learning model in question is used for a classification problem. More specifically, it is employed for the classification of 2D point cloud images derived from LiDAR data in a forested environment. The model's purpose is to accurately identify and categorize different types of vegetation and terrain, with the target classes being "Plateau", "White-sand", and "Riparian". This is achieved through the use of a pre-trained ResNet-34 architecture within the fast.ai framework, which is particularly useful given the small size of the dataset. The model is trained and validated using a LOGO (Leave-One-Group-Out) cross-validation approach, ensuring that every multitemporal transect undergoes both training and testing, while preventing the transfer of information from one fold to another.
