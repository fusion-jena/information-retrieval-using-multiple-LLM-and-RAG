The provided context discusses the use of image data in a deep learning pipeline for fish tracking and counting. Specifically, it mentions the use of an image dataset with annotations containing fish bounding box data. These annotations include x and y coordinates, width, and height of the fish. Therefore, it can be concluded that the data format used in this deep learning pipeline is an image format, likely in the form of photographs or video frames, with accompanying annotation data in a format such as CSV or JSON.

The context also mentions the use of data augmentation techniques, including horizontal flipping, grayscale conversion, blurring, adding noise, and cropping. These techniques are applied to the image data to increase the amount of available information and reduce overfitting. Therefore, it can be inferred that the data augmentation techniques are also performed on image data.

In summary, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline discussed in the provided context is image data, potentially in the form of photographs or video frames, with accompanying annotation data in a format such as CSV or JSON. Data augmentation techniques are applied to the image data to increase the amount of available information and reduce overfitting.
