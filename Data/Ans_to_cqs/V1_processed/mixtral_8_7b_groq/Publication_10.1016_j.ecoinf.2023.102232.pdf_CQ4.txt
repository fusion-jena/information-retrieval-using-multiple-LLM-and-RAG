Based on the provided context, the described process does not involve any deep learning pipeline or data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The described process is an explanation of a two-step algorithm for estimating parameters in Precision Agriculture (PA). The first step is the Least Squares (LS) algorithm, which orders the entries of a database from smaller to higher sums of residual values. The second step is a genetic algorithm that uses the first quarter of the best fit parameter values from the LS algorithm as input for an iterative optimization process. This algorithm generates random combinations of initial values and stores the results in the database. The rows of the database are then reordered according to the sum of the residual values. This process can be repeated an arbitrary number of times.

The computations were carried out using the DAFNE HPC scientific computing center of the Universit`a degli Studi della Tuscia, which provides two Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) ProLiant DL560 Gen10 nodes, each equipped with four processors, Intel Xeon Gold 5118 2.30GHz, 12 cores, 24 threads, and 512 GB of RAM. The two nodes worked in a parallel configuration managed by the Python 3.6.8 package Ray, version 1.9.2.

Therefore, the provided context does not contain information on data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline.
