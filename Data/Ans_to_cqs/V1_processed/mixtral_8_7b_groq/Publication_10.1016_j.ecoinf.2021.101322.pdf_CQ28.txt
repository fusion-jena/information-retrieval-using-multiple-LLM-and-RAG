The provided context does not contain information about the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It only mentions that the CNN was implemented using the Keras and TensorFlow software packages in Python, and computation was performed using CUDA version 9.1 and CuDNN with Nvidia P100 accelerator cards with 12 GB of GPU memory. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
