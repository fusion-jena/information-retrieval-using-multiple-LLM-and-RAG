The deep learning model in question is designed for the purpose of classification, specifically for species identification in the context provided. 

In the first phase, a classification model is built by training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on a given database T0. CNNs are composed of neurons organized in layers, with the specificity of building a descriptor for the input image data and the classifier at the same time. This ensures both are optimized for each other, and neurons extracting characteristics from the input data to build the descriptors are called convolutional neurons.

After the model training phase, the second phase consists of tuning a risk threshold Ï„i specific to each class (i.e. each species), using a second and independent database T1. This tuning process transforms the 2 classification options (correct, wrong) into 3 options by applying certain equations.

The output of the model for an image X from the threshold tuning dataset is a set {C(X), S(X)}, where C(X) is the class (i.e. species) with the highest classification score S(X). The ground truth Y, belonging to the same set of species classes, is known for this image.

The deep learning model's purpose, therefore, is to accurately classify species using a CNN, with the added flexibility of tuning species thresholds for classification robustness and coverage. This is particularly useful for monitoring biodiversity through big datasets where species are unidentified, helping ecologists control error rates in their analysis of big data and real-time biodiversity monitoring from remote sensors.
