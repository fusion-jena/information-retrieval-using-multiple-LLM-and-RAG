The context provided does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it does mention that using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) such as the CRNN model requires more computing resources for training. This implies that the training was done on a powerful computational device, which could be a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) or a Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). These types of hardware are commonly used for training deep learning models due to their ability to perform parallel processing, which significantly speeds up the training process. Nonetheless, the specific hardware used in this case is not mentioned in the context.
