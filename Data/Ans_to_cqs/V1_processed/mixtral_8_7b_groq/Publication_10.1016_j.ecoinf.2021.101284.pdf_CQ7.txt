Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The text focuses on the use of multiple linear regression (MLR) models and the preprocessing of data for those models.

However, it is important to note that the process of splitting data for deep learning model training typically involves dividing the dataset into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. This is a common practice in machine learning to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.

The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final model performance. The specific criteria for splitting the data can vary depending on the problem, dataset, and model requirements. Common methods include random sampling, stratified sampling, or time-series-based splitting.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it is a standard practice to divide the dataset into training, validation, and testing subsets. The choice of splitting method depends on the specific problem and dataset.
