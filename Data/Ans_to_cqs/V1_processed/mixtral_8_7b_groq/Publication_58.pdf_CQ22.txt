The performance of the deep learning models is evaluated using four quality metrics: Overall Accuracy (OA), Producer Accuracy (PA), User Accuracy (UA), and the F1-score. The Overall Accuracy (OA) is calculated as the sum of the diagonal of the confusion matrix. Producer Accuracy (PA) is the number of well-ranked individuals divided by the sum of the column in the confusion matrix. User Accuracy (UA) is the number of well-ranked individuals divided by the sum of the line. The F1-score is calculated as the harmonic mean of precision and recall, giving equal importance to both PA and UA. These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the models for both Land Cover (LC) and Land Use (LU) detection tasks.
