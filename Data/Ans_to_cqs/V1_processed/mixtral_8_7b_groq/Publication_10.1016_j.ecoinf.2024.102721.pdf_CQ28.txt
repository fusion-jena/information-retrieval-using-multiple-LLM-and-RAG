The provided context does not contain information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The text focuses on the development and application of a deep learning model for forecasting ecological water demand in an arid oasis under a drying climate scenario. The authors describe the structure of the long- and short-term memory model neural network used in their study, but they do not mention the platform used for deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
