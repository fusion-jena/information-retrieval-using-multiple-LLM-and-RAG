The deep learning model in question is designed for object detection, specifically for real-time species recognition in the context of ecological research. This is evident from the comparison of the model with state-of-the-art deep learning models for performance enhancement, focusing on improvements in Frames Per Second (FPS), model parameters, and Floating Point Operations Per Second (FLOPs). The model's purpose is to provide rapid analysis, which is critical for conservation efforts, particularly in remote areas where computational resources might be limited. The model's efficient design, including a reduced number of parameters and FLOPs, contributes to its faster model loading time. Furthermore, the backbone network of the model, YOLOv5s, is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that excels in various applications, particularly in extracting high-level image features for object detection. The WildARe-YOLO model, a variant of YOLOv5s, integrates MBBlocks from MobileNetV2 to replace certain components of the original model, further optimizing it for ecological research needs.
