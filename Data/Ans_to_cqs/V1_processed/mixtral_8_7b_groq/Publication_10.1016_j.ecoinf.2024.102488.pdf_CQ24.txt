The provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. However, it does mention the use of various machine learning algorithms, including ensemble methods like Random Forest, Adaptive Boosting, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Light Gradient Boosting Machine. While these are not deep learning methods, they do employ strategies to handle randomness.

Random Forest, for example, is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their outputs to improve prediction accuracy. It includes randomness in the form of bootstrap sampling and feature randomness. Bootstrap sampling involves randomly selecting a subset of the training data for each tree, which helps reduce overfitting and improves generalization. Feature randomness, on the other hand, involves selecting a random subset of features for splitting at each node, which further reduces overfitting and helps the algorithm explore the feature space more effectively.

Adaptive Boosting and Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (both in their original and extreme/light variants) are other ensemble methods that build multiple models sequentially, where each new model tries to correct the errors of the previous one. They also employ randomness, mainly in the form of initializing the weights of the training instances. In Adaptive Boosting, these weights are updated after each round based on the errors of the previous model, while in Gradient Boosting Decision Trees, the weights are used to calculate the gradient of the loss function.

Deep learning methods, such as neural networks, also employ strategies to handle randomness. Initializing weights randomly is a common practice to break symmetry and ensure that different neurons learn different features. Other strategies include using dropout layers to randomly remove neurons during training, which helps prevent overfitting, and using different data augmentation techniques, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling images, to increase the size and diversity of the training set.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, it does mention the use of machine learning algorithms that employ randomness to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting. Deep learning methods, such as neural networks, also employ strategies to handle randomness, such as initializing weights randomly, using dropout layers, and applying data augmentation techniques.
