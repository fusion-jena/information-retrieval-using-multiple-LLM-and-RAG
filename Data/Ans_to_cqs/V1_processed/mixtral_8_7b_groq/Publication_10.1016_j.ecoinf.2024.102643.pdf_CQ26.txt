The provided context discusses various machine learning models and techniques used in the field of ecology and conservation, but it does not directly mention the data bias mitigation techniques during deep learning preprocessing. However, I can provide some common techniques used to address data bias in the context of machine learning and data science, which can also be applied to deep learning.



During the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, data bias can be addressed using several techniques:

1. **Stratified splitting**: When splitting the data into training, validation, and testing sets, it is essential to maintain a similar distribution of classes in each subset. Stratified sampling ensures that each subset has a proportion of samples that reflects the original dataset's class distribution.

2. **Oversampling**: In cases where one class is underrepresented, oversampling can be used to balance the dataset. This technique involves replicating samples from the minority class to match the number of samples in the majority class. However, this may lead to overfitting, and techniques like Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) can be used instead.

3. **Undersampling**: Alternatively, undersampling can be applied to the majority class to balance the dataset. This technique involves randomly removing samples from the majority class to match the number of samples in the minority class. However, this may result in loss of valuable information.

4. **Diverse data collection**: To minimize data bias, it is crucial to collect data from diverse sources, ensuring that the dataset is representative of the entire population. This technique helps to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data.

5. **Reweighing**: In some cases, it might be beneficial to assign different weights to classes based on their importance or representation in the dataset. This technique can help the model pay more attention to underrepresented classes during training.

While the provided context does not specifically mention these techniques, they are widely used in the data science and machine learning communities to address data bias during preprocessing.
