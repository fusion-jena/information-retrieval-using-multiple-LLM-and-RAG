I don't have enough information to accurately answer the query regarding the process followed to deploy a specific deep learning model. The provided context includes research articles related to urban areas, vegetation, and wild rabbit conservation, but there is no mention of any deep learning model, its training, or deployment process.

In general, the process of deploying a trained deep learning model involves several steps:

1. Model serialization: After training the deep learning model, the model's architecture, weights, and biases are saved to a file, often in a format like HDF5 or JSON. This allows the model to be easily loaded and used for making predictions on new data.

2. Platform selection: The choice of platform for deploying the deep learning model depends on the specific use case and the required computational resources. Common platforms include local machines, cloud services (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud), and edge devices (e.g., smartphones, IoT devices). The selected platform should provide the necessary hardware acceleration (e.g., GPUs) and software support (e.g., deep learning frameworks) for efficient model execution.

3. Model optimization: To ensure efficient deployment, the deep learning model might need to be optimized for the target platform. This can involve techniques like model pruning, quantization, or distillation to reduce the model's size and computational requirements without significantly affecting its performance.

4. Integration with applications: The trained deep learning model is typically integrated into a larger application or system that uses the model's predictions to provide value to the end-users. This might involve building a web application, a mobile app, or a backend service that accepts input data, processes it using the deep learning model, and returns the predictions.

5. Monitoring and maintenance: After deploying the deep learning model, it is essential to monitor its performance and maintain it over time. This includes tracking metrics like prediction accuracy, latency, and throughput, as well as addressing any issues that arise due to changes in the input data or the target environment.
