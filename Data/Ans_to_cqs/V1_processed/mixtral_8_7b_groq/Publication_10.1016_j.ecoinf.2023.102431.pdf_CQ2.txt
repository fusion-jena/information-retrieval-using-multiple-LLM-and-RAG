The provided context does not give information about a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of camera trap images and the extraction of morphometric variables from tracks.

For the camera trap images, the data format used is likely to be image files, such as JPEG or PNG. The study uses these images to create a reference dataset of known species for fisher and marten, and to develop a method for identifying sex from the images.

For the tracks, the data format used is not explicitly stated. However, it is mentioned that 167 marten and 367 fisher tracks were geo-referenced using 7 landmark points, and 124 morphometric variables (distances, angles, and areas) were extracted from the tracks. It is likely that the tracks were stored in a digital format, such as a CSV or Excel file, which allowed for the extraction and analysis of the morphometric variables.

Overall, the study uses a combination of image and tabular data formats in its analysis. The image data is used for species identification, while the tabular data is used for morphometric analysis and sex identification.
