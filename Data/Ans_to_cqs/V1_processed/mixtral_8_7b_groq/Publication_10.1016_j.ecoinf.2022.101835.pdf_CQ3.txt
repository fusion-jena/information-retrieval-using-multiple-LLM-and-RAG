I'm sorry, but the provided context does not contain information about data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context focuses on the comparison of machine learning algorithms, specifically Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), for predicting ecological events. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given information.
