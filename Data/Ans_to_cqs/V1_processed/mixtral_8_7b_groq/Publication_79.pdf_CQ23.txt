The generalizability of the deep learning model was ensured through a variety of measures, including the use of a diverse dataset, cross-validation, and data augmentation techniques.

Firstly, the study employed a diverse dataset consisting of sample patches from three different regions (A, B, and C) in the spectral input data analysis (Neves et al.). This allowed the model to learn from a wide range of variations in the data, thereby improving its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

Secondly, the study used a cross-validation approach to train and validate the deep learning model. Specifically, the complete sample set was randomly split into training and validation sets, with 70% and 30% of the samples assigned to each set, respectively. This process was repeated three times, with each region serving as the testing region in turn. The use of cross-validation helps to reduce overfitting and ensures that the model's performance is not overestimated.

Thirdly, the study employed data augmentation techniques to increase the size and diversity of the training and validation sets. Specifically, six data augmentation techniques were applied to the remaining training and validation samples, which excluded any samples containing no-data values. This helped to increase the number of samples available for training and validation, and also introduced additional variability into the data, which further improved the model's ability to generalize.

Finally, the sliding window approach was used to generate samples for the semantic segmentation process. This approach allowed for the generation of samples with different sizes and shapes, which helped to ensure that the model was exposed to a wide range of variations in the data.

In summary, the study ensured the generalizability of the deep learning model through the use of a diverse dataset, cross-validation, data augmentation techniques, and the sliding window approach. These measures helped to reduce overfitting, increase the size and variability of the training and validation sets, and ensure that the model was exposed to a wide range of variations in the data.
