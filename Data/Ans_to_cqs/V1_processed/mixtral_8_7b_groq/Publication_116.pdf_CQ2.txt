The deep learning pipeline used for classifying leaf-scan images into species utilizes image data format as its input. This is evident from the context provided, which describes the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for this task. CNNs are a specialized class of deep learning models primarily designed for processing grid-like data, such as images.

The initial layer of a CNN typically receives 2D image data in the form of pixels, with multiple channels representing different color components (e.g., RGB images have three channels). As the data progresses through the CNN, feature extraction and transformation operations are performed on the image data, such as convolution, pooling, normalization, and non-linear activation functions. These processes help the network learn and extract relevant features from the raw pixel data for the task at hand, such as image classification.

Furthermore, the context does not mention any other data formats, such as audio, video, or CSV, being used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is safe to conclude that the deep learning pipeline for classifying leaf-scan images into species relies solely on image data format.
