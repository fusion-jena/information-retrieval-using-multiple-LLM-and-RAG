The provided context does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. The text focuses on the use of pre-trained ImageNet weights, fine-tuning, and Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter selection. It mentions several studies that used GoogleNet, Inception-V3, and Inception-ResNet-v2 architectures for plant species classification, but it does not specify the hardware used for training these models. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models.
