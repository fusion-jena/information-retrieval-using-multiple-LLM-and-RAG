The provided context does not give specific information on how the hyperparameters of the model used in the study are optimized. Hyperparameter optimization is an essential step in training machine learning models, as it can significantly impact the model's performance.

Common methods for hyperparameter optimization include grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization. Grid search involves testing all possible combinations of hyperparameters within a specified range, while random search selects a subset of combinations at random. Bayesian optimization, on the other hand, uses a probabilistic approach to select the most promising hyperparameters to test.

Without specific information on how the hyperparameters were optimized in this study, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer. However, it is mentioned that the recognition system is based on Faster R-CNN, a popular deep learning model for object detection and classification. It is possible that the hyperparameters of the Faster R-CNN model were optimized using one of the methods mentioned above or another optimization technique.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific information on how the hyperparameters of the model used in the study were optimized, it is mentioned that the recognition system is based on Faster R-CNN, and hyperparameter optimization is a common and important step in training machine learning models.
