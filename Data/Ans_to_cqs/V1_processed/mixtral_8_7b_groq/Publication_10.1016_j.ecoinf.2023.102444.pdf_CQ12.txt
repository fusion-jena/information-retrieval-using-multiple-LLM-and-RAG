Based on the provided context, a specific type of deep learning model is not explicitly mentioned in the application of UMAP to estimate species distribution. The focus of the study is on using UMAP for dimensionality reduction and species distribution modeling, rather than applying a particular deep learning model such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer.

However, the context does mention a study by Deneu et al. (2022) that used tSNE, another dimensionality reduction method, to visualize input data and the results of applying a convolutional neural network (CNN) to model species distribution at a fine resolution. This suggests that CNNs can be used in the broader context of species distribution modeling based on remote sensing imagery.

In summary, while the specific deep learning model used in the UMAP-based species distribution modeling is not specified in the provided context, CNNs have been used in related studies for this purpose.
