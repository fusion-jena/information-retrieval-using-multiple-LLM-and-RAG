The context provided does not give specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the data used in the study was provided as part of the EarthNet2021 Challenge and consists of 23,904 training datacubes located across Europe. These datacubes contain topography information used as model inputs for past and present time steps and guide predictions for future time steps. The datacubes are divided between a set used for model training and four distinct sets for testing, as defined by EarthNet2021.

Furthermore, the study uses Sentinel-2 data, which are Earth observation data provided by the European Space Agency. Sentinel-2 provides high-resolution optical imagery that can be used to monitor vegetation and other land cover types. The study also uses the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which is a commonly used indicator of vegetation health and can be derived from remote sensing data.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data, it can be inferred that the data was collected through Earth observation satellites, specifically Sentinel-2, and possibly through other remote sensing techniques. Additionally, the data may have been obtained through participation in the EarthNet2021 Challenge, which likely has its own data collection procedures. However, the specific details of these procedures are not provided in the context.
