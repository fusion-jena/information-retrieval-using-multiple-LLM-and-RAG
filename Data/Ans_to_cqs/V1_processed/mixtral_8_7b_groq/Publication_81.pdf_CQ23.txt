The generalizability of the deep learning model for fish classification from DNA barcode sequences was addressed through the use of the Elastic Net and the KDE (Kernel Density Estimation) technique. The Elastic Net was introduced to improve the model's generalization ability and overcome the overfitting problem caused by the small dataset due to the limited number of species in the family. The KDE technique was employed for automatic learning of the decision threshold, which is often overlooked in other classification studies. These measures specifically target the issues of limited data and high dimensionality inherent in DNA barcode sequence data. Cross-validation or diverse dataset strategies were not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, so it is unclear if these techniques were also used.
