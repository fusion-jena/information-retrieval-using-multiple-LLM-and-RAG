The context provided does not give specific information about the data augmentation techniques used in a particular deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some papers and datasets that could be used to find this information.

For instance, the Microsoft COCO dataset, mentioned in the paper "Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context" by Lin et al., 2014, is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset. It is likely that this dataset uses various data augmentation techniques during the preprocessing of images. The paper does not explicitly mention which techniques were used, but it is common practice to use techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling in object detection tasks.

The paper "Communication-efficient parallelization strategy for deep convolutional neural network training" by Lee et al., 2018b, discusses a strategy for parallelizing the training of deep convolutional neural networks. While the paper does not explicitly mention data augmentation, it is possible that data augmentation was used during the training process to increase the diversity of the training data and reduce overfitting.

The paper "Wild animal detection from highly cluttered images using deep convolutional neural network" by Verma and Gupta, 2018, discusses a deep convolutional neural network for detecting wild animals in images. The paper does not mention data augmentation explicitly, but it is likely that techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling were used during the preprocessing of images to increase the size and diversity of the training data.

The paper "Deep residual convolutional neural network based on YOLOv5" by Liu et al., 2023a, presents a deep residual convolutional neural network based on the YOLOv5 object detection model. While the paper does not explicitly mention data augmentation, it is common practice to use techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling during the preprocessing of images for object detection tasks.

In summary, while the context provided does not give specific information about the data augmentation techniques used in a particular deep learning pipeline, it is likely that techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling were used during the preprocessing of images for object detection tasks.
