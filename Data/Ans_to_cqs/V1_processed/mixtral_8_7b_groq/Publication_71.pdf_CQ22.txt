The specific metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in the given context is overall accuracy. Overall accuracy is a measure of the proportion of correct predictions made by the model out of all the predictions made. It is calculated as the number of correct predictions divided by the total number of predictions.

In the first part of the context, it is mentioned that the average overall accuracy for the CNN model reached 0.8298. This indicates that the model was able to correctly classify 82.98% of the total number of images it was trained on.

In the second part of the context, the performance of the model is evaluated using the same metric of overall accuracy. The average overall accuracy for the CNN model reached 0.8298, which is the same value as in the first part of the context. This indicates that the model's performance did not improve or degrade when trained using a sequential approach on the four quadrants of the Vasiliko dataset.

It is worth noting that other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score are not mentioned in the given context. These metrics are commonly used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models, especially in cases where the class distribution is imbalanced. However, in this case, overall accuracy was used as the sole metric to evaluate the model's performance.
