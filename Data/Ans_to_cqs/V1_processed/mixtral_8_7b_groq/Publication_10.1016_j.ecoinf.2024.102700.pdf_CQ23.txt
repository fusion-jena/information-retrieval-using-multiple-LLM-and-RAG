Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that various modeling approaches have been applied, and model validation was carried out either in addition to internal validation strategies or as the sole validation method.

In the context of model validation, the study mentions the use of an explicit validation method in 39 out of 113 studies, while 94 studies did not provide information on the validation method used. Therefore, it is unclear if cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other techniques were used to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model.

Moreover, the study focuses on the eligibility criteria concerning research questions, including the population, modeling approach, environmental variables, temporal and spatial resolution, validation method, metrics, and main output. However, it does not explicitly mention any measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a clear answer to the query regarding the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
