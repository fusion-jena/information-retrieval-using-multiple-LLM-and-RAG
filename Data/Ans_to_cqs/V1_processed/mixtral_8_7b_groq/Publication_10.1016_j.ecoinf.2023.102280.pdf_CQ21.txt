Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training for noise reduction and deep audio enhancement in bioacoustics applications. However, it can be inferred that some form of metrics calculation is likely performed to evaluate the model's performance.

In the given Figure 1, it shows a diagram of the methodology pipeline, which includes the validation data set (denoted as ~S), noise reduction and deep audio enhancement models, and denoised outputs (denoted as ~Sdenoised). It can be inferred that the denoised outputs are compared with the original validation data set (~S) to assess the model's ability to reduce noise and enhance audio quality.

Moreover, the context mentions that data requirements are a key consideration for many monitoring applications, and data augmentation techniques such as superimposing noise samples should be considered. This suggests that some form of data manipulation or processing is carried out during the training phase, but it does not specifically mention any postprocessing steps.

In Section 5.2, the context discusses ablation studies, which involve removing or altering certain components of a system to observe the effect on performance. While this is not a postprocessing step per se, it is a technique that can be used to gain insights into the model's behavior and identify areas for improvement.

Therefore, while the provided context does not give a clear answer to the query, it can be inferred that some form of metrics calculation is likely performed to evaluate the model's performance after training. However, specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrices are not mentioned.
