The provided context discusses an experiment conducted on WT-HMM (Wavelet Transform-Hidden Markov Model) for classifying calls and other sounds, focusing on the effect of varying dataset sizes. However, the text does not provide information on the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I cannot answer the query based on the given context.
