The data repository for the deep learning pipeline is Whiskerbook.org. This website is mentioned in the context as the platform where the largest fully labeled snow leopard dataset for deep learning research has been contributed. It is expected that the novel deep learning methods used in this study will encourage other academics to contribute more datasets to this website. Therefore, Whiskerbook.org can be considered as the data repository for the deep learning pipeline.
