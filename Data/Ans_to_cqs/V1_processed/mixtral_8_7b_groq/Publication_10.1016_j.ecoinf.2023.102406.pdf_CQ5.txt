Based on the provided context, the datasets used in the study are not explicitly mentioned as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, which are commonly used in deep learning research related to image classification. Instead, this study focuses on ecological informatics and uses climatology data provided by CHELSA-TraCE21k v1.0 for the North American continent during 1900-1990. The variables include annual mean temperature, maximum temperature in the warmest month, minimum temperature in the coldest month, temperature in the wettest and driest quarters, and annual precipitation, along with its distribution across different months and quarters.

The study uses these climate variables as input features for the deep learning models and analyzes their importance in predicting species distribution. The focus is on understanding the relationship between climate variables and species distribution rather than benchmarking deep learning models using standard image classification datasets.

In summary, the datasets used in this study are climatology data provided by CHELSA-TraCE21k v1.0 for the North American continent during 1900-1990, and not MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
