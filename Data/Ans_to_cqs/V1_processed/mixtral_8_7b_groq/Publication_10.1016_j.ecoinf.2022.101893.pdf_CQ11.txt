I'm sorry for any inconvenience, but the provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the design of a deep learning network for bird species recognition, feature selection methods, and the use of different transforms and convolutional neural networks (CNN) for feature extraction. However, it does not mention where the data used in this pipeline can be found or accessed.
