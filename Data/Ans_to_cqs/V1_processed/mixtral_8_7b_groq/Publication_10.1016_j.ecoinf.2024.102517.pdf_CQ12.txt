The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly specified in the given context. However, it is mentioned that the model is based on Tensorflow, a popular open-source platform for machine learning and artificial intelligence, and uses a GPU for training. The model is also described as a "deep feature loss bird sound noise reduction network," which suggests that it is a custom network designed for reducing noise in bird sounds.

The network is trained for 50 epochs using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 10. In each epoch, the entire training set is presented in a random order, with one noisy bird sound signal per iteration. The network is compared with several other bioacoustics noise reduction algorithms, including SEGAN, WebRTC, wavelet transform, Wiener filter, and MMSE STSA algorithms.

Based on the given context, it can be inferred that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a custom network designed for bird sound noise reduction, and it is likely to be a convolutional neural network (CNN) or a fully convolutional neural network (FCN) since these types of networks are commonly used for image and signal processing tasks. However, the exact architecture and details of the network are not provided in the given context.
