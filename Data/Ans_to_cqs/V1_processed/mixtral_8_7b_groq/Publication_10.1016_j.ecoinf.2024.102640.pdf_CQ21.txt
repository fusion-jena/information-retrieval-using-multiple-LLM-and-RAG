Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training in GreenCam. However, it does mention the use of certain metrics during the training of the EPDNet model for learning eye-phone distance.

The EPDNet model uses the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function during training, and the R2 metric is used to assess the model's fit to the observed data. The R2 metric, also known as the coefficient of determination, is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance for a dependent variable that's explained by an independent variable or variables in a regression model.

However, there is no mention of other postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrix. Saliency maps are often used in computer vision tasks to highlight the important regions of an image, but there is no indication that GreenCam uses saliency maps as part of its postprocessing. Similarly, a confusion matrix is a table used to describe the performance of a classification model, but there is no mention of a confusion matrix being used in the context of GreenCam.

In summary, while the context provides information about the metrics used during the training of the EPDNet model, there is no explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training in GreenCam.
