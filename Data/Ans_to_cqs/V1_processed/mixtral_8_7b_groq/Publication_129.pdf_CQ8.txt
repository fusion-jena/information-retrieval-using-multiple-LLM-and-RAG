I regret to inform you that the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study titled "A new mobile application of agricultural pests recognition using deep learning in cloud computing system" is not available in sources such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. The information provided in the given context focuses on the performance utilization of the RPN module with bounding box regression and the computational time of the deep learning approach. It also mentions the specific studies and conferences related to the development of the deep learning model for agricultural pest recognition. However, it does not include details about the code repository.

For a better understanding of the topics discussed in the given context, you can refer to the following resources:

1. For Flask Web Development using Python: Flask Web Development: Developing Web Applications with Python by M. Grinberg (2018) - [37]
2. For database programming with PHP/MySQL: A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO Data-base Programming with PHP/MySQL by V. Siahaan, R.H. Sianipar (2019) - [38]
3. For mastering OpenCV 4 with Python: Mastering OpenCV 4 with Python: A practical guide covering topics from image processing, augmented reality to deep learning with OpenCV 4 and Python 3.7 by A.F. VillaÂ´ n (2019) - [39]
4. For the Inception Architecture for Computer Vision: Rethinking the Inception Architecture for Computer Vision by C. Szegedy, V. Vanhoucke, S. Ioffe, J. Shlens, Z. Wojna (2016) - [40]

These resources will help you understand the concepts and techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for agricultural pest recognition. Nonetheless, I was unable to locate the code repository for the specific pipeline used in the study.
