The postprocessing steps involved after the model training for biomass estimation can include various methods such as generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, and creating confusion matrices. However, based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of these specific postprocessing steps.

In the context, the study focuses on developing a method for biomass estimation using forest inventory data and remote sensing imagery. The authors mention the importance of high-quality training samples for constructing accurate and reliable models. They also cite a study by Bortolot and Wynne (2005) that uses an individual tree-based approach for estimating forest biomass using small footprint LiDAR data.

However, the postprocessing steps after model training are not discussed in detail. Therefore, we cannot provide a specific answer based on the given context.

In general, saliency maps can be used to visualize the regions of the input data that have the most influence on the model's output. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score can be calculated to evaluate the performance of the model. A confusion matrix can be created to assess the performance of the model by comparing the predicted values with the actual values.

In summary, while postprocessing steps such as generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, and creating confusion matrices are commonly used in machine learning applications, the provided context does not mention these specific steps in the postprocessing of the biomass estimation model.
