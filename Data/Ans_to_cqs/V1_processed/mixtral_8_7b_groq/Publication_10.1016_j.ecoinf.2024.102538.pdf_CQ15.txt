The deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context uses the Adam optimization technique. The Adam optimizer, proposed by Kingma and Ba in 2015, is a popular optimization algorithm for training neural networks. It combines the advantages of two other optimization methods, AdaGrad and RMSProp, by using the estimated first moment (the running average of gradient) and the second moment (the decaying average of squared gradient) to update the weights.

In the described context, the model was trained over 200 epochs using the Adam optimizer. The batch size was fixed at 16. The learning rate was initially set at 0.001 and was subsequently reduced by a factor of 0.1 in a step-wise manner whenever the validation loss remained constant for five epochs. The minimum learning rate was not specified in the context.

It is worth noting that the choice of optimization technique can significantly impact the training process and the final performance of the model. Adam has been found to be efficient in many deep learning applications due to its adaptive learning rate and ability to handle sparse gradients. However, other optimization techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and its variants (e.g., Momentum SGD, Nesterov Accelerated Gradient) can also be suitable depending on the specific problem and dataset characteristics.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline discussed in the context uses the Adam optimization algorithm for training the model. This choice is based on the advantages of Adam, such as adaptive learning rates and efficient handling of sparse gradients. However, other optimization techniques like SGD and its variants can also be considered for different applications.
