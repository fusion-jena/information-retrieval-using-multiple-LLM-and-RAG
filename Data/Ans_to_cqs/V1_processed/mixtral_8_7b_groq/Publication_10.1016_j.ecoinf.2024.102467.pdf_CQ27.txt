The text provided does not give specific details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that an efficient, lightweight feature extraction network called EfficientnetV2 was used to improve the training speed and accuracy of a model for detecting benthic organisms in aquaculture.

The creators of EfficientnetV2 focused on optimizing the accuracy, parameter count, and computational requirements of the model, and then further reduced the number of parameters and computations in the EfficientnetV2 series while preserving the accuracy of the model. They also used an improved progressive learning approach that dynamically adjusts the regularization method based on the training image size.

Based on this network, a backbone was designed to improve the training speed of the model while ensuring detection accuracy and speed. The model was then trained on a benthic organism dataset and achieved a higher detection accuracy compared to the original Faster R-CNN algorithm.

While the text does not provide specific information on model serialization or platform selection, it can be inferred that the model was likely serialized in a format that could be easily deployed on a chosen platform. The platform selection would depend on the specific requirements of the application, such as computational resources, real-time performance, and integration with other systems. Common platforms for deploying deep learning models include cloud services, edge devices, and custom hardware accelerators.
