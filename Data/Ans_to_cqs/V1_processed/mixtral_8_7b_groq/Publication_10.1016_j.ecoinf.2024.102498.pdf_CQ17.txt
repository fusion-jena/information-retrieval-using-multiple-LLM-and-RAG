The provided context discusses the methods used to prevent overfitting in pixel-based classification approaches and not deep learning techniques. However, I will provide some information on regularization methods used in deep learning to answer the query.

In deep learning, particularly in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), regularization techniques are employed to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise, and performs poorly on unseen data. Regularization methods help reduce overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages the learning of overly complex models.

Two common regularization techniques used in deep learning are L2 regularization and dropout.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the model's weights to the loss function. This penalty term encourages smaller weights, reducing the complexity of the model and preventing overfitting.

Dropout is another regularization technique that stochastically sets a fraction of a layer's outputs to zero during training. This process prevents the co-adaptation of feature detectors, forcing the model to learn more robust features. As a result, dropout improves the model's generalization performance and reduces overfitting.

The context discusses the use of the Gradient Boosting Trees (GBT) algorithm, which is an ensemble method that builds trees sequentially, with each tree attempting to correct the weakness of the previous tree. GBT uses a form of regularization called shrinkage, which scales the contribution of each tree by a factor called the learning rate. This learning rate controls the addition of new trees, preventing overfitting by limiting the complexity of the model.

In summary, L2 regularization and dropout are two common regularization techniques used in deep learning to prevent overfitting. L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function that encourages smaller weights, while dropout stochastically sets a fraction of a layer's outputs to zero during training, preventing the co-adaptation of feature detectors. The context discusses the use of shrinkage in GBT as a form of regularization that limits the complexity of the model and prevents overfitting.
