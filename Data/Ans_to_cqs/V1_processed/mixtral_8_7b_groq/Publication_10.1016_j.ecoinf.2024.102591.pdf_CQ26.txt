The provided context discusses the use of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) for retrieving the Fraction of Canopy Cover (FCOVER) from post-fire Sentinel-2 (S2) scenes using the PROSAIL-D Radiative Transfer Model (RTM) and Random Forest (RF) regression algorithm. However, it does not directly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline.

In general, data bias can be addressed during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline using techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets based on certain criteria, such as class labels, to ensure that each subset contains a representative sample of the data. This can help prevent bias in the training, validation, and testing datasets.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to balance the class distribution in a dataset. Oversampling involves increasing the number of instances in the minority class, while undersampling involves decreasing the number of instances in the majority class.

Diverse data collection involves gathering data from various sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population being studied. This can help prevent bias in the dataset and improve the performance of the deep learning model.

In the context of the FCOVER retrieval from post-fire S2 scenes, data bias could arise due to factors such as cloud cover, topography, and sensor limitations. To address these issues, the authors use S2 Level-2A scenes, which minimize the issue of cloud masking but may feature topography overcorrection in mountain areas. They also use individual S2 bands instead of broadband spectral indices to discriminate the burned signal.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of the above techniques to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, it is possible that they were employed in the data preprocessing stage. However, further information would be needed to confirm this.
