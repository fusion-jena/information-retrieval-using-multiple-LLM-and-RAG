Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, I can provide some general guidance on data splitting criteria that are commonly used in deep learning.

Data splitting is an essential step in the development of deep learning models. It involves dividing the dataset into different subsets to train, validate, and test the model. The choice of data splitting criteria can significantly impact the model's performance and generalization ability.

Here are some common data splitting criteria used in deep learning:

1. Random splitting: In this method, the dataset is randomly divided into training, validation, and testing sets. This approach ensures that the data is evenly distributed and provides a good representation of the entire dataset. It is a simple and widely used method for data splitting.
2. Time-series splitting: In time-series data, it is essential to maintain the temporal order of the data. Therefore, the dataset is split based on time, where the training set consists of earlier data points, and the validation and testing sets consist of later data points. This approach ensures that the model is trained on past data and tested on future data, which is a more realistic scenario.
3. Stratified splitting: In some cases, the dataset may be imbalanced, where one class has significantly more samples than the other classes. In such cases, stratified splitting is used to ensure that each subset has a similar distribution of classes. This approach helps to prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.
4. K-fold cross-validation: In this method, the dataset is divided into k folds, where each fold is used as a validation set, and the remaining k-1 folds are used as the training set. This process is repeated k times, and the average performance is calculated. K-fold cross-validation helps to reduce the variance of the model's performance and provides a more reliable estimate of its generalization ability.

In summary, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used for data splitting in deep learning models. However, some common data splitting criteria include random splitting, time-series splitting, stratified splitting, and k-fold cross-validation. The choice of data splitting criteria depends on the dataset and the problem at hand.
