Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved to enhance the quality and compatibility of the data. These steps can include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. However, the provided context does not explicitly mention these steps in relation to training a deep learning model for camera trap data.

Normalization and scaling are common preprocessing techniques used to adjust the range and distribution of input features. This can help improve the model's performance and convergence during training. For instance, the Image Filtering and Labelling Assistant (IFLA) tool (Xi et al., 2021) may incorporate normalization or scaling techniques as part of its image filtering process.

Cleaning the data involves removing or correcting erroneous, missing, or irrelevant information. In the context of camera trap data, this could mean identifying and handling empty images, as done by the Zilong tool (Wei et al., 2020). Additionally, tools like IFLA (Xi et al., 2021) can expedite the analysis of camera trap data by assisting with image labeling, which can be considered part of the data cleaning process.

The context does mention the use of machine learning and deep learning techniques to reduce the amount of useless data collected by camera traps. For example, Schindler and Steinhage (2021) use a combination of Mask R-CNN with Flow-Guided Feature Aggregation to optimize instance segmentation of animal species in video clips. While not explicitly stated, it is likely that these researchers also employ preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, and cleaning to enhance their model's performance.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps of normalization, scaling, and cleaning in the training of deep learning models for camera trap data, it is highly probable that these steps are incorporated into the data preprocessing pipeline.
