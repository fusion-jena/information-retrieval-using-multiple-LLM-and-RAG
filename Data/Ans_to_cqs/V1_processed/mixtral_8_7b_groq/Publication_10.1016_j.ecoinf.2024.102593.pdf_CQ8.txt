Unfortunately, there is no information provided in the context about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context includes references to several papers and resources related to the BirdNET-Analyzer v2.1 models, CNN codes, and bird sound projects, but it does not mention where the code for the deep learning pipeline is available. It is possible that the code has not been made publicly available, or it may be hosted on a platform other than GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
