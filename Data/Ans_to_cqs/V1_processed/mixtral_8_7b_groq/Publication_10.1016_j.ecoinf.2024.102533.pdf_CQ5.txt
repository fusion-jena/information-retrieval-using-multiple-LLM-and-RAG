Based on the provided context, there are no specific datasets mentioned in relation to a deep learning pipeline. The context mainly discusses a study about data normalization and its impact on the performance of machine learning algorithms.

However, the authors do mention some datasets in the references, which could potentially be used in a deep learning pipeline. These datasets include MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet, which are commonly used in deep learning research.

MNIST is a dataset of handwritten digits that is often used as a starting point for image recognition tasks. It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each of which is a 28x28 grayscale image of a digit from 0 to 9.

CIFAR-10 is a dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. The classes include airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks.

ImageNet is a large-scale dataset of over 14 million images, with 1,000 images per class and 100,000 classes in total. It is often used for object recognition and image classification tasks.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of these datasets in a deep learning pipeline, they are commonly used in deep learning research and could potentially be used in the pipeline discussed in the study.
