Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide some insights into possible techniques that could be used based on related concepts and methods mentioned in the texts.

1. Stratified splitting: Although not explicitly mentioned, stratified sampling can be an essential technique for addressing data bias. Stratified sampling ensures that the training and testing datasets have a similar distribution of important variables or classes. This method can help prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class or overfitting to specific patterns present in the training data.

2. Oversampling and undersampling: The context discusses the use of the caret package (Khun, 2022), which provides functions for balancing class distributions in datasets. Oversampling is a technique that increases the frequency of the minority class, while undersampling reduces the frequency of the majority class. Balancing class distributions can help improve model performance and reduce bias.

3. Diverse data collection: The context highlights the use of various data sources, such as WorldPop (2017), TerraClimate (Abatzoglou et al., 2018), CHIRPS (Funk et al., 2015), and MODIS. Integrating multiple data sources can help increase data diversity and reduce bias by capturing a wider range of patterns and relationships in the data.

4. Feature elimination techniques: The context discusses two feature elimination techniques, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Variable Selection Using Random Forests (VSURF). These techniques can help address data bias by reducing the dimensionality of the dataset and retaining only the most important features for predicting the response variable. This process can help prevent overfitting and improve model generalization.

5. Gutzwiller and Serno (2023), Muckley et al. (2023), and Meyer and Pebesma (2021) are cited in the context, but their specific methods for addressing data bias are not provided. However, creating a mask to delineate the "area of applicability" for a trained model (Meyer and Pebesma, 2021) can help ensure that the model is applied to regions with sufficient training data, reducing bias and uncertainty in predictions.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly mention techniques for addressing data bias during deep learning preprocessing, it does discuss related methods such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, diverse data collection, feature elimination techniques, and creating a mask for the area of applicability. These techniques can help reduce data bias and improve model performance.
