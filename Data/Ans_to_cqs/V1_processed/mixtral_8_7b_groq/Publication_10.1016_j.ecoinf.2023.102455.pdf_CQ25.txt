The deep learning model in question appears to be designed for the purpose of time series forecasting, specifically for predicting daily streamflow (Qflow). This is evident from the use of various models such as CNN-BiGRU, CNN-BiRNN, KELM, and RVFL, which are used to create a multi-temporal forecasting model.

The model seems to be a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) or Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (BiRNN). CNN is used for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction, while GRU/BiRNN is used for handling sequential data.

The model's performance is evaluated based on three metrics: R (coefficient of determination), RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), and MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error). These metrics are commonly used for evaluating the performance of regression models.

The model's architecture includes two CNN layers with 64 filters and a kernel size of [1,4], followed by either GRU or BiRNN layers with 30 neurons. The optimizer used is Adam, and the activation function is 'relu'. The model is trained for a certain number of epochs, with a batch size of 32 and a learning rate of 0.0001.

The hyperparameters of the model, such as the number of layers, filters, neurons, learning rate, and regularization coefficient, have been tuned using either metaheuristic optimization algorithms or cross-validation schemes.

In summary, the deep learning model in question is designed for time series forecasting, specifically for predicting daily streamflow. The model combines CNN and GRU/BiRNN architectures and is evaluated based on R, RMSE, and MAPE metrics. The model's hyperparameters have been optimized using metaheuristic algorithms or cross-validation schemes.
