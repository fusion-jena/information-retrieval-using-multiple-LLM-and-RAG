Based on the provided context, the query seems to be asking about datasets used in a deep learning pipeline in the context of a specific study related to environmental, climatic, soil, topographic, and anthropogenic factors. However, the context does not provide any information about the use of standard deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.

In the given study, various datasets were used for different purposes. For example, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) was used as a source for climatic variables such as maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation. OpenLandMap Soil Water Content, OpenLandMap Soil Organic Carbon Content, and OpenLandMap Soil pH in H2O were used for soil variables such as soil water content, soil organic carbon content, and soil pH. GTOPO30 was used for topographic variables such as elevation, slope, and aspect. Gridded Population of World Version 4 (GPWv4) was used for anthropogenic variables such as human population density.

Additionally, the study also used native and alien species pools for ecological variables. The specimens of native species and alien species were separated, and only the specimens of those alien species that belonged to the categories of cultivated, casual, naturalised, and invasive were considered.

Therefore, the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline of this specific study are related to environmental, climatic, soil, topographic, and anthropogenic factors, as well as ecological variables such as native and alien species. However, the context does not provide any information about the use of standard deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
