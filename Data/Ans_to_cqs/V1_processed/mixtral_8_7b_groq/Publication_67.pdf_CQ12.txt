The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the context provided, which mentions the use of the Inception v.3 architecture, which is a well-known CNN model. The pipeline involves constructing a database of high-resolution satellite and aerial images, training five CNN models based on Inception v.3 using transfer learning and data augmentation, classifying new images with different tree cover using the built CNN-based model, and assessing the performance of the model on the new images. There is no mention of other types of deep learning models such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers in the context.
