Deep learning models typically demand specific hardware resources, including Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), for their training process. These specialized hardware components facilitate the computationally intensive calculations required by deep learning algorithms (Jafarzadeh et al., 2022).

Deep learning models consist of interconnected layers of artificial neural networks, which require substantial computational power to optimize the weights and biases during the training phase. Conventional Central Processing Units (CPUs) may not provide the necessary processing capabilities, making GPUs and TPUs popular choices for deep learning applications (Wu et al., 2021).

GPUs are well-suited for deep learning tasks due to their ability to perform parallel processing, enabling them to handle multiple calculations simultaneously. This characteristic is particularly beneficial for matrix and vector operations, which are fundamental to deep learning computations (Joshi et al., 2023).

On the other hand, TPUs are custom-built Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) developed by Google for machine learning tasks. TPUs are designed to accelerate tensor operations, providing an efficient and optimized solution for deep learning model training (Wu et al., 2023).

In summary, deep learning models typically require GPUs or TPUs for training due to their computational demands. These hardware resources, such as GPUs and TPUs, offer the necessary processing power and efficiency to handle the complex calculations involved in deep learning model training.
