The provided context does not give specific information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of certain models and techniques that can provide some insight.

The context mentions the use of VGG16, ResNet152-V2, VGGish, YAMNet, and BirdNet models. VGG16 and ResNet152-V2 are models that were developed for image classification tasks, while VGGish, YAMNet, and BirdNet are models that were developed for audio classification tasks. Regularization methods used in these models can vary, but common methods include dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly sets a fraction rate of input units to 0 at each update during training time, which helps prevent overfitting (Srivastava et al., 2014). L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is a method that penalizes large weights in the model by adding a term to the loss function that is proportional to the sum of the squares of the weights (Hoerl and Kennard, 1970).

In the context, it is mentioned that the authors used entropy loss or custom loss functions, but it is not specified if any regularization methods were used along with these loss functions. It is also mentioned that the authors used pre-trained models, which can help prevent overfitting by providing a good initial set of weights.

In addition, the authors mentioned that they used a small validation set, which can make it difficult to detect overfitting. In such cases, regularization methods become even more important to prevent overfitting.

Therefore, while the context does not provide specific information about the regularization methods used, it can be inferred that regularization methods such as dropout and L2 regularization could have been used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
