The provided context does not give specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model for species identification. The focus of the text is on the application of neural networks in camera trap data analysis, with an emphasis on reducing power consumption and training the network for user-selected species sets.

However, it does mention the use of a neural network model called Scaled-YOLOv4 (Wang et al., 2021) and a Multilayer Perceptron model (Si et al., 2020). For Scaled-YOLOv4, the original paper (Wang et al., 2021) mentions that it utilizes a learning rate of 0.01, a momentum of 0.937, and a weight decay of 0.0005. The paper also mentions that it uses the Adam optimizer.

As for the Multilayer Perceptron model implemented on an FPGA (Si et al., 2020), the context does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used. It is also important to note that the performance of a neural network model is not solely determined by its hyperparameters but also by its architecture, the quality of the training data, and the preprocessing steps applied to the input data.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model for species identification, it does mention the use of Scaled-YOLOv4 and a Multilayer Perceptron model. The original paper for Scaled-YOLOv4 provides details about its hyperparameters, but the context does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in the Multilayer Perceptron model.
