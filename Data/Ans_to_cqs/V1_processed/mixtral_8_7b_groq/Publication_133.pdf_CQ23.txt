The text provided does not give a detailed description of the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention some steps that were taken during the training of the model which can indirectly contribute to the model's generalizability.

Firstly, the model was trained using a deep learning approach where it iteratively generated learning predictions of the training set samples, evaluated them by the loss function, and modified their parameters according to the loss functionâ€™s gradient. This process was repeated for 30 epochs per training task. This method of training can help the model to learn a wide range of features from the training data, which can improve its ability to generalize to new data.

Secondly, the text mentions that the data used for training the model varied in format and reliability as they originated from multiple sources. This diverse dataset can help the model to learn a variety of features and patterns, which can improve its ability to generalize to new data.

Lastly, the text mentions that the validation data were set aside while training and their annotations by the models were monitored. The validation data helped to limit overfitting, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting. This can also contribute to the model's generalizability.

However, the text does not explicitly mention other common techniques used to ensure the generalizability of deep learning models, such as cross-validation, stratified splitting, or data augmentation. Therefore, it is unclear if these techniques were used during the training of the model.
