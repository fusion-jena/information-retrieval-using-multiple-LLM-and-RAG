The provided context does not give specific details about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. However, it is common practice in deep learning to use Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to accelerate the training process. GPUs are well-suited for parallel computations, which is beneficial for the matrix and vector operations that are prevalent in deep learning algorithms. Therefore, it is likely that GPUs were used for training the deep learning models in the study. However, without explicit information, it is not possible to give a definitive answer.
