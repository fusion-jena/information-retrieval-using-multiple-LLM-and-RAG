Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The text discusses the creation of a thorough time series dataset in mainland China using Google Earth Engine (GEE), which includes land cover types, wildfire locations, Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), and above-ground biomass data. However, it does not mention any steps taken to validate or generalize a deep learning model.

The processes described include filtering a feature collection by fire occurrence date, extracting land cover types, calculating annual Net Primary Production (NPP), and creating a "ForestFireArea" image collection. These steps are necessary for preparing and analyzing the data, but they do not directly address the generalizability of a deep learning model.

To ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, several measures can be taken, such as creating a diverse dataset, using cross-validation, and implementing stratified splitting. A diverse dataset can be created by including various data sources, regions, and conditions. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into multiple subsets and training the model on different combinations of these subsets to assess its performance. Stratified splitting ensures that each subset contains a representative sample of all classes in the dataset, preventing bias in the model's performance.

Without more information about the deep learning model and its application, it is difficult to provide a specific answer to the query. However, based on the provided context, no measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model have been mentioned.
