Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, or creating a confusion matrix. However, it is mentioned that the model was trained using a dataset of 2,812 annotated clips containing 4,782 individual search-phase echolocation call annotations from Romania and Bulgaria. These annotations were used to train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for detecting bat calls.

The performance of the model could be evaluated using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. A confusion matrix could also be created to provide a more detailed analysis of the model's performance. However, the context does not explicitly mention any of these postprocessing steps.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to the query.
