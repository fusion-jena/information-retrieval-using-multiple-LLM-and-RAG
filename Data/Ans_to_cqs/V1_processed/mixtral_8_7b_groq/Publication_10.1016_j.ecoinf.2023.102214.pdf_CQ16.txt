The criteria used to determine when training is complete in the context provided is not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred that the training process is stopped when the model's performance on held-out test data starts to degrade after a certain number of epochs, despite continuing to fit the training data. This suggests that the model has begun to overfit, meaning it has started to memorize the training data rather than learning a generalized matching strategy. 

In machine learning, a common practice to prevent overfitting is to monitor the model's performance on a validation set during the training process. The training process is typically stopped when the validation loss plateaus or starts to increase, even if the training loss continues to decrease. This is because the validation set provides an unbiased estimate of the model's performance on unseen data, and a model that performs well on the validation set is more likely to generalize well to new data. 

However, in the provided context, it seems that the validation loss is not explicitly used as a stopping criterion. Instead, the training process is stopped based on the model's performance on the test set after a certain number of epochs. This approach may still be effective in preventing overfitting, as long as the test set is large and representative of the overall data distribution. However, it may also lead to underfitting if the model is stopped too early, before it has had a chance to learn the underlying patterns in the data. 

In summary, while the specific criterion used to determine when training is complete is not explicitly stated in the provided context, it can be inferred that the training process is stopped based on the model's performance on held-out test data after a certain number of epochs. This approach may be effective in preventing overfitting, but it may also lead to underfitting if the model is stopped too early.
