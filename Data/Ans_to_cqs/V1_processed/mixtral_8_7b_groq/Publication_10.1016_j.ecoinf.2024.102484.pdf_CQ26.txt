The provided context does not directly discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of stratified splitting in the context of land degradation assessment. Stratified sampling is a method that can help reduce data bias by ensuring that the sample is representative of the entire population. In this case, it is used to ensure that the sample units are representative of the different levels of soil degradation in the study region.

Additionally, the context also mentions the importance of diverse data collection in the context of monitoring ecosystem service change. Diverse data collection can help reduce data bias by ensuring that the data used in the deep learning pipeline is representative of the different factors that can influence the outcome.

Other techniques that can be used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline include oversampling and undersampling. Oversampling is a method that can be used to increase the number of examples in a minority class, while undersampling is a method that can be used to decrease the number of examples in a majority class. Both of these methods can help reduce data bias by ensuring that the sample is representative of the entire population.

In summary, the provided context mentions the use of stratified splitting and diverse data collection as methods that can help reduce data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. Other techniques that can be used include oversampling and undersampling. It is important to note that the context does not provide a detailed explanation of these techniques and their implementation.
