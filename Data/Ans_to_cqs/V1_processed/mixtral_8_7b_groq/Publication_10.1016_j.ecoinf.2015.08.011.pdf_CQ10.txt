I regret to inform you that the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline for predicting mosquito abundances in urban areas is not provided in the given context. The article by Keun Young Lee, Namil Chung, and Suntae Hwang discusses the application of an artificial neural network (ANN) model for predicting mosquito abundances using various environmental factors. However, there is no mention of a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in this study.

The authors do mention that they used the "neural network toolbox" in MATLAB for developing the ANN model, but they do not provide the specific code or repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide you with the requested information. I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.
