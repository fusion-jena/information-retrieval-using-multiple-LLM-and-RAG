In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention optimization techniques like SGD or Adam, it does mention the use of a Bayesian optimizer during the data augmentation process. Additionally, the SCAM module implements four pooling operations that likely involve their own optimization processes. However, the specific optimization techniques used in the described DL model for medicinal plant identification are not explicitly mentioned.
