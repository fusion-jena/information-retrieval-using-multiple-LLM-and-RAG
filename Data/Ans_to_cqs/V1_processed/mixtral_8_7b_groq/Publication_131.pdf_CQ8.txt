Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context describes the structure of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for sound classification and the cyber-physical system (CPS) used for training and deploying the CNN. However, it does not mention where the code for this pipeline is hosted. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
