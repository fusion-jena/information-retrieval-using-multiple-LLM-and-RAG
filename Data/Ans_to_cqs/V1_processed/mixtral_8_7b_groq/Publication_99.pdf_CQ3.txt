Based on the provided context, the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned. However, we can infer that some form of image annotation was used in the training of the Pix2Pix networks, as they are a type of generative adversarial network (GAN) that learns to map an input image to a corresponding output image. In the context of reconstructing damaged herbarium leaves, the input image would be a damaged leaf, and the output image would be a reconstructed version of the same leaf.

Pix2Pix networks use a type of loss function called a per-pixel loss, which measures the difference between the pixels of the input and output images. This loss function encourages the network to produce an output image that is similar to the input image at the pixel level. Additionally, Pix2Pix networks may also use a perceptual loss, which measures the difference between high-level features of the input and output images, and a style loss, which measures the difference in the overall style or texture of the images.

However, the specific data annotation technique used to train the Pix2Pix networks in this study is not mentioned. It is possible that the input and output images were manually annotated with corresponding pixel-level labels, or that they were generated synthetically using computer graphics techniques.

In contrast, the classification networks used in the study are trained using a different type of loss function called cross-entropy loss, which is commonly used for image classification tasks. These networks are pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, which contains millions of images with corresponding labels. Therefore, the data annotation technique used for the ImageNet dataset is likely to be labeling at the image level, where each image is assigned a single label corresponding to the object class it belongs to.

In summary, while the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline of this study are not explicitly mentioned, we can infer that some form of image annotation was used for the Pix2Pix networks, and that labeling at the image level was used for the classification networks.
