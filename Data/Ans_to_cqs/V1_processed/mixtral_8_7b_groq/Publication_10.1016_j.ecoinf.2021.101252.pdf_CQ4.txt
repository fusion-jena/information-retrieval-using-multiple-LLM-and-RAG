I'm sorry, but the provided context does not contain information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Flipping, Rotating, or Scaling. The context mainly discusses the use of AutoML for deep learning, case studies comparing different architectures, and the measurement of model performance. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given information.
