The provided pieces of context do not directly discuss the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, they do provide some information about data repositories and data sharing in general.

To answer the query, I would like to provide some background information on data annotation techniques used in deep learning.

In deep learning, data annotation is the process of labeling data to train machine learning models. There are several data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, including:

1. Image classification: This is the process of labeling images with a single class or category. For example, an image of a dog can be labeled as "dog."
2. Object detection: This is the process of detecting and labeling objects within an image. This can be done using bounding boxes, which are rectangles drawn around the object.
3. Image segmentation: This is the process of dividing an image into multiple regions or segments, each of which is labeled with a specific class or category.
4. Instance segmentation: This is a more advanced form of image segmentation that involves labeling each instance of an object within an image.

These data annotation techniques are used to train deep learning models for various applications, such as image recognition, object detection, and semantic segmentation.

In summary, the provided pieces of context do not directly answer the query regarding data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, data annotation is a crucial step in the deep learning pipeline, and the techniques mentioned above are commonly used for training deep learning models.
