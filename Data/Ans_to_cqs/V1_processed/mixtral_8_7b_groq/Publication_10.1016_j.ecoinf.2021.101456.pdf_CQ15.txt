The deep learning pipeline in the given context uses the Adam optimizer for training the models. The Adam optimizer is a popular optimization algorithm used in machine learning and deep learning tasks. It is an extension of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method, which is another optimization technique.

Adam combines the advantages of two other optimization methods, AdaGrad and RMSProp, to provide efficient and adaptive learning rates for each parameter of the model. It calculates the individual learning rate for each parameter by considering the historical gradient information, which helps in faster convergence and better performance.

On the other hand, SGD is a simple optimization algorithm that updates the model parameters by moving in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function concerning each parameter. However, SGD may not always be the best choice due to its sensitivity to the learning rate and the need for careful tuning.

In the given context, the Adam optimizer is used to train the models for 5000 epochs, which is a large number of iterations, allowing the model to learn and optimize the parameters effectively. The learning rate is set to 1e-5, which is a small value, indicating a slow and steady learning process.

Furthermore, the optimization process involves a dynamic adjustment of the hyperparameter β in the loss function of the VAE model. The value of β is adapted every fifth epoch to avoid random fluctuations, and its scaling in the semi-supervised mode is cycled between 0.01 and 0.2 every 100 epochs. This dynamic adjustment of β helps in achieving a reasonable trade-off between the reconstruction and regularization losses, preventing posterior collapse and improving the clustering performance.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline in the given context uses the Adam optimizer for training the models, along with a dynamic adjustment of the hyperparameter β in the loss function of the VAE model. The Adam optimizer is a more advanced optimization algorithm than SGD, providing efficient and adaptive learning rates for each parameter of the model.
