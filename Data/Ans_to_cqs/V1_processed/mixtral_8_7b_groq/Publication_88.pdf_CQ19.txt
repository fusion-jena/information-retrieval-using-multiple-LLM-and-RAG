The specific deep learning frameworks used to build the models are not mentioned in the provided context. The text describes the architectures of two models, EF and SN, in detail, including the number of layers, the type of layers (convolutional, max-pooling, fully connected), and the filter and output sizes of each layer. However, it does not specify the deep learning framework (such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Theano) that was used to implement these architectures. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this query.
