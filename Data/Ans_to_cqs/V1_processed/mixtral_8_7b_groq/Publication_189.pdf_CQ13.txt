The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows:

1. The model was implemented using Tensorflow version 1.14.0 and Keras version 2.2.4 with Python 3.6.
2. The model uses a GPU with a batch size of 1 image per GPU for training.
3. The backbone structures used are Resnet 50 and Resnet 101.
4. The anchor boxes used have ratios of 32, 64, 128, 256, and 512.
5. The image shape is [a, 640, 640, 3], and the mask shape is [a, 640, 640, 1], where 'a' is the number of training images and true masked images.
6. For training on Mask R-CNN, 20 epochs with 500 steps each are used for training images and 100 steps for validation images.
7. The learning rate, α used for heads layer training is 0.001, and during all layers training, α decays by 10.
8. The optimizer used is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, LIBSVM, a library for support vector machines, is used for training.
9. Data augmentation techniques such as random horizontal flipping, random vertical flipping, and random brightness and contrast adjustment are applied to improve the model's performance.
10. The FastFCN backbone is used for semantic segmentation, which rethinks dilated convolution in segmentation.

These are the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
