The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of validation data and early stopping criteria. Specifically, as the model is being trained using the Adam optimizer with 500 epochs and categorical-cross entropy loss function, the validation data is monitored across training epochs. If no improvement is found in 50 epochs, early stopping criteria is applied to halt the training process. This helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the model is not being trained beyond the point of optimal performance. Additionally, the network weights with the best performance are kept, indicating that the model's performance is being tracked and the best model weights are being saved for later use. This approach allows for the careful monitoring of model performance during training and helps to ensure that the final model is well-trained and generalizes well to new data.
