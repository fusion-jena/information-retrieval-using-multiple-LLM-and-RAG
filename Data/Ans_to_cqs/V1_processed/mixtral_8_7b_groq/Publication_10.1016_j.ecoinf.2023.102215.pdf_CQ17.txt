Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization that are used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, the text does discuss the use of dilated convolutions, which can help in reducing overfitting to some extent.

Dilated convolutions are used to enlarge the receptive field, which helps in extracting richer global information. This is achieved by inserting zeros between the weights in the convolutional filters, which increases the spacing between the weights and allows the filter to cover a larger area of the input feature map. This can help in reducing overfitting by allowing the model to capture more contextual information and prevent it from memorizing the training data too closely.

Moreover, the use of a two-level nested model, i.e., a stack of nested encoder-decoder, can also help in reducing overfitting. This is because the nested architecture allows the model to capture contextual information in different scales at a moderate level of computation cost. By capturing information at multiple scales, the model can learn more robust features that are less prone to overfitting.

In addition, the use of the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss function for supervising the model's training can also help in reducing overfitting. The BCE loss function measures the difference between the predicted probability and the actual value, and minimizing this difference indicates a better training effect. By focusing on minimizing the difference between the predicted probability and the actual value, the model is less likely to memorize the training data and more likely to learn robust features that generalize well to new data.

Overall, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization, it does discuss the use of dilated convolutions, nested architecture, and the BCE loss function, which can help in reducing overfitting to some extent.
