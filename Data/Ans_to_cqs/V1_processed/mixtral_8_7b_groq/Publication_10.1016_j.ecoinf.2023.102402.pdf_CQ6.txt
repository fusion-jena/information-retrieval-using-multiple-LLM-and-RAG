The provided context discusses the use and validation of species distribution models (SDMs) in the field of marine biology, but it does not mention any preprocessing steps for deep learning models. However, I can provide some general information about common preprocessing steps for deep learning models based on general knowledge in the field of machine learning.



Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are often involved, such as data normalization, scaling, and cleaning. These steps help improve the model's performance and convergence during training.

1. Data normalization: This process involves rescaling the input features to a common range, usually between 0 and 1. Normalization ensures that all features contribute equally to the model's learning process, regardless of their original scales. Common normalization techniques include min-max scaling and z-score normalization.

2. Data scaling: Scaling is similar to normalization, but it rescales the data to have a unit variance. This technique is particularly useful when dealing with features that have different variances, as it ensures that all features have equal importance in the learning process. Common scaling techniques include standardization and robust scaling.

3. Data cleaning: This step involves handling missing or corrupted data points in the dataset. Missing values can be imputed using various strategies, such as mean or median imputation, or by using advanced methods like multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE). Additionally, outlier detection and removal can help improve the model's performance by excluding data points that do not represent the underlying distribution.

In the context of the provided documents, these preprocessing steps might be applied to the environmental predictor variables before training SDMs for the target species. However, the specific preprocessing techniques used would depend on the dataset and the research question at hand.
