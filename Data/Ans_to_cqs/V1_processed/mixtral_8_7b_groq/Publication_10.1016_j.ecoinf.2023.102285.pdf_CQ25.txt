Based on the information provided, the purpose of the deep learning model is to detect man-made underwater objects (MMOs) within a specific region of interest (RoI) using underwater imagery. The model is trained using a supervised learning approach to discern MMOs from the natural environment. The authors propose a contour-based features analysis method, which assumes that the contours of MMOs are smoother than those of natural objects. The deep learning model is evaluated in three phases: i) training the model, ii) testing the model with a new dataset, and iii) having field experts evaluate the model using a completely new dataset independent from the first and second datasets. The model can be deployed if it passes these three phases successfully. The deep learning model is used for the detection of MMOs, and the authors outline the experimental design of data utilization and data processing phases with their targeted objectives in Table 3. The viability of the methodology was ensured in 4 phases.
