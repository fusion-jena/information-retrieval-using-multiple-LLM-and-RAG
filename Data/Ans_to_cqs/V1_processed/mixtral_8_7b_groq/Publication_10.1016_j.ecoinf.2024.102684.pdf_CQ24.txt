The provided context discusses various strategies and challenges related to the development and validation of deep learning models for remote sensing applications, particularly in the context of detecting invasive species in diverse landscapes. However, it does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of random seed values.

In general, deep learning models often incorporate randomness during various stages of the training process, including weight initialization, data shuffling, and dropout regularization. A fixed random seed value ensures reproducibility of the training process by making the random operations deterministic. This allows researchers to reproduce their results and compare different models or training configurations fairly.

While the context does not directly mention the use of random seed values, it does discuss the importance of model validation and the challenges of ensuring model transferability in diverse landscapes. The ability to reproduce and compare results is an essential component of these validation efforts. Thus, it is plausible that researchers employ fixed random seed values when training deep learning models for remote sensing applications, even if it is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
