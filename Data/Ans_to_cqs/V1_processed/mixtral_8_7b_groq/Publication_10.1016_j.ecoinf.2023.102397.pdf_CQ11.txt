I am unable to provide the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline as it is not mentioned in the given context. The context mainly discusses the use of the Arbimon platform and a random forest model for species distribution modeling, but it does not provide information on where the data or code for the deep learning pipeline is stored or shared.
