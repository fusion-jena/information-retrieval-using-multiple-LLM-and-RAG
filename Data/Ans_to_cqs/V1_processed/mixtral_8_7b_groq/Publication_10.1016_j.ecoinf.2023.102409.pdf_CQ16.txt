Based on the provided context, the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete for the model developed in the study are not explicitly mentioned. However, it is mentioned that the model was trained for 150 iterations. In many machine learning models, the number of iterations or epochs is set as a hyperparameter, and reaching a predetermined number of iterations is a common stopping criterion.

In addition to the number of iterations, monitoring validation loss or error to detect a plateau or decrease is a common practice in machine learning to prevent overfitting and ensure the model's generalization capability. The context mentions that the model's performance is evaluated using robustness scores, but it does not specify whether validation loss was used as a stopping criterion during training.

Furthermore, the context highlights the potential of using various optimization algorithms, such as the Genghis Khan Shark Optimizer, Gazelle Optimization Algorithm, and Dandelion Optimizer, to enhance the model's accuracy. These optimization algorithms can potentially be used to fine-tune the training process and determine when to stop training based on improvements in the model's performance.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the model, it can be inferred that the model was trained for a fixed number of iterations. Additionally, the potential use of validation loss monitoring and optimization algorithms suggests that these methods could have been employed to determine when training should be stopped. However, without further information, a definitive answer cannot be provided.
