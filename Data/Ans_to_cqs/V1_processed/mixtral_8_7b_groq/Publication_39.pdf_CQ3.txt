The text describes the use of several data annotation techniques in the context of deep learning for video action recognition and object detection.

For object detection, the text mentions the use of bounding box annotation. Specifically, for each occurring animal in a frame of the training set, a bounding box is used to depict the location of the animal.

In addition to bounding box annotation, the text also describes the use of instance segmentation for object detection. The VGG Image Annotator (VIA) Version 2.0.8 is used for the annotation of the segmentation dataset, and for each occurring animal in a frame of the training set, a polygonal segmentation mask is used to depict the visible silhouette of the animal. This allows for more precise localization and identification of the objects in the images.

The text also describes the use of data augmentation techniques for both action recognition and object detection. Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the size of a training set by applying various transformations (such as rotation, scaling, and flipping) to the existing data. This can help improve the robustness and performance of deep learning models.

In the context of action recognition, the text describes the use of a dataset called AnnotationsActions, which is split randomly into a train set, validation set, and test set. The test set includes 20% of the video clips of each class, and the remaining clips are used for training and validation.

For object detection, a subset of the AnnotationsActions dataset called AnnotationsDetect is used. This subset is split again into a training subset and test subset, and the test set contains 8 clips, two of each animal class.

Overall, the text describes the use of bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, and data augmentation for object detection and action recognition in the context of deep learning.
