The datasets used in deep learning pipelines can vary depending on the specific task and context. However, some commonly used datasets include MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet.

The MNIST dataset is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. It contains 60,000 training examples and 10,000 testing examples, with each example being a 28x28 grayscale image of a digit between 0 and 9.

The CIFAR dataset is another set of images that is often used for training computer vision algorithms. It contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. There are two versions of the dataset: CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, with the latter containing 100 classes.

ImageNet is a large-scale dataset of images that is widely used for object recognition tasks. It contains over 14 million images, each labeled with one of 21,841 categories. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and testing sets, with the training set containing around 1.2 million images.

In the context provided, the dataset used is not explicitly mentioned. However, it is mentioned that the dataset contains very few images per class, usually only 1-5 thumbnails. This suggests that the dataset is likely to be a custom one, created specifically for the task at hand, rather than one of the commonly used datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.

In summary, the datasets used in deep learning pipelines can vary widely depending on the specific task and context. Some commonly used datasets include MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet. However, in the context provided, the dataset used is likely to be a custom one, created specifically for the task of few-shots learning with a limited number of images per class.
