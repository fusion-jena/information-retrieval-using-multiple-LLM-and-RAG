The provided context does not give specific information about the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline for mapping environmental variables. However, it does mention that machine learning approaches often use spatially exhaustive Earth observation imagery, climatic data, and terrain variables derived from digital elevation models as predictors. These sources suggest that raster image formats, such as GeoTIFF, are likely used for Earth observation imagery. Additionally, the context mentions the use of CSV files for landcover data, which is a categorical variable. While not explicitly stated, it is also possible that other tabular data formats, such as NetCDF or HDF, are used for climatic data. It is important to note that the specific data formats used can vary depending on the particular deep learning pipeline and the data sources being utilized.
