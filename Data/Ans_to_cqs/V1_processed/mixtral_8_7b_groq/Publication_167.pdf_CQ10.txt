Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text focuses on the description of the deep learning model for land use/cover change (LUCC) reconstruction, its architecture, and the data used for training and testing the model. However, it does not mention or provide a link to the code repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide the requested link.
