In the deep learning pipeline described in the context, two primary datasets were used for training the models: the clusters of extracted numbers from the authors' own data and the modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset of handwritten digits.

The authors' data consisted of single-tree point clouds, images of single-trees, and .csv files containing the attributes used to produce the images, reference data, clusters of numbers in two different point-thickness settings, labeled numbers, preprocessed images of the numbers, numbers from the best split, and tables containing the results of their digit recognition. Three models (Models 4, 5, and 6) were trained using the authors' data as input for training.

The MNIST dataset is a widely used dataset for training image classification models. It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits (0-9). In this study, three models (Models 1, 2, and 3) were trained using the MNIST dataset. Specifically, Model 1 was trained using the original MNIST data, while Models 2 and 3 were trained using MNIST data that was modified in size and placement to resemble the authors' data.

Therefore, the deep learning pipeline described in the context used a combination of the authors' data and the MNIST dataset for training the models.
