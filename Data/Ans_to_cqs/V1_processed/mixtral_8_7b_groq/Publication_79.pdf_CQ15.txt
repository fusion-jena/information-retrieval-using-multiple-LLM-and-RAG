Deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), often employ optimization techniques to adjust model parameters and improve performance. Some of the commonly used optimization techniques in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and others.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a popular optimization technique used in deep learning. It involves updating the model parameters in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function concerning a single training example or a small batch of examples. SGD is computationally efficient and helps prevent overfitting by introducing randomness in the parameter updates.

Adam, which stands for Adaptive Moment Estimation, is another optimization technique used in deep learning. It is an extension of SGD that adaptively adjusts the learning rate for each parameter based on the estimated first and second moments of the gradient. Adam combines the advantages of two other optimization techniques, AdaGrad and RMSProp, and has been shown to perform well in practice.

The provided context discusses the use of deep learning techniques for vegetation classification and segmentation in satellite imagery. However, it does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to assume that optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam were used to train the deep learning models.

For instance, in the study by Neves et al. (2021), the authors used a deep learning-based method for semantic segmentation of Brazilian savanna vegetation using high spatial resolution satellite data. They employed a U-Net architecture, which is a popular deep learning model for biomedical image segmentation. U-Net uses skip connections between the encoder and decoder layers to preserve spatial information and has been shown to perform well in image segmentation tasks. Although the optimization technique used in this study is not explicitly mentioned, it is likely that an optimization technique such as SGD or Adam was used to train the U-Net model.

Similarly, in the study by Torres et al. (2020), the authors used deep learning techniques for semantic segmentation of endangered tree species in Brazilian savanna using DeepLabv3+ variants. DeepLabv3+ is a deep learning model for semantic segmentation that uses atrous convolutions and spatial pyramid pooling to capture multi-scale contextual information. Although the optimization technique used in this study is not explicitly mentioned, it is likely that an optimization technique such as SGD or Adam was used to train the DeepLabv3+ model.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it is reasonable to assume that optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam were used to train the deep learning models. These optimization techniques are commonly used in deep learning and help adjust model parameters to improve performance.
