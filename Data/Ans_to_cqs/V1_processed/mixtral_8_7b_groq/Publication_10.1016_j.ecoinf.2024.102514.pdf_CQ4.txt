Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. Data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in image processing and computer vision tasks to increase the size of the training dataset and improve the model's performance. However, the context focuses on the methodology used for selecting the best predictive model for water quality indicator data, and it does not mention any data augmentation techniques.

The context mentions that the WQ indicator data was divided into training and testing datasets using an 80-20 split ratio. They selected 20 and 10 random sample locations for training and testing, respectively. Additionally, the study evaluates the performance of various machine learning algorithms using the methodology of Uddin et al. (2022a). However, there is no information on data augmentation techniques.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot determine the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
