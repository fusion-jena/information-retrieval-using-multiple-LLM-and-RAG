Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of specific image preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning before training a deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that image augmentations were used during training, which include flip, rotations, and affine transformation. Additionally, the model was tested with image data of varying quality obtained from soil chips inoculated from three contrasting soil/soil-like inocula. All the image acquisition was carried out via optical microscopy either in the lab or in situ without staining and labeling. Therefore, it can be inferred that the preprocessing steps, if any, were not detailed in the context.
