The provided context discusses the use of remote sensing (RS) technology and machine learning (ML) algorithms for land use and land cover (LULC) classification, but it does not mention any specific deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.

Deep learning algorithms, a subset of ML algorithms, have been widely used in various fields, including image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition. In the context of image classification, deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been trained on large-scale image datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet.

The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9) with a size of 28x28 pixels. It is a widely used benchmark dataset for image recognition tasks.

The CIFAR dataset includes 60,000 color images of 10 different classes, such as airplanes, cars, and animals, with a size of 32x32 pixels. It has two versions: CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, which differ in the number of classes.

ImageNet is a large-scale image dataset consisting of over 14 million images of 1000 different classes, such as dogs, cars, and chairs. It is a popular benchmark dataset for image classification tasks and has been used to train many state-of-the-art deep learning models.

In the context of LULC classification, researchers have used various RS datasets, such as MODIS, Landsat, Sentinel, CNLUCC, CLCD, Globeland30, FROM_GLC30, ESA-CCI_LC, MCD12Q1, and ESRI_Land Cover_2020. However, the provided context does not mention any specific deep learning datasets used in the LULC classification pipeline.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the provided context does not mention any specific deep learning datasets used in the LULC classification pipeline.
