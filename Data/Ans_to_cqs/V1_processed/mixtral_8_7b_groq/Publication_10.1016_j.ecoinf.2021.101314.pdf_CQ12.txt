The provided context does not give information about the specific deep learning models used in the pipeline. It focuses on the process of redescription mining, which involves generating and filtering redescriptions, or explanations, of patterns in data. The pipeline includes both dental and climate variables, and the redescription mining process is adjusted to balance complexity and accuracy. However, the type of deep learning model used for this process is not specified.
