The provided context includes references to several datasets that are commonly used in deep learning pipelines. These include MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet.

The MNIST dataset is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. It contains 60,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples, each of which is a 28x28 grayscale image associated with a label from 0 to 9.

The CIFAR dataset is a collection of image databases used for object recognition research. It includes two datasets: CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. CIFAR-10 consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. CIFAR-100 is similar to CIFAR-10, but it has 100 classes containing 600 images each. There are 500 training images and 100 testing images per class.

ImageNet is a large-scale image recognition dataset. It contains more than 14 million images, each of which is associated with one of 21,841 categories. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and testing sets, with approximately 1.2 million images in the testing set.

In addition to these datasets, the context also references other datasets such as the "Thueringer Universitaets" dataset, which is likely a dataset specific to that institution.

Overall, the MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet datasets are widely used in deep learning research and are commonly included in deep learning pipelines for training and testing image recognition models.
