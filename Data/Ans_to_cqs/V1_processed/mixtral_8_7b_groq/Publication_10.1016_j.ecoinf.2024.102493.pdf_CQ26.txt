The provided context does not directly discuss data bias techniques during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of the Q value in Ecological Informatics, which reflects the explanatory power of each driver in the Optimal Grid Data (OPGD). The size of the OPGD data sampling grid affects the Q value, and the optimal sampling grid is selected based on the criterion that the 90% quartile of Q values is the largest.

In addition, the context mentions the factor detector, which assesses the independent explanatory power of each driver in relation to the spatial variance in the kNDVI using the Q value. Interaction types are also discussed, including nonlinear weakening, single-driver weakening, double driver enhancement, independence, and nonlinear enhancement.

However, these concepts are not directly related to addressing data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline.

To answer the query, data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline can be addressed using various techniques, including:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on specific criteria, such as class labels, and then randomly selecting samples from each subgroup to ensure a balanced representation in the training and testing sets.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of samples in the minority class to balance the dataset. This can be done by duplicating existing samples or generating synthetic samples using techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of samples in the majority class to balance the dataset. This can be done by randomly selecting a subset of samples from the majority class.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from various sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population. This can help reduce bias and improve the model's generalization performance.

Therefore, while the provided context does not directly discuss data bias techniques during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, the techniques mentioned above can be used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline.
