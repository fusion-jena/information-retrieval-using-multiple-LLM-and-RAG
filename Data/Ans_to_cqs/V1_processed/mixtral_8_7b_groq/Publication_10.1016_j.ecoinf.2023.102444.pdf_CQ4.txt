The provided context does not contain information about data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context focuses on the use of Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for dimensionality reduction and species distribution analysis based on bioclimatic variables.

Data augmentation techniques are commonly used in deep learning to increase the size of the training dataset and improve model performance by generating modified versions of the existing data. These techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, and other transformations that create new samples while preserving the essential features of the original data.

Flipping involves horizontal or vertical reflections of the input data, such as images, to create new samples. Rotating involves rotating the input data by a certain angle to generate new samples. Scaling involves changing the size of the input data, such as resizing images or adjusting the magnitude of numerical data. These techniques help the model generalize better and reduce overfitting by providing more diverse data for training.

Therefore, while the provided context does not mention these specific data augmentation techniques, they are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to enhance model performance.
