The provided context does not include information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The text focuses on the use of the Random Forest classification method for land use and land cover (LULC) changes in the Amazon forest, including the datasets, spectral and water indices, and sampling strategies employed. It does not mention any deep learning techniques or regularization methods. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
