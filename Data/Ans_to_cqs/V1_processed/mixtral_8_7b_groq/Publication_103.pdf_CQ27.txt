Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. However, we can infer some details about the model implementation during the training phase.

The model was implemented using the Caffe framework, and a batch size of 16 images was used for each iteration. The learning rate was 0.0075, and images of 224x224 resolution were used with simple crop and resize data augmentation.

As for model serialization, the context does not mention any specific method or tools used to save and load the trained model. However, since the Caffe framework was used, it can be assumed that the model was saved in a format compatible with Caffe, such as the .caffemodel format.

Regarding platform selection, there is no information provided about where the model was deployed or how it was integrated into a larger system. Therefore, it is not possible to give a specific answer to this part of the query.

In summary, while the context provides some details about the training of the deep learning model, there is no explicit information about the deployment process, such as model serialization or platform selection.
