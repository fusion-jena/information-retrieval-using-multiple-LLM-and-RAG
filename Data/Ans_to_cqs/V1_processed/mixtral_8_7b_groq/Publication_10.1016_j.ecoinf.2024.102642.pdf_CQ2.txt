Based on the provided context, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is audio signals. The CNNs are trained on annotated audio recordings of SEIO PBW vocalizations and blue whale's Dcall. These recordings were made in the Indian Ocean's oceanic zone, between Kerguelen and Amsterdam Island, at a depth of 1000 m with a sampling rate of 240 Hz. The audio signals were manually annotated by a second expert, and a total of 102 vocalizations were used for the evaluation of the SEIO PBW vocalizations. Therefore, the deep learning pipeline in this specific context works with audio data formats.
