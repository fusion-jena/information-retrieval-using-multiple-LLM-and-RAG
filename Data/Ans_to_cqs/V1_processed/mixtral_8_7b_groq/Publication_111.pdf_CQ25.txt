The deep learning model in the study is used for the purpose of regression, specifically for predicting the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Significant Wave Height (SWH) for the Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency dataset. The deep learning model combines Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) with a regular neural network. The GRU layer is preceded by an input layer and followed by a fully connected layer, with the predicted values being produced from the output layer. This model is used to anticipate marine features efficiently and to the best of the authors' knowledge, it is the first use of a GRU model architecture for forecasting SST and SWH. The deep learning model is implemented in Python programming language version 3.8.5.
