I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), their architecture, and the objective function that consists of a reconstruction loss and a regularization loss. It also mentions an unsupervised learning task with a dataset recorded at a different location, but there is no reference to any code repositories such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. I hope this information is helpful, and I'm sorry that I couldn't provide the answer you were looking for.
