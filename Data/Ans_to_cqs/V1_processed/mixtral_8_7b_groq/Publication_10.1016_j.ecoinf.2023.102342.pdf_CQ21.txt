Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the specific postprocessing steps you mentioned, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, the text does provide an overview of the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process, which includes several steps that could be considered postprocessing in a broader sense.

The KDD process outlined in the text includes:

1. Identification of the aim for a specific study area
2. Pre-selection of useful data to achieve the objective
3. Analytical determinations for the detection of patterns or relationships
4. Optimization and elaboration of the obtained results through statistics
5. Mapping and interpretation of the results
6. Display of results in an understandable format
7. Decision making

While these steps may not align exactly with the postprocessing steps you mentioned, they do involve interpreting and refining the results of some initial analysis or modeling. For example, step 4 involves optimizing and elaborating the results through statistical analysis, which could include calculating various metrics. Similarly, step 5 involves mapping and interpreting the results, which could involve generating visualizations like saliency maps.

It's also worth noting that the context mentions the use of open-source software for automatic data processing, which could potentially include postprocessing steps like those you mentioned. However, the text does not provide enough detail to say for sure.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps you asked about, it does describe a process that involves interpreting and refining the results of some initial analysis or modeling. This could potentially include postprocessing steps like calculating metrics, generating visualizations, and so on. However, the text does not provide enough detail to say for sure.
