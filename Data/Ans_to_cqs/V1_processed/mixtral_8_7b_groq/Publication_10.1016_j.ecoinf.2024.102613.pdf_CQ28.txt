The provided context does not explicitly mention which cloud platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.

The first source, "Smart farming IoT platform based on edge and cloud computing," discusses the use of a cloud computing platform for implementing data processing and analytics in a smart dairy farming system. However, it does not specify whether this platform is AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or another cloud service provider.

The second source, "Fully automatic system for fish biomass estimation based on deep neural network," also does not mention the cloud platform used for deployment.

The context diagram and deployment view in the third source provide some insight into the system architecture but do not specify the cloud platform.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine which cloud platform was used for the deep learning model deployment.
