The methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, as described in the provided context, involve the use of specially designed biophys sensors. These sensors are developed at the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ) and are capable of long-term standalone data logging. They measure valve-gaping, water pressure, and temperature, with the valve-gaping measurement based on hall-sensor measurements. All sensors are located in the head of the Biophys sensors. A detailed description of the sensors and data processing to convert sensor output to valve gape amplitude can be found in Bertolini et al. (2021c). However, the context does not mention any use of surveys or public datasets for data collection.

The sensors are used to collect data in the Venice lagoon, but the specific experimental design is not described in detail. The data collected by these sensors, including valve gaping, temperature, and water pressure, can be used in conjunction with empirical laboratory experiments to improve predictions on productivity and aid in aquaculture decision making, particularly in the context of 'precision shellfish farming'.

It is also mentioned that the availability of sensors and the fast development of technology are making it increasingly feasible to collect big-data on valve gaping from sentinel organisms, along with temperature and chlorophyll. This big-data can further enhance the predictions and decision-making capabilities of the deep learning pipeline.
