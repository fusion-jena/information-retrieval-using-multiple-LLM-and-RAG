The provided context does not contain information about the deployment of a deep learning model. In fact, it does not even indicate that a deep learning model was used or trained. The processes mentioned in the text are related to ecological informatics, data analysis, and machine learning algorithms, but not specifically to deep learning model deployment.

The machine learning algorithms that were evaluated are K-nearest neighbors and Decision Tree Classifier. The text mentions that these algorithms were trained and tested using a dataset for 5-class classification, and that their performance was evaluated using Precision, Recall, and F-measure. The dataset was not balanced, and the authors decided to rank the algorithms based on the F-measure instead of Accuracy.

The text also mentions that variable importance was determined using tree-based methods, such as Decision Trees and Random Forests. However, there is no mention of how these methods were used to deploy a deep learning model.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model.
