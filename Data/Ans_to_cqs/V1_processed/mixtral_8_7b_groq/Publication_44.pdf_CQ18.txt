During the training process of the Faster R-CNN model, a strategy was implemented to monitor the model's performance by using a validation loss. Specifically, after every 3000 iterations of training, the validation loss was calculated to evaluate the model's performance. The validation loss is a measure of the difference between the model's predictions and the actual values for a validation dataset, which is a separate dataset that is not used for training.

By monitoring the validation loss, it was possible to determine how well the model was learning from the training data and whether it was at risk of overfitting, which occurs when the model becomes too specialized to the training data and performs poorly on new, unseen data. If the validation loss did not decrease or even increased over a certain number of iterations, it was an indication that the model was overfitting and appropriate measures, such as increasing the dropout rate or reducing the learning rate, could be taken to prevent it.

At the end of the training process, the best performing model based on the validation loss was saved and used as the final Faster R-CNN model. This model was then used for testing with a NMS (Non-Maximum Suppression) threshold of 0.7. The NMS threshold is used to eliminate redundant bounding boxes that have a high overlap with each other, thus improving the accuracy of the model's predictions.

In summary, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involved the use of a validation loss calculated after every 3000 iterations of training. This allowed for the early detection of overfitting and the selection of the best performing model for testing.
