After training a model, there are several postprocessing steps that can be taken to further analyze and evaluate the performance of the model. Here are some common postprocessing steps:

1. **Calculation of Metrics:** Once the model has been trained, it is important to evaluate its performance using various metrics. These metrics can include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, precision, recall, and F1 score, among others. These metrics can provide insights into how well the model is making predictions and can help identify areas for improvement.

2. **Confusion Matrix:** A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model. It compares the predicted labels with the actual labels and can provide insights into the types of errors that the model is making. The confusion matrix can be used to calculate various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

3. **Saliency Maps:** Saliency maps are a way to visualize the features that a model is using to make predictions. They can be used to identify which features the model is paying the most attention to and can help identify potential biases in the model. Saliency maps can be particularly useful in image classification tasks where it can be difficult to understand why a model is making a particular prediction.

4. **Cross-validation:** Cross-validation is a technique that can be used to evaluate the performance of a model by splitting the data into multiple folds. The model is then trained and tested on each fold, and the results are averaged to provide a more robust estimate of the model's performance.

5. **Feature Importance:** Feature importance can be used to identify which features are most important in making predictions. This can be useful in feature selection, where irrelevant features can be removed to improve the model's performance.

Based on the provided context, it is not explicitly mentioned if these postprocessing steps were taken. However, it is mentioned that the performance of predictive models was evaluated using MAE, and a confusion matrix was used to evaluate a classification model in high energy physics. Therefore, it can be inferred that these postprocessing steps were taken in the mentioned studies.
