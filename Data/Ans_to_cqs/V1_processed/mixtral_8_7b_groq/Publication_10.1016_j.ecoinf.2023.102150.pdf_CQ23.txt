The text does not provide explicit information about measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the model was trained on a large dataset of training images, validation images, and out-of-sample test images. The training dataset consisted of 53636 images, the validation dataset consisted of 9444 images, and the out-of-sample test dataset consisted of 9894 images. Additionally, the text mentions that a total of 5364 new images were selected from images taken between summer 2020 and summer 2021 for model retraining. This suggests that some effort was made to include a diverse set of images in the training dataset.

Furthermore, the text mentions that the model was trained from scratch for 55 complete epochs. This implies that the model was trained on the entire training dataset multiple times, which can help to improve the model's performance and reduce overfitting. However, it is not explicitly stated whether cross-validation or stratified splitting were used during the training process.

In summary, while the text does not provide explicit information about measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, it does suggest that a large and diverse dataset was used for training, and the model was trained for multiple epochs to improve performance and reduce overfitting. However, it is unclear whether cross-validation or stratified splitting were used during the training process.
