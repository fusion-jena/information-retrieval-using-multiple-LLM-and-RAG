The deep learning model mentioned in the context is built using TensorFlow. The specific model used is Mask R-CNN, which is a popular framework for object detection and image segmentation tasks. TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning platform developed by Google Brain Team and is widely used in both research and industry for developing and training machine learning models. The use of TensorFlow and Mask R-CNN allows for the analysis of microbial communities in soil chips by segmenting and counting bacterial cells, as well as identifying and quantifying bacterial morphological traits. This interdisciplinary approach combining microfluidics and AI has shown promising results in characterizing bacterial communities and detecting differences among bacterial communities from different locations.
