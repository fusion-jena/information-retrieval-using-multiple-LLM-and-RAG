The provided context discusses the training of deep learning models for animal classification using camera trap data, but it does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps applied to the data before training. However, it is common practice in deep learning to apply certain preprocessing techniques to improve model performance. These techniques include data normalization, scaling, and cleaning.

Data normalization is the process of adjusting the range of input features to a common scale, often between 0 and 1. This can help deep learning algorithms converge faster during training and improve their predictive accuracy. Data scaling involves resizing the input images to a specific size that is compatible with the deep learning model architecture. In the provided context, the input images were resized to 299x299 for Inception-V3, and 224x224 for MobileNet-V2, ResNet-18, and DenseNet-121.

Data cleaning is another important preprocessing step that involves removing or correcting erroneous or missing data points. While the provided context does not mention data cleaning explicitly, it does mention the use of data balancing techniques such as SMOTE to address the issue of class imbalance in the camera trap data. Class imbalance can negatively impact deep learning model performance, and techniques such as SMOTE can help alleviate this issue by generating synthetic samples for the underrepresented classes.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps applied to the camera trap data before training the deep learning models, it is common practice to apply data normalization, scaling, and cleaning techniques to improve model performance. The context does mention the use of data balancing techniques such as SMOTE to address class imbalance, indicating that some level of data cleaning was performed.
