I don't have enough information to determine the exact data repository for the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context. The text provided focuses on the description of the pipeline, its components, and the comparison between learnable and traditional frontends for bird species recognition. There is no mention of where the data repository is located. Common data repositories for such information include Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, and GBIF, as you mentioned. However, I cannot give a specific answer in this case.
