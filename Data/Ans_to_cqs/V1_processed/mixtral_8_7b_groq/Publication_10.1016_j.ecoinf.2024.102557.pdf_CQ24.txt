The provided context does not contain information about deep learning pipelines or strategies for handling randomness in deep learning. The context focuses on machine learning, specifically random forest models, used for image-based species identification and modeling fungal productivity.

In the context, the authors mention using the R package "ranger" (Wright & Ziegler, 2017) for training productivity models based on the random forest algorithm. However, the text does not discuss strategies for handling randomness in the pipeline.

In general, deep learning pipelines may use randomness for various purposes, such as initializing weights, shuffling data, or applying dropout regularization. Strategies for handling randomness include setting fixed random seeds for reproducibility, using cross-validation to assess model performance, and applying techniques like early stopping to prevent overfitting.

 I don't know the answer to the query, as the provided context does not discuss deep learning or strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines.
