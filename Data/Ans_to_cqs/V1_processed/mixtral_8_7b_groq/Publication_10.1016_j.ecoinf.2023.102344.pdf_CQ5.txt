The specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for the study mentioned in the context are not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred that the dataset used consists of raw bivalve images, as the study utilized image-based pre-trained networks such as EfficientNet-B0, ResNet101, MobilNetV2, and InceptionV3 to extract features from these images.

The study aimed to develop BivalveNet, a deep network that could sensitively and specifically identify the sampling location of the provided bivalve shell image. Therefore, it can be assumed that the dataset used in this study is a collection of bivalve shell images, possibly labeled with their corresponding sampling locations.

It is worth noting that the study compared the performance of the image-based pre-trained networks to other approaches such as PCA-NCA integration, U-Net architecture, and tree-structured support vector machines (SVM). These comparisons suggest that the dataset used in this study is complex and challenging enough to require the use of sophisticated deep learning models.

In summary, while the specific dataset used in the deep learning pipeline of the study mentioned in the context is not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that it consists of raw bivalve images labeled with their corresponding sampling locations.
