The provided context discusses the use of airborne imagery and LiDAR data in the development of deep learning models for tree detection. However, it does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting this raw data. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer based on the given information.

However, we can make some educated guesses based on common practices in the field of remote sensing. Airborne imagery is often collected using specialized sensors mounted on aircrafts. These sensors can capture various types of data, including multispectral or hyperspectral images, LiDAR point clouds, and high-resolution RGB images. The choice of sensor and data type depends on the specific research question and the characteristics of the study area.

In addition to airborne sensors, there are also various ground-based and satellite-based data collection methods. Ground-based methods can include terrestrial LiDAR scanners, which provide highly detailed point clouds of individual trees or small areas, and field surveys, which can provide ground truth data for training and validation of models. Satellite data, on the other hand, can provide large-scale coverage of entire landscapes or regions, but at lower spatial resolution than airborne or terrestrial data.

Public datasets are also an important source of raw data for deep learning in remote sensing. These datasets can include both airborne and satellite data, as well as LiDAR point clouds and other types of data. Examples of such datasets include the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) airborne data used in the study described in the context, the University of California's Airborne Data Processing and Analysis Center (ADPAC) dataset, and the European Space Agency's Sentinel-2 satellite data.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it is likely that a combination of airborne and ground-based sensors, satellite data, and public datasets are used in practice.
