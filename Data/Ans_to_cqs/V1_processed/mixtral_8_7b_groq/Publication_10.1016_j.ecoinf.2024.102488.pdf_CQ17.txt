The provided context does not directly discuss regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The text focuses on the use of machine learning techniques, specifically LightGBM and Random Forest, for land cover classification using multi-source data.


I don't have enough information from the provided context to answer the query about regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines.
