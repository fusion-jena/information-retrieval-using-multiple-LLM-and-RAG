The provided context does not give specific information about the deep learning frameworks used in STARdbi. However, it mentions that the system will use deep learning for insect classification and identification. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that is based on artificial neural networks with representation learning.

There are several popular deep learning frameworks available, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and Caffe. TensorFlow is an open-source library developed by Google Brain Team, while PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. Caffe is a deep learning framework made with expression, speed, and modularity in mind.

Given that the system is built using Python, as mentioned in the context, it is likely that one of the popular Python-based deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, is used. However, without explicit information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
