The provided text does not specify the exact type of deep learning model used in the study. It only mentions that machine learning approaches, including deep learning, were used for accurate identification of mangrove species. Therefore, I cannot provide the specific type of deep learning model (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer) used in the pipeline.
