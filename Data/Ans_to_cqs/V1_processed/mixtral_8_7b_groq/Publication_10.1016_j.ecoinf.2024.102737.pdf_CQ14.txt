Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text does not mention any methods such as grid search, random search, or other optimization techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question. It is possible that the hyperparameter optimization process was not included in the scope of the study or was not considered important to mention in the text. However, it is important to note that hyperparameter optimization is a crucial step in building machine learning models, as it can significantly impact the model's performance. Therefore, it is recommended to consider this step in future work.
