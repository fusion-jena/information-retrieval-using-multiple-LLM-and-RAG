Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model. However, the authors have mentioned using machine learning techniques, such as neural networks, in some of their research. For instance, Coro et al. (2013b) combined simulated expert knowledge with neural networks to produce ecological niche models for Latimeria chalumnae. Similarly, Coro et al. (2015a) classified degrees of species commonness using machine learning algorithms, including neural networks, as a case study with North Sea fish.

Considering these studies and general machine learning workflows, it can be inferred that the authors might have followed a process that includes:

1. Model training: Trained the deep learning model using a suitable algorithm and hyperparameters on a dataset, likely prepared by processing and cleaning the species observation data from GBIF and their field observations.
2. Model serialization: Saved or serialized the trained model into a format that can be stored and loaded back into memory for making predictions. Common formats include JSON, XML, or platform-specific formats like TensorFlow's SavedModel or PyTorch's pickle.
3. Platform selection: Chosen a platform or environment for deploying the model, which could be a local machine, a cluster, or a cloud-based solution, depending on the computational requirements and resources available.

However, the specifics of the platform and deployment process are not mentioned in the provided context.


Although the provided context does not offer explicit details on the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model, it can be inferred that the authors might have trained their model using neural networks, serialized it into a suitable format, and selected a platform for deployment based on their previous work. However, the exact process and platform are not specified in the given references.
