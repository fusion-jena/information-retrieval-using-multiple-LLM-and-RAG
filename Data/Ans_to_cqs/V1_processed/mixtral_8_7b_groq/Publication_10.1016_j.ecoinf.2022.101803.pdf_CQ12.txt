The provided context does not mention the use of any deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or Transformers in the pipeline. Instead, it discusses the integration of models into a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and the use of XGBoost, which is a gradient boosting machine learning algorithm. Therefore, based on the given context, it can be concluded that the pipeline does not involve any deep learning models.
