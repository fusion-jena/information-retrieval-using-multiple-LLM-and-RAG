I'm sorry, but the provided context does not include information about a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses various methods used in the pipeline, such as transductive propagation, active learning, transfer learning, and prototypical learning, as well as the use of ResNet-50, Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST), and HuBERT models. However, it does not mention where the data or code for this pipeline is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to a data repository for this pipeline.
