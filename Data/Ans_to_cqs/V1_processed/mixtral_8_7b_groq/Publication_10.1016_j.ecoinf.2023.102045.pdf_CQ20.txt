Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. The context focuses on the topics of color blindness, computational ecology, ecological informatics, mapping, R programming, and scientific communication.

However, it is common practice to use Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) for training deep learning models due to their ability to perform parallel processing, which significantly speeds up the computations required for training these models. GPUs are specialized hardware designed to handle graphical operations, but they have also proven to be very effective for computations in machine learning and deep learning.

Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) are custom-built Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) developed by Google specifically for machine learning tasks. TPUs are designed to accelerate tensor operations, which are the core operations in deep learning models. While the context does not explicitly mention TPUs, they are another option for hardware acceleration in deep learning, mainly used in large-scale production environments.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training a deep learning model, GPUs are commonly used for this purpose due to their parallel processing capabilities. TPUs, another option for hardware acceleration in deep learning, are not mentioned in the context.
