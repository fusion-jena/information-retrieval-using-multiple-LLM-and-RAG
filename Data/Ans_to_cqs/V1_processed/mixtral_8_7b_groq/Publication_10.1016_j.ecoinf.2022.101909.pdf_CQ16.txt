In summary, the training of the model is determined to be complete when the early stopping method is triggered, which is based on the validation loss not improving for a certain number of epochs, in this case 5. This method helps to avoid overfitting and ensures that the model's performance on the validation subset has stabilized, indicating that the model is able to generalize well from the training data to the validation data.
