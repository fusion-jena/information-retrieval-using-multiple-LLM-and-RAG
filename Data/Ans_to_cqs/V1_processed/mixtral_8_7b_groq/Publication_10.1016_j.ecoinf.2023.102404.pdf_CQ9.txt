After reviewing the provided sources, I was unable to find information regarding the data repository of any deep learning pipeline. The sources mention various applications of deep learning in remote sensing, but they do not provide information about where the data or code for the deep learning pipelines is stored.

Some of the sources do mention the datasets used in their studies. For example, Ma et al. (2019) used a variety of remote sensing datasets, including Landsat, Sentinel-2, and MODIS, for their meta-analysis of deep learning in remote sensing applications. Similarly, Mandal et al. (2020) used Sentinel-1 SAR data for crop growth monitoring. However, these sources do not provide information about where the data or code for their deep learning pipelines can be found.

It is possible that the data and code for the deep learning pipelines are stored in repositories that are not mentioned in the sources. However, without further information, it is not possible to determine where the data repository is located.

In summary, after reviewing the provided sources, I was unable to find information regarding the data repository of any deep learning pipeline. If the data repository is mentioned in the sources, I may have missed it. Therefore, I recommend consulting the authors of the sources for more information.
