Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline for creating the high-resolution CHM of the Earth (Lang10m) using Sentinel-2 optical images and a deep learning approach with convolutional neural networks.

The text mentions the use of LiDAR GEDI data, specifically the Lang10m and Potapov30m datasets, but it does not provide details about the data augmentation techniques used during the processing of these datasets.

Data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to increase the size of the training dataset, improve model generalization, and reduce overfitting. However, without specific information in the context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.

Therefore, I cannot confirm which data augmentation techniques were applied in the deep learning pipeline for creating the Lang10m dataset.
