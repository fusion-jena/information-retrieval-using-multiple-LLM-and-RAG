The provided context does not give specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for water quality classification. However, it does mention the use of AlexNet, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. Common optimization techniques used with CNNs include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and Adagrad.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a simple optimization algorithm used to minimize some function by iteratively moving in the direction of steepest descent as defined by the negative of the gradient. In the context of training neural networks, it is used to minimize the loss function.

Adam, which stands for Adaptive Moment Estimation, is a more sophisticated optimization algorithm. It is a method that computes individual adaptive learning rates for different parameters from estimates of first and second moments of the gradients.

Adagrad is another optimization algorithm that adapts the learning rate to the parameters, similar to Adam. However, Adagrad only adapts to the first moment, while Adam adapts to both the first and second moments.

These optimization techniques are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to train models effectively. However, the specific optimization technique used in the study mentioned in the context is not specified.
