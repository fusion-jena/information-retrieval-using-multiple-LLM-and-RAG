Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context focuses on the data collection and analysis process for soil degradation research in a specific region.

However, it can be inferred that the model training process includes the calculation of various factors and their interactions to determine the level of soil degradation. For instance, the study calculates the sum of absolute values of the difference between annual and multi-year average temperatures and precipitation in each grid. Additionally, it calculates the absolute value of population density change rate, absolute value of population GDP change rate, Euclidean distance to residential areas, Euclidean distance to road and railroad, and other factors.

Furthermore, the study mentions the use of the Geographical Detector, a statistical method used for detecting spatial heterogeneity and revealing the driving forces behind it. This method is used to analyze the interactions between paired factors, which are classified as bivariate-enhance (BE) or nonlinear-enhance (NE).

Therefore, it can be inferred that the postprocessing steps may include the calculation of various metrics and visualizations to evaluate the performance of the model and the significance of the factors and their interactions in predicting soil degradation. However, the context does not provide specific details about these steps.
