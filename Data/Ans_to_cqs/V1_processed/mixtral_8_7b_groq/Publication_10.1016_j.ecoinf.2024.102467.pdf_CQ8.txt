Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the description of the EfficientNetV2 network and its improvements over the previous versions, as well as its application for benthic organism detection in aquaculture. However, it does not mention where the code for this pipeline is available. Therefore, I am unable to provide the location of the code repository based on the given context.
