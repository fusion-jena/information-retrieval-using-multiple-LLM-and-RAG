The article does not specify the use of any deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or Transformers in the described pipeline. The machine learning models used in the study are not classified as deep learning models as they do not have multiple hidden layers for feature extraction and transformation. Instead, the study uses an ensemble of machine learning models, including RandomForest, Treenet, CART, and MARS, to predict Short-billed Gull abundance hotspots and coldspots. These models are trained and tested using open-access predictor layers, including socio-economic U.S. Census data, on a GIS platform. The ensemble approach aims to improve prediction accuracy and overall performance by combining the strengths of multiple algorithms. Therefore, the study uses traditional machine learning models in conjunction with a GIS platform and open-access data to characterize the urban seabird niche of Short-billed Gulls.
