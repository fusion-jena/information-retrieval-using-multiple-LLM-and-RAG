The provided context does not contain specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It mainly focuses on the methods and equations used for evaluating the accuracy of a thematic map produced by a calibrated statistical prediction method.

However, it is mentioned that machine learning techniques are used for modeling, and in general, deep learning models require significant computational resources for training. Therefore, it is common to use specialized hardware such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) to accelerate the training process.

GPUs are specialized hardware designed for handling graphics and image processing tasks, but they are also well-suited for parallel computations required in deep learning models. They can handle large matrices and vectors, making them ideal for tasks such as training neural networks.

On the other hand, TPUs are custom-built by Google for machine learning tasks, specifically for tensor operations used in deep learning models. They are designed to provide high-throughput and low-latency, making them ideal for large-scale machine learning tasks.

Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that specialized hardware such as GPUs or TPUs are used for training the deep learning model in the context of the paper. However, the specific hardware resources used are not mentioned in the provided context.
