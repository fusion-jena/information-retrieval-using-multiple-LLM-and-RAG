In the context provided, there is no specific mention of data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of thumbnails for training a deep learning algorithm, which implies some form of image annotation.

Common data annotation techniques used in deep learning for computer vision tasks include:

1. Image-level classification: This is the most basic form of annotation where an image is assigned to a particular class.
2. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing a bounding box around an object of interest in an image and labeling it with the appropriate class.
3. Semantic segmentation: This is a more advanced form of annotation where each pixel in an image is assigned to a particular class.
4. Instance segmentation: This is an extension of semantic segmentation where each instance of an object in an image is assigned a unique identifier along with its class label.

The context provided discusses the use of few-shot learning (FSL) algorithms, which are designed to learn a classification task with only a few thumbnails to train. These algorithms are divided into three main approaches: metric-based methods, model-based methods, and optimization-based methods. Metric-based methods embed both queries and support sets before assigning a class to the query based on distances computed between the query and support sets. Model-based methods train a model on a large database and then fine-tune it on a few support sets. Optimization-based methods learn an optimization algorithm that can quickly adapt to new tasks with only a few support sets.

In the context of the case study mentioned, the authors used FSL algorithms to discriminate 20 coral reef fish species with a range of training databases from 1 image per class to 30 images per class. They found that FSL outperformed classic DL approaches in situations where annotated images were limited, yet still provided good classification accuracy.

In summary, while the context provided does not explicitly mention data annotation techniques, it does imply the use of image annotation for training a deep learning algorithm. Common data annotation techniques used in deep learning include image-level classification, bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. The case study mentioned used few-shot learning algorithms to discriminate coral reef fish species with limited annotated images, demonstrating the effectiveness of these algorithms in situations with limited data.
