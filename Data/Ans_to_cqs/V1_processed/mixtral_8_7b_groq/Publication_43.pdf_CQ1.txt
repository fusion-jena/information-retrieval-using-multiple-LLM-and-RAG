The provided context does not contain specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some sources of public datasets used in deep learning research related to remote sensing and image classification.

For instance, the paper "Classification of High-resolution Remote Sensing Images with Convolutional Neural Networks" by M. Chen et al. (2016) uses public datasets such as the Pavia University image and the Indian pines image for training and testing their deep learning models. These datasets are likely collected using sensors mounted on aircraft or satellites.

Additionally, the paper "Object-Based Convolutional Neural Network for High-Resolution Imagery Classification" by W. Zhao et al. (2017) uses high-resolution imagery data from the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society (GRSS) Data Fusion Contest for training and testing their deep learning models. This data is also likely collected using sensors mounted on aircraft or satellites.

In the field of speech recognition, the paper "Deep Neural Networks for Acoustic Modeling in Speech Recognition: The Shared Views of Four Research Groups" by G. Hinton et al. (2012) mentions the use of public datasets such as the TED-LIUM corpus and the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus for training and testing their deep learning models. These datasets are collected through surveys and recordings of speeches and conversations.

In general, raw data for deep learning research can be collected through various methods such as surveys, sensors, and public datasets. The specific method used would depend on the type of data needed for the research problem at hand.
