Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam used in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the comparison of machine learning methods for above-ground biomass (AGB) estimation using LiDAR and Landsat 8 data. Four methods were used for AGB modeling: AdaBoost, random decision forest (RF), multilayer neural network (NET), and Bayesian ridge regression. However, it does not specify the optimization techniques utilized in the deep learning pipeline.


In summary, the provided context does not contain information about the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
