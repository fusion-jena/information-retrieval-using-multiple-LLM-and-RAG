Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for bird sound noise reduction. However, it can be inferred that some form of data annotation was performed to create a dataset for training the deep learning model.

In the context, the authors mention the use of a deep learning environment based on Python and Tensorflow â€“ GPU as well as CUDA, which was constructed under the Windows operating system. They also mention training a deep feature loss bird sound noise reduction network model for 50 epochs on an RTX 2080 Ti GPU using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 10.

The model was trained on an unspecified training set, with one noisy bird sound signal per iteration. The authors compare the denoising results of the deep feature loss-based bird sound noise reduction network with several other bioacoustics noise reduction algorithms, such as SEGAN, WebRTC, wavelet transform, Wiener filter, and MMSE STSA algorithms.

Given that the deep learning model is trained on a dataset of noisy bird sound signals, it can be inferred that some form of data annotation was performed to create this dataset. However, the specific data annotation techniques used are not mentioned in the context.

Data annotation techniques for audio data can include labeling audio clips with relevant tags or categories, transcribing audio to text, or annotating audio with time-stamped labels for specific events or sounds. In the context of bird sound noise reduction, data annotation techniques could include labeling audio clips with the presence or absence of bird sounds, transcribing bird sounds to text, or annotating audio with time-stamped labels for specific bird sounds or types of noise.

Therefore, while the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for bird sound noise reduction are not mentioned in the provided context, it can be inferred that some form of data annotation was performed to create the dataset used for training the deep learning model.
