The provided context discusses the use of deep learning for semantic segmentation, specifically for delineating the skyline in landscape photos. However, it does not directly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Nevertheless, it can be inferred that pixel-wise classification or semantic segmentation annotation was used, as the model locates and delineates artificial and natural objects in photos.

In semantic segmentation, each pixel in an image is assigned to a specific class. This is different from bounding box annotation, where a bounding box is drawn around an object, or instance segmentation, where each instance of an object is segmented and assigned a unique identifier.

The context also mentions the usage of the COCO dataset, which provides 883,331 object annotations divided into 184 classes. However, it does not specify the type of annotations used in the dataset. However, since the COCO dataset is widely used for training computer vision models, it likely includes various types of annotations, such as bounding box annotations, semantic segmentation annotations, and possibly instance segmentation annotations.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that semantic segmentation annotation was used. Additionally, the COCO dataset, which likely includes various types of annotations, was used for training the model.
