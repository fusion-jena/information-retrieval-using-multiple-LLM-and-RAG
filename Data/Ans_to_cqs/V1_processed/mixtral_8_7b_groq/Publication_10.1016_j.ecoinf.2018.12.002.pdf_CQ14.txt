Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the use of hidden Markov models for the behavioral segmentation of animal movement paths, with a focus on the estimation of model parameters in both Bayesian and frequentist frameworks. It mentions the use of MCMC methods in the Bayesian framework for estimating behavioral states and model parameters, but it does not specify how hyperparameters are optimized in this context.

The text also mentions the potential use of multiple machine learning algorithms and their ensembles for a specific behavioral category, and the possible need to use algorithms other than random forests due to potential issues with their performance. However, it does not provide any details about how hyperparameters would be optimized in this case.

In summary, based on the provided context, there is no clear answer to the query about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It is possible that the text assumes a certain level of familiarity with the methods used for hyperparameter optimization, or that it simply does not address this topic. In either case, the text does not provide sufficient information to answer this query.
