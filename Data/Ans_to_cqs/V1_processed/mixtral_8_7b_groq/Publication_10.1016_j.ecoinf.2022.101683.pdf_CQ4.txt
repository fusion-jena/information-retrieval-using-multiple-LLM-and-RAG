Based on the provided context, there is no information about the deep learning pipeline or any data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context discusses the evaluation metrics for iSDM (Incremental Species Distribution Models) for muntjac deer presence data in Great Britain and Ireland. The models were tested with different spatial extents and treatments, such as random backgrounds, spatial filtering, targeted selection of background points, and weighted background points based on survey effort. However, there is no mention of data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
