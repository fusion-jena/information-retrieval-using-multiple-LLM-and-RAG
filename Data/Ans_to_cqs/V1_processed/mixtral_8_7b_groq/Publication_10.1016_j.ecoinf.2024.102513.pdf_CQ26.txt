The text provided discusses various aspects of deep learning and land use classification but does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. However, it does mention some relevant concepts such as stratified splitting, oversampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting is a sampling technique that ensures each subset (e.g., training, validation, or testing) is representative of the original data's distribution. This can help prevent bias that might arise from having an unbalanced or unrepresentative subset.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to handle imbalanced datasets, where one class has significantly more or fewer instances than others. Oversampling involves duplicating instances from the minority class to balance the dataset, while undersampling involves removing instances from the majority class. However, these techniques can lead to overfitting or loss of information, respectively.

Diverse data collection is another strategy to reduce bias by ensuring that the data used for training the model is representative of the entire population. This includes collecting data from various sources, regions, and conditions to capture the natural variability of the problem.

While not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, other techniques to address data bias include data augmentation, which involves creating new instances by applying transformations (e.g., rotation, scaling, flipping) to the existing data. This can help increase the size and diversity of the training set. Additionally, synthetic data generation can be used to create new instances based on the existing data's statistical properties.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly answer the query, it does mention some relevant concepts, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Other techniques to address data bias include data augmentation and synthetic data generation.
