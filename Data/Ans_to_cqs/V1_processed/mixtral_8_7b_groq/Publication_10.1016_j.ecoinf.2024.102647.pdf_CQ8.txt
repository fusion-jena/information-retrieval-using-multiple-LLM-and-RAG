Unfortunately, the provided context does not contain information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study by Gharechaee et al. (2024) for soil salinity distribution mapping in Lake Urmia, Iran. The study mentions the use of an automated deep learning convolutional neural network algorithm, but it does not give details about the code repository or where it can be found. It is possible that the code was not made publicly available by the authors. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
