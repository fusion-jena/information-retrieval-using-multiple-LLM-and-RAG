The provided text does not contain information about the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The study focuses on the comparison of a deep learning method (SAE) and a traditional machine learning method (SVM) for Landsat image classification, specifically for the detection of invasive S. alterniflora. The authors mention that they conducted a comparison experiment between SAE and SVM with six different types of Landsat images, and the best performance was achieved with the Ppf-CM based SAE method. However, the text does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.

It is important to note that addressing data bias is a crucial step in the development of machine learning models, including deep learning models. Techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection can be used to ensure that the training data is representative of the overall population and to prevent the model from being biased towards certain classes or features.

In summary, the provided text does not contain information about the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
