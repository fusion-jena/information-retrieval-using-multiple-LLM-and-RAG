I'm sorry for any confusion, but the provided context does not include information about a specific deep learning pipeline or its code repository link on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. The context focuses on the importance of generalizability evaluations for predictive models in river health assessments and mentions the use of machine learning (ML) models, including deep learning, in this field. However, it does not give a code repository link for any of these models. I hope this information is helpful, and I'm here to help with other questions you might have!
