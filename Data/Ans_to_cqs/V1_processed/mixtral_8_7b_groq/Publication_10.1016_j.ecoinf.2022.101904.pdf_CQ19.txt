The specific deep learning frameworks used to build the models in the study by Jamali et al. are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The study focuses on comparing the performance of various models for wetland mapping, including Vision Transformer (ViT), Swin Transformer, CoAtNet, CNN + ST (CNN with Swin Transformer), GAN + ST (Generative Adversarial Network with Swin Transformer), and 3DUNetGSFormer. However, the context does not mention the deep learning frameworks used to implement these models. Common deep learning frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras, among others. Without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this query.
