The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is through the use of a leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) approach. This method involves validating the model by leaving out one observation at a time and training the model on the remaining observations. This process is repeated until all observations have been left out once. The performance of the model is then evaluated using metrics such as root mean square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), and bias. In the study, the LOOCV approach showed an RMSE of 13.93 ton/ha, an R2 of 0.88, a MAE of 10.77, and a bias of 0.28. This method helps to ensure that the model is not overfitting the training data and provides a more robust estimate of the model's performance. Additionally, inspections of residual plots were conducted to further evaluate the model's performance.
