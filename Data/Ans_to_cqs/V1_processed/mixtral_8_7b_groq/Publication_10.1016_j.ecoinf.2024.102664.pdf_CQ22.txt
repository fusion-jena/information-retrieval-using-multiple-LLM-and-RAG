The provided context indicates that the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and the coefficient of determination (R2) are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models.

The RMSE is a measure of the differences between values predicted by a model and the values actually observed. It is calculated as the square root of the average of the squared differences between the predicted and observed values. A lower RMSE indicates a better fit of the model to the data.

On the other hand, the R2 is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance for a dependent variable that's explained by an independent variable or variables in a regression model. The R2 value ranges from 0 to 1. A higher R2 value indicates a better fit of the model to the data.

In the given context, the RMSE and R2 values are used to compare the performance of different deep learning models such as CNN, LSTM, and hybrid CNN-LSTM. The RMSE and R2 values are used to evaluate the models' performance in forecasting Chl concentration regions (points A, B, and C) and in the Zhoushan fishery in 2022.

For instance, in the Zhoushan fishery in 2022, the hybrid CNN-LSTM model achieved the highest R2 value of 0.43 and the lowest RMSE value of 1.51 μg/L, while the CNN model exhibited the lowest R2 value of 0.31 and the highest RMSE value of 1.85 μg/L. This indicates that the hybrid CNN-LSTM model outperformed the other models in terms of explaining the variance of the Chl concentration and minimizing the differences between the predicted and observed values.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the RMSE and R2 are the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models.
