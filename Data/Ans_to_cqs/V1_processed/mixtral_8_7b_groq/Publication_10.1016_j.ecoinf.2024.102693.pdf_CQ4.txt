Deep learning models, including Transformer-like and MLP-like models, often benefit from data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of training data and improve model performance. While the provided context does not directly mention data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, it does reference a specific data augmentation method called "Random Erasing" (Zhong et al., 2020).

Random Erasing is a data augmentation technique that randomly selects a rectangular region in an image and replaces its pixels with random values. This method aims to prevent overfitting by creating a more robust model that can handle occlusions and distortions.

Other common data augmentation techniques in the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Flipping: This technique involves flipping the image horizontally or vertically, which can help the model generalize better and be more invariant to image orientation.
2. Rotating: Rotating the image by a certain angle can help the model learn to recognize objects from different viewpoints.
3. Scaling: Scaling the image up or down can help the model learn to recognize objects at different scales.
4. Color jittering: This technique involves randomly changing the brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue of the image, which can help the model learn to recognize objects under different lighting conditions.
5. Random cropping: This technique involves randomly cropping a rectangular region from the image, which can help the model learn to focus on different parts of the object.

These data augmentation techniques can be applied to both Transformer-like and MLP-like models to improve their performance. For example, in the context of Transformer-like models, data augmentation techniques can help the model learn to attend to different parts of the image and improve its spatial information fusion capabilities. In the context of MLP-like models, data augmentation techniques can help the model learn to extract more robust features from the image and improve its classification performance.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention common data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, scaling, color jittering, and random cropping, these techniques are widely used in the deep learning pipeline to improve model performance. Additionally, the context references a specific data augmentation technique called Random Erasing, which has been shown to improve model robustness and prevent overfitting.
