The provided context does not contain information about data bias techniques used during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention data augmentation and transfer learning as techniques used to improve model performance.

Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the size of the training dataset by creating modified versions of the existing images. This can help reduce overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data. The context mentions that data augmentation was used in the study, but it does not specify the type of data augmentation used.

Transfer learning is another technique mentioned in the context, where a pre-trained model is used as a starting point for a new task. This can help improve the performance of the model, especially when the new task has limited data. In the study, transfer learning was used by initializing the models with pre-trained weights from ImageNet.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly answer the query about data bias techniques used during preprocessing, it does mention data augmentation and transfer learning as techniques used to improve model performance.
