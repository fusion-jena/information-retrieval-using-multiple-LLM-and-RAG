In the context provided, the data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline is bounding box annotation. This is used for aerial image processing in the project of car detection using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), specifically the YoloV3 model architecture.

The initial objects in the Sentinel-1 images are outlined as vectors and converted into the darknet annotation format. This involves creating text files containing information on the label class of objects and their positions in the image. The Sentinel-1 images are then cropped into image tiles of 640 × 640 pixels, resulting in a total of 1609 images with corresponding label files. Out of these images, 20% (322) are selected as validation data, and the remaining 80% (1288) for model training.

Figure 2 from the context shows samples of training objects’ bounding boxes, with icebergs in the top row and ships in the bottom row. The targets are shown in single-polarization greyscale, HH (top) and VH (bottom).

The YoloV3 model architecture is a popular CNN architecture for object detection, which is based on the concept of regression. It divides the input image into a grid and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities for each cell in the grid. The ground truth bounding boxes are used to calculate the loss during training, which helps the model to learn to predict accurate bounding boxes for objects in the image.

In summary, for the deep learning pipeline described in the context, bounding box annotation is used for data annotation. This involves outlining objects in the image and converting them into the darknet annotation format, which includes information on the label class of objects and their positions in the image. The YoloV3 model architecture is then used to predict bounding boxes and class probabilities for objects in the image.
