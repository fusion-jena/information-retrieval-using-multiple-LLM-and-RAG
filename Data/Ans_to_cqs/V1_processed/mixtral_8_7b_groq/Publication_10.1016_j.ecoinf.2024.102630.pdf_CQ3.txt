Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for the study. The context focuses on the description of the data sources, the authors' contributions, and the declarations of interest and data availability. However, it is mentioned that the study used remote sensing data from various datasets such as MOD13Q1 V6 NDVI, CDR AVHRR NDVI, GIMMS NDVI, SPOT NDVI, and DEM datasets. These datasets might have been pre-processed and annotated before being used in the study, but the specific annotation techniques are not mentioned.

Common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines for computer vision tasks include bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and panoptic segmentation. These techniques help in labeling the objects or regions of interest in the images, which are then used to train deep learning models for various applications such as object detection, image segmentation, and image classification.

Therefore, without specific information from the provided context, it is not possible to answer this query accurately. However, it is important to note that data annotation is a crucial step in the deep learning pipeline, and the choice of annotation technique depends on the specific task and the dataset being used.
