While the provided context does not directly answer the query regarding data collection methods in deep learning pipelines, it does mention two benchmark datasets used for bird acoustic recognition research. These datasets, BirdCLEF2018-Small (BC-S), BirdCLEF2018-Large (BC-L), Lishui-Zhejiang Birdsdata (LS), and Lishui-Zhejiang Birdsdata (LS*), were recorded in Europe & America and China. The BC-S dataset contains 3118 training, 308 validation, and 308 test sounds, categorized into 14 coarse, 42 medium, and 122 fine categories. The BC-L dataset has 10,216 training, 1005 validation, and 1005 test sounds, classified into 22 coarse, 57 medium, and 309 fine categories. The LS dataset consists of 20,512 training, 2514 validation, and 2513 test sounds, categorized into 13 coarse, 47 medium, and 100 fine categories. Lastly, the LS* dataset contains 10,279 training, 2514 validation, and 2513 test sounds, also categorized into 13 coarse, 47 medium, and 100 fine categories.

Based on this information, we can infer that the data collection methods for these specific bird acoustic datasets include field recordings from various locations in Europe & America and China. However, the context does not provide information on other data collection methods for deep learning pipelines.
