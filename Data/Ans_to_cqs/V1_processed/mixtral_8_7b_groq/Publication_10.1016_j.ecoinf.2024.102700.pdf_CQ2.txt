Based on the provided context, the specific mention of data formats used in the deep learning pipeline is not discussed. However, it does mention the use of deep learning strategies in the context of ecological informatics and species distribution models (SDMs). In this context, the data used for distribution modeling are predominantly visual (84%), while a smaller portion comes from satellite tracking (13%) or acoustic recordings (11%). Additionally, it is mentioned that deep learning strategies such as neural networks have been used in some studies.

In general, deep learning models can handle various types of data formats such as images, audio, video, and CSV files. The choice of data format depends on the specific problem and the type of data available. For example, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are commonly used for image classification tasks, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequential data like audio and text, and deep belief networks (DBNs) for unsupervised learning tasks.

Therefore, while the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline in the context of ecological informatics and SDMs are not mentioned, it can be inferred that they could be using image data from visual observations, time-series data from satellite tracking or acoustic recordings, or other data formats depending on the specific problem and data availability.
