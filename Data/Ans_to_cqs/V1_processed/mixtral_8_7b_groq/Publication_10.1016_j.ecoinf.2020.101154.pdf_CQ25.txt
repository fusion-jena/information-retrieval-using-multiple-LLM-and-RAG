Based on the provided context, it is clear that the described models are not deep learning models, but rather Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT) models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer regarding the purpose of a deep learning model, as the text does not describe the use of such models.

However, I can provide some information about the purpose of the GBRT models in this context. The models are used to identify potential drivers of changes in growth across two herring populations. The authors used GBRT because of its flexible properties, which allow for pattern recognition between the response and explanatory variables without specifying the relationship between them beforehand.

To ensure the models' performance and avoid overfitting, the authors used a two-part split for a grid search and a three-way split for a more robust test of prediction accuracy. They also manually tuned the hyperparameters, starting with a low learning rate and a high number of iterations, and then adjusting them based on the models' performance on the test dataset.

In summary, the purpose of the GBRT models in this context is to identify potential drivers of changes in growth across two herring populations by finding patterns in the data using a flexible machine learning approach.
