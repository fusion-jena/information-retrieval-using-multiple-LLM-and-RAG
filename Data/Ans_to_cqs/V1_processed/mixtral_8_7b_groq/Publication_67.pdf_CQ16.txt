The provided context does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the CNN-based models. Commonly used criteria for determining training completion include validation loss plateau, early stopping, or convergence of the learning algorithm. However, the context only mentions that the training phase involves training five CNN models based on Inception v.3 using two optimization techniques, transfer learning, and data augmentation. It also mentions that the validation phase involves assessing the performance of the tree cover classifications based on Precision, Recall, and F1-measure. Still, it does not provide details about the training process's convergence or stopping criteria. Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete for these models.
