The provided context discusses the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in image processing, specifically for satellite images. However, it does not mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline in general.

Deep learning pipelines can handle various data formats, including but not limited to images, audio, video, and CSV files. The choice of data format depends on the specific problem and the type of data available.

For image-based tasks, such as object recognition or image classification, the data format is typically a multi-dimensional array, where each element represents a pixel value. The context provides examples of this, mentioning the use of satellite images with a shape of 128 × 128 × 3 and 299 × 299 × 3.

For audio tasks, the data format is usually a one-dimensional array, where each element represents a sample of the audio signal. For video tasks, the data format is a three-dimensional array, where the first two dimensions represent the spatial dimensions (height and width), and the third dimension represents the temporal dimension (time or frames).

CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files are commonly used for tabular data, where each row represents a data point, and each column represents a feature. While not explicitly mentioned in the context, CSV files can also be used in deep learning pipelines, particularly for tasks involving structured data or natural language processing.

In summary, deep learning pipelines can handle various data formats, including images, audio, video, and CSV files. The choice of data format depends on the specific problem and the type of data available.
