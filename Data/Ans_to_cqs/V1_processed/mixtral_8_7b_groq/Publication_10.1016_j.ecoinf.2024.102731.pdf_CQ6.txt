While the provided context does not contain information about preprocessing steps specifically for deep learning models, it does discuss preprocessing techniques in the context of habitat suitability models for the European wild rabbit. These techniques can be applied to deep learning models as well.

In the study by Carvalho and Gomes (2003), the authors used a Geographic Information System (GIS) to analyze and preprocess data for their habitat suitability model. They considered various factors such as land use, vegetation, and water sources. The preprocessing steps they mentioned include:

1. Data collection: Gathering data from various sources, including field surveys, aerial photographs, and satellite imagery.
2. Data conversion: Transforming data into a suitable format for analysis, such as raster format.
3. Data reclassification: Assigning scores or categories to different land cover types based on their relevance to the target species. In this case, scores were assigned based on the permeability of the land cover, with very low permeability equal to 0.00 and very high permeability equal to 1.00.
4. Data normalization: Scaling the data to a common range to ensure that all variables have equal importance in the model. In this study, the authors used a linear scaling method to normalize the data.

These preprocessing steps can be applied to deep learning models as well. Data normalization and scaling are essential for deep learning models to converge during training and to prevent variables with larger value ranges from dominating the learning process. Data cleaning, such as handling missing values and outliers, is also an important preprocessing step for deep learning models.

In summary, before training a deep learning model, the following preprocessing steps are typically involved: data collection, data conversion, data reclassification or encoding, data normalization or scaling, and data cleaning.
