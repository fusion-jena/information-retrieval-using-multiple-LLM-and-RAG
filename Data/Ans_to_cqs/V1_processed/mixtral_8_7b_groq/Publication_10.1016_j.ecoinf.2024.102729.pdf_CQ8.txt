I regret to inform you that the provided context does not contain information about the code repository for a deep learning pipeline. The context consists of various research papers and reports related to environmental science, particularly focusing on water quality management, lake eutrophication, and harmful algal blooms. While these studies employ data analysis and machine learning techniques, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or its code repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide the requested information.
