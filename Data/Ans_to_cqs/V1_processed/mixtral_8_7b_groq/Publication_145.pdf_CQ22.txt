The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using two metrics: overall accuracy and the F1 score. The overall accuracy is computed as the percentage of correctly classified pixels, while the F1 score is calculated for each class as the harmonic average of precision and recall. The precision is the ratio of the number of segments classified correctly as class i to the number of all segments (true and false positives), and recall is the ratio of the number of segments classified correctly as class i to the total number of segments belonging to class i (true positives and false negatives). The F1 score varies between 0 (lowest value) and 1 (best value). These metrics are used to assess the model's performance in segmenting the GeoEye-1 tiles of the Brazilian Amazon forest into different classes, including forest formations, other non-forest natural formations, agriculture or pasture, water bodies, and clear-cut deforestation history.
