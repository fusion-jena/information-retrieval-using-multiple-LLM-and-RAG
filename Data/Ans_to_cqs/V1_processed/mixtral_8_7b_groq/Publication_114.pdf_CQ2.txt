The provided context discusses the use of deep learning in image classification, specifically for classifying tree species in a wetland area. Therefore, the primary data format used in this particular deep learning pipeline is image data.

The images of tree species are processed and transformed into feature maps, which are then used for training the deep learning models. Feature maps are essentially multi-channel images, where each channel represents a specific feature of the original image. In this context, the number of bands of the feature maps is 64, while the size of the feature map is given as (height and width).

Before training the deep learning models, data augmentation techniques such as rotation, mirroring, and flipping are applied to the tree samples to increase the amount of training data and avoid overfitting. This process further involves image data manipulation.

Therefore, in summary, the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is image data, which is transformed into feature maps for training the models. Additionally, data augmentation techniques are applied to the image data to enhance the training process.
