The provided pieces of context do not directly answer the query regarding the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, they do mention some types of data used in the studies, which can give us an idea of where the data might come from.

In the study by Azedou et al., 2023, the authors use land cover/land use (LCLU) data for training their deep neural network models. LCLU data is typically obtained through remote sensing technologies, such as satellite or aerial imagery (Eva et al., 2018). Remote sensing is a widely used method for collecting large-scale geospatial data, and it involves the acquisition of information about the Earth's surface through the analysis of electromagnetic radiation (Jensen, 2007).

Barrios-Perez et al., 2021, investigate the impact of El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on rice-producing environments in Central Colombia. They use climate data, such as temperature and precipitation, which can be obtained from weather stations, satellites, or reanalysis products (Fan and van den Dool, 2004). Climate data is essential for understanding the dynamics of natural systems and is often used in machine learning and deep learning applications related to environmental studies.

Bonato et al., 2023, discuss the application of recurrent neural networks (RNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) models for processing sequential data. While they do not explicitly mention the source of their data, they use time series data, which can come from various sources, such as sensors, surveys, or public datasets. Time series data is a sequence of data points measured typically at successive times, and it is widely used in fields like finance, signal processing, and meteorology (Hyndman and Athanasopoulos, 2018).

In summary, the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline can include remote sensing, weather stations, reanalysis products, sensors, surveys, or public datasets. The type of data used depends on the specific application and research question. Remote sensing and weather stations are commonly used for collecting geospatial and climate data, while sensors, surveys, or public datasets are used for time series data.
