The provided context does not discuss specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. It mainly focuses on the comparison of classification networks and their performance in classifying microorganisms.

However, some of the techniques that could be used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on certain criteria (e.g., class labels) and then ensuring that each subgroup is represented proportionally in both the training and testing sets.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of instances of the minority class in the dataset to balance it with the majority class.
3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class in the dataset to balance it with the minority class.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from various sources and ensuring that it is representative of the population of interest.

These techniques can help to ensure that the deep learning model is trained on a diverse and balanced dataset, which can improve its performance and reduce bias.
