The provided context does not give specific information on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. There is no mention of techniques such as grid search, random search, or any other method for hyperparameter tuning.

The context mainly focuses on presenting the results of a study comparing the performance of two methods, Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD) and Variational Bayesian Inference (VBI), in estimating the normalized mean prediction interval width (NMPIW) for non-re-labeled BBCH values and different temperature thresholds.

The study considers various temperature thresholds ranging from 0 to 14 Â°C, and the results for both MCD and VBI methods are presented in Table 8. However, there is no information on how the hyperparameters of the underlying models are optimized.

An exhaustive search for hyperparameters, such as grid search or random search, is a common method for hyperparameter tuning. These methods involve systematically searching through a predefined subset of possible hyperparameters and evaluating the model's performance for each combination. However, the context does not provide any details on these techniques being used in this study.

In summary, the provided context does not contain information on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.
