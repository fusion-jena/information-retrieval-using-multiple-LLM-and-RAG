The context provided does not give specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for wildfire event prediction. However, it does mention that Halgamuge et al. (2020) developed an algorithm to collect data automatically, and Dowdy (2020) measured spatio-ttemporal variations and seasonality across several datasets. 

In general, there are various methods used for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines, including but not limited to surveys, sensors, and public datasets. Surveys can be used to collect data through questionnaires or interviews, while sensors can be used to collect data in real-time, such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed data. Public datasets, on the other hand, can be used to collect data that has already been gathered and processed by other organizations or individuals.

For wildfire event prediction, data collection methods may include satellite imagery, weather data from sensors, and historical wildfire data from public datasets. Satellite imagery can provide information about land cover, vegetation, and burn scars, while weather data can help predict weather conditions that may contribute to wildfires. Historical wildfire data can be used to identify patterns and trends that may indicate future wildfire events.

It is also important to note that the data collection method used may depend on the specific requirements of the deep learning pipeline and the availability of data. For example, in areas with data limitations, data may be collected through a combination of methods, such as surveys and sensors, to ensure that sufficient data is available for training the deep learning model.

Therefore, while the context provided does not give specific details about the data collection methods used in these studies, it is mentioned that data was collected and analyzed using deep learning technology. The specific methods used for data collection in wildfire event prediction can vary, but they typically include a combination of satellite imagery, weather data, and historical wildfire data.
