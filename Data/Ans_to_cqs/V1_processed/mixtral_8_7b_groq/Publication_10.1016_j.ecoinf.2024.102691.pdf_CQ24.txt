In the context provided, there is no explicit mention of strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, there are some implicit strategies that can be inferred from the provided information.

One way to handle randomness in deep learning models is through the use of a fixed seed value. A seed value is used to initialize the random number generator, which is used in various parts of the deep learning pipeline, such as weight initialization, data shuffling, and dropout regularization. By setting a fixed seed value, the same sequence of random numbers is generated every time the model is trained, which ensures reproducibility of the training process. Although the context does not explicitly mention the use of a fixed seed value, the consistent results reported in the evaluation matrices suggest that some form of randomness control was employed.

Another strategy to handle randomness is through the use of batch normalization. Batch normalization is a technique that normalizes the activations of the neurons in a layer, which reduces internal covariate shift and improves the training process. Batch normalization also introduces some randomness in the training process by using a running estimate of the mean and variance of the activations. However, this randomness is controlled and does not affect the reproducibility of the training process.

The context also mentions the use of data augmentation techniques, such as random flipping, rotation, and scaling of the input images. Data augmentation is a strategy that increases the size of the training set by generating new samples from the existing ones. Data augmentation can also introduce some randomness in the training process, as different samples are generated every time the data augmentation is applied. However, this randomness is controlled and does not affect the reproducibility of the training process.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, there are other implicit strategies that can be inferred from the provided information. These strategies include the use of batch normalization and data augmentation techniques, which control the randomness in the training process and ensure reproducibility of the results.
