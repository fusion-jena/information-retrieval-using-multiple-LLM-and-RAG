The techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. These methods are used to ensure that the training data is representative and unbiased, which can improve the performance and generalizability of the deep learning model.

Stratified splitting is a technique used to divide a dataset into training and testing sets in a way that ensures that the distribution of important variables is similar in both sets. This can help to prevent bias and ensure that the model is able to generalize well to new data.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to address class imbalance in a dataset. Class imbalance occurs when one class has many more examples than another class, which can lead to bias in the model. Oversampling involves creating more examples of the minority class, while undersampling involves reducing the number of examples of the majority class. These techniques can help to balance the dataset and improve the performance of the model.

Diverse data collection is a technique used to ensure that the training data is representative of the population and includes examples of all relevant classes and variations. This can help to prevent bias and ensure that the model is able to generalize well to new data.

In the context of the provided articles, these techniques could be used to preprocess data for a deep learning pipeline that aims to classify different types of vegetation or bird species. For example, the authors of "Can sampling for vegetation characterisation surrogate for species richness? Case studies from the wetâ€“dry tropics of northern Australia" (Patykowski et al., 2021) could use stratified splitting to divide their dataset of vegetation samples into training and testing sets, ensuring that the distribution of different vegetation types is similar in both sets. The authors of "Mark recapture distance sampling: using acoustics to estimate the fraction of dolphins missed by observers during shipboard line-transect surveys" (Rankin et al., 2020) could use oversampling or undersampling to balance their dataset of dolphin sightings, which may be biased towards certain types of dolphins or certain locations.

In summary, the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. These methods can help to ensure that the training data is representative and unbiased, which can improve the performance and generalizability of the deep learning model.
