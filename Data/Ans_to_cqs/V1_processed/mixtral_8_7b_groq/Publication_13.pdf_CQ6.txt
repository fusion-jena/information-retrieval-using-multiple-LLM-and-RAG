The provided context does not include specific details about the preprocessing steps taken before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention that an algorithm for domain adaptation, called Domain Adversarial Training of Neural Networks (DANN), was used to improve the prediction performance of models trained by non-standardized, low-quality images. This suggests that some preprocessing was done to account for the variability in image quality.

In general, preprocessing steps for training deep learning models with image data can include:

1. Normalization: This involves scaling the pixel intensity values of the images to a range between 0 and 1. This helps to ensure that all images have similar ranges of pixel intensity values, which can improve the training of the model.
2. Data augmentation: This involves creating new training examples by applying random transformations to the original images, such as rotation, scaling, and flipping. This can help to increase the size of the training dataset and reduce overfitting.
3. Cleaning: This involves removing any irrelevant or unwanted features from the images, such as dust particles or other debris.
4. Feature extraction: This involves extracting relevant features from the images, such as edges, corners, or shapes. This can help to reduce the dimensionality of the data and improve the training of the model.

In the context of the study, the authors used a subset of single specimens taken from bulk samples and photographed them using a conventional stereoscope. These images were then used to train a deep learning model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. However, the specific preprocessing steps taken are not mentioned.

Therefore, while the provided context does not give specific details about the preprocessing steps taken, it is likely that some combination of normalization, data augmentation, cleaning, and feature extraction were used to prepare the image data for training the deep learning model.
