Based on the provided context, there is no information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The text focuses on the use of different diversity indices in forestry and the relative root mean square error (rRMSE) of these indices. It discusses sample points, sample trees, and individual inclusion zone radii, as well as the basal area factor. However, it does not provide any details about the training process or the criteria used to determine training completion. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
