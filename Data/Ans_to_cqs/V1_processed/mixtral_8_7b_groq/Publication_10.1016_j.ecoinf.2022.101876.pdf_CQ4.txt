Based on the provided context, the text does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is common practice in deep learning to use data augmentation techniques to increase the amount and diversity of training data, improve model performance, and reduce overfitting.

Some common data augmentation techniques include:

1. Flipping: This involves flipping the images horizontally or vertically to create new training examples. Flipping can help the model generalize better and become more robust to variations in image orientation.
2. Rotating: Rotating the images by a certain angle can help the model learn to recognize objects in different orientations. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where the orientation of the objects in the images may vary.
3. Scaling: Scaling the images up or down can help the model learn to recognize objects at different scales. This can be useful in scenarios where the size of the objects in the images may vary.
4. Translation: Translating the images horizontally or vertically can help the model learn to recognize objects in different positions. This can be useful in scenarios where the position of the objects in the images may vary.
5. Color jittering: Changing the brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue of the images can help the model learn to recognize objects in different lighting conditions. This can be useful in scenarios where the lighting conditions may vary.

These techniques can be applied to the training data during the deep learning pipeline to create new training examples and improve model performance. However, the specific data augmentation techniques used in the study mentioned in the context are not provided.
