The provided context discusses the use of deep learning techniques primarily for image recognition and classification tasks. Therefore, the data formats specifically mentioned are related to image data.

In the context, LeNet, AlexNet, VGG, and GoogLeNet are deep learning models used for image classification. LeNet was proposed in the 1990s and includes three convolution layers, two sampling layers, and two fully connected layers [21]. AlexNet, which won the ILSVRC 2012, achieves higher identifying accuracy than traditional machine learning algorithms for image classification tasks [22]. VGG, proposed by Simonyan et al. in 2014, uses a 3 Ã— 3 filter and a stride of 2 [24]. GoogLeNet, the winner of ILSVRC 2014, integrates inception layers with different kernel sizes to capture sparse correlation patterns [23].

For these image-based deep learning models, image data is typically used as input. Image data can be represented in various formats, such as JPEG, PNG, or BMP. However, the context does not explicitly mention the specific image file formats used in the deep learning pipelines. Instead, the focus is on the deep learning architectures and their performance in image classification tasks.

In summary, while the provided context discusses deep learning models for image classification, it does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline beyond image data. Image data can be represented in various formats, such as JPEG, PNG, or BMP.
