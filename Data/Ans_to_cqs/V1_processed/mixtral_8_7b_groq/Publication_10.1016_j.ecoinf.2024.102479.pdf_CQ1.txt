The provided context does not give specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for the study in question. However, it does mention some sources of data and types of environmental variables used in the study.

The study used above-ground biomass (AGB) data collected from sampling plots in the BRT Tiger Reserve, located in India. The AGB data was collected on November 25, 2020, and is shown in Figure 2b of the study. Additionally, the study used satellite data from Sentinel-2, which was processed using ESAâ€™s Sentinel-2 Toolbox.

Furthermore, the study used soil data from the SoilGrids250m database, which provides global gridded soil information based on machine learning. This database includes various soil properties, such as pH, carbon, and other variables listed in Table S3 of the study.

The study also used the Global Wood Density (WD) database to calculate WD values. This database was created using data from Chave et al. (2009) and Zanne et al. (2009).

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data, it does indicate that the study used a combination of field surveys, satellite data, and public datasets to collect and generate the data used in the deep learning pipeline.
