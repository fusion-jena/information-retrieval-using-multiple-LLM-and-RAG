The provided context does not give specific details about the type of data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the study used a deep convolutional neural network (ResNet-50) for bird call recognition. Therefore, it can be inferred that some form of audio annotation was used to label the bird calls in the dataset.

The context also mentions the use of an active learning approach to iteratively train and improve the CNN model. In the context of machine learning, active learning is a special case of machine learning where a learning algorithm can interactively query the user (or some other information source) to obtain the desired outputs at new data points. In other words, the algorithm selects the data points to be labeled based on the current state of the model and its uncertainty about the labels of new data points. This approach can be useful for reducing the number of labeled examples required for training a deep learning model, especially when labeling data is time-consuming or expensive.

Additionally, the context mentions that the study used a classification approach that allowed the CNN model to classify sounds into an 'uncertain' category. This approach can be useful for handling data points that are difficult to classify or for identifying areas where inter-annotator agreement may be improved.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific details about the type of data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it does mention the use of audio annotation for bird call recognition, active learning for iteratively training and improving the CNN model, and classification into an 'uncertain' category for handling difficult-to-classify data points.
