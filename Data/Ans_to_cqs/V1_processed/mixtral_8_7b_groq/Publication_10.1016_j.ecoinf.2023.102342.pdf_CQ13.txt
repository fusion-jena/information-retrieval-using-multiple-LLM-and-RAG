Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model. The context focuses on the use of data mining techniques and measures such as support, confidence, lift, leverage, and conviction. It discusses various studies related to artificial intelligence, soil fertility properties, herbicide fate and transport, and crop yield modeling. However, it does not mention any deep learning models or their hyperparameters.

Hyperparameters are crucial configuration variables in deep learning models that can significantly impact the model's performance. Examples of hyperparameters include learning rate, optimizer, number of layers, number of neurons, batch size, and regularization techniques. The learning rate determines the size of the steps in the gradient descent process, while the optimizer is the algorithm used to find the minimum of the loss function.

Since the context does not provide information on the deep learning model or its hyperparameters, it is not possible to give a specific answer to this query. To determine the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, one would need access to the model's configuration or the study describing the model's implementation.
