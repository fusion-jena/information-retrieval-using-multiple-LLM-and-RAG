I am unable to provide a direct data repository link for the deep learning pipeline you mentioned because none was provided in the context. However, I can tell you that the use of deep learning algorithms in strategic planning was discussed in a report from 1998. Additionally, a study from 2023 by Ren, Cao, and Du analyzed the ecosystem service value and changes in food supply and demand in Liaoning Province, China, using a deep learning algorithm. It is possible that the data and code used in this study are available in a repository, but I cannot confirm that without further information.
