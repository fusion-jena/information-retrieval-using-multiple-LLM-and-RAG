Based on the provided context, the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are not mentioned. However, the text does provide several other metrics related to the study of mangrove forests along the southeastern coast of China.

The study used a variety of data from 1985 to 2020, including calendar years and different land cover types such as impervious water surface, water, forest, farmland, mangrove forest, and other. The accuracy of the land cover classification was evaluated using userâ€™s accuracy, total accuracy, and the Kappa coefficient. These metrics were higher from 2015 to 2020 than from 1985 to 1995.

Additionally, the study used four landscape metrics to evaluate the number of land cover types, distances between patches of the same land cover type, and the degrees of aggregation and segmentation. These metrics include patch density (PD), largest patch index (LPI), area-weighted mean Euclidean nearest-neighbor distance (ENN_AM), and aggregation index (AI).

It is important to note that the limitations of data sources and classification methods may have affected the understanding of various mangrove species status in China and globally. Furthermore, although the study discussed the effects of governmental policies on long-term mangrove evolution, it was still difficult to quantify the contribution rate of policies on mangrove conservation and restoration.

Therefore, while the provided context does not directly answer the query regarding the metrics used to evaluate the deep learning model, it does offer insight into other metrics used in the study of mangrove forests.
