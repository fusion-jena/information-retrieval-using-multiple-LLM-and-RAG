Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, the study did use a stratified splitting approach when creating the training and test sets. Stratified sampling is a method of sampling that ensures each subset (or stratum) of the population has an proportionate number of observations. This can help ensure that the training and test sets are representative of the overall population and can reduce bias.

Additionally, the study used a technique called data thinning during preprocessing of the LiDAR data. This was done by randomly selecting a fixed number of points from each cloud subsection, weighted by the ratio of first returns versus all returns, to simulate a uniform density of emitted laser pulses. This technique could potentially help reduce bias by ensuring that each subset of the data is represented in a similar manner.

It is worth noting that the study did not mention using other common techniques for addressing data bias such as oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it is possible that these techniques were not necessary for this particular study due to the use of stratified splitting and data thinning.

In summary, the study utilized a stratified splitting approach and data thinning technique during preprocessing of the LiDAR data, which can help reduce bias in the training and test sets. However, other common techniques for addressing data bias such as oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection were not mentioned.
