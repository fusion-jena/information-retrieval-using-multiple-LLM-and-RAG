The provided context does not contain information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The first source, "WT-HMM using varying dataset sizes over 10 runs" by O.P. Babalola and J. Versfeld (2024), focuses on the performance evaluation of a wavelet transform-hidden Markov model (WT-HMM) for blue whale vocalization analysis in the Antarctic region. The second source, "Feature Extraction Methods for the Detection of North Atlantic Right Whale Up-Calls" by Ibrahim et al. (2018), discusses various feature extraction techniques for detecting right whale up-calls. The third source, "Birdnet: a deep learning solution for avian diversity monitoring" by Kahl et al. (2021), presents a deep learning model for bird species identification. However, none of these sources mention the platform used for deployment.
