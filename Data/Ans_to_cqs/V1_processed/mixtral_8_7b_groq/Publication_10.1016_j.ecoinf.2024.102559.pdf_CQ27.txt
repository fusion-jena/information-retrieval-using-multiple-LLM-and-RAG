The provided context does not give specific details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of machine learning and cloud computing for invasive species monitoring, and the creation of a map of iceplant locations in Santa Barbara County as an example of such a combination.

It is likely that the trained deep learning model was serialized, or saved in a way that allows it to be loaded and used again, so that it can be deployed on a cloud computing platform. This process would allow the model to be accessed and run on the large amounts of data required for remote sensing and invasive species monitoring.

Additionally, the use of Python libraries such as scikit-learn and scikit-image, which are mentioned in the context, may have been helpful in the deployment process. Scikit-learn is a machine learning library that includes functions for model serialization, and scikit-image is an image processing library that could be used for pre-processing the remote sensing data before inputting it into the deep learning model.

It is also possible that the deep learning model was deployed using a specific platform or service for deep learning, such as TensorFlow Serving or AWS SageMaker. These platforms allow for the deployment of trained models in a scalable and efficient way, making them suitable for use with large amounts of data.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, it is likely that the model was serialized and deployed on a cloud computing platform, potentially using Python libraries and a deep learning platform or service.
