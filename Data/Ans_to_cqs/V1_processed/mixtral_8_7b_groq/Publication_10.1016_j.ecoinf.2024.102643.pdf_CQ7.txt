Based on the provided context, there is no information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context focuses on the description of different models used for predicting human-wildlife conflicts, their performance, and the construction of an ensemble model. There is no mention of deep learning models or the data splitting criteria used in such models.

In general, when training deep learning models, it is common to split the data into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final model performance. However, the specific criteria for splitting the data can vary depending on the problem, dataset size, and other factors. Common approaches include random sampling, stratified sampling, or time-series-based splitting.

In summary, the provided context does not contain information on the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training.
