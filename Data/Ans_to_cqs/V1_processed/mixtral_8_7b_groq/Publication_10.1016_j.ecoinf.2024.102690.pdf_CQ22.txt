I'm sorry for any confusion, but the provided context does not include information about the performance metrics used to evaluate a deep learning model. The context mainly discusses the use of the Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM) neural network approach for identifying ecological sources and constructing spatially balanced Ecological Source-Sink Landscapes (ESPs) in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region.

The text mentions the use of the Davis-Boldin Index (DBI) to determine the ideal number of ES bundles and hotspot analysis (Getis-Ord G*i) for spatial clustering. However, it does not specify any evaluation metrics for deep learning models like accuracy, precision, or recall.
