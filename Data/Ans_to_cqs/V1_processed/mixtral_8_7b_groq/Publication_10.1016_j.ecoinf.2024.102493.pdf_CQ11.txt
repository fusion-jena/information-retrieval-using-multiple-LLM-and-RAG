The provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The context consists of two research articles by Gu et al. (Year 2024), which focus on the analysis of vegetation trends using kNDVI (kernel Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) in specific geographical regions (39′ N to 28′ N latitude and 39′ E to 119′ E longitude, and 25′ S to 69′ N latitude and 25′ S to 69′ E longitude).

The articles discuss the research framework, classification of kNDVI, and the trend types based on slope and significance levels. However, there is no mention of any data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information.
