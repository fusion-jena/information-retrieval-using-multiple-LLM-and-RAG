The deep learning model in the study was implemented using PyTorch Lightning, which is a deep learning framework built on top of PyTorch. PyTorch is a popular open-source machine learning library developed by Facebook's artificial intelligence research group. PyTorch Lightning provides improved scalability and enables faster experimentation, making it easier to build and train large-scale deep learning models. The hyperparameters of the models were tuned using an Optuna-based hyperparameter optimization procedure. Optuna is an automatic hyperparameter optimization framework that uses a Bayesian optimization algorithm to find the best set of hyperparameters for a given model.

Therefore, the deep learning model in the study was built using PyTorch Lightning, which is a framework built on top of PyTorch, and Optuna for hyperparameter tuning.

It is worth noting that the study used purely deterministic variants of deep learning architectures and did not employ residual connections between the layers of a deep neural network to obtain a single prediction. Instead, the Baseline Framework added residual connections in between predictions.

In summary, the deep learning model in the study was built using PyTorch Lightning, a deep learning framework built on top of PyTorch, and Optuna for hyperparameter tuning.
