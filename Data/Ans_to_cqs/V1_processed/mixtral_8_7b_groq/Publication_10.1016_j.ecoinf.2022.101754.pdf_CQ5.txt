Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for forest aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation. However, it is mentioned that the study by Zhang et al. (2019) used a deep learning-based retrieval of forest AGB.

In general, the choice of datasets for training deep learning models depends on the specific problem and context. For image-based deep learning tasks, popular datasets include MNIST (handwritten digits), CIFAR (object recognition), and ImageNet (object recognition). However, for remote sensing applications like forest AGB estimation, the datasets typically consist of LiDAR and multispectral or hyperspectral imagery.

In the context of forest AGB estimation, the study by Xue (2015) used LiDAR and Landsat 8 data for estimating hardwood forest biomass in mountainous and bottomland environments. Similarly, the study by Zhang et al. (2019) used LiDAR data for deep learning-based forest AGB retrieval. The study by Ali et al. (2015) also used LiDAR data for biomass retrieval using machine learning approaches.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the deep learning pipeline for forest AGB estimation likely uses LiDAR and multispectral or hyperspectral imagery datasets. However, the specific names of the datasets are not mentioned in the provided context.
