The provided context discusses the data model and process flow for handling fish specimens in the IFBA database, including the use of image files for scale and otolith samples. However, it does not explicitly mention the deep learning pipeline or the specific data formats used within it.

Based on the context, we can infer that image files are a significant data format used in this process. Specifically, scale and otolith images are utilized for age and growth estimations. These images are stored in a collaborative online space, with the image file name being the same as the unique archive sample id in the IFBA database.

However, without further information, it is impossible to definitively state whether other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV files are used in the deep learning pipeline. It is plausible that these formats could be used, but the context does not provide enough information to confirm this.

In conclusion, while image files are a clear data format used in the process, the provided context does not allow us to definitively answer the query regarding the use of other data formats like audio, video, or CSV files in the deep learning pipeline.
