Based on the provided context, there is no information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline being available on Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. The context discusses several studies and methods related to deep learning and acoustic data analysis, but it does not mention any specific data repository for these studies.

In the study by Quinn et al. (2022), they used ecoacoustic data for soundscape classification with convolutional neural networks. However, the context does not provide information about the availability of their data repository. Similarly, in the study by Pouyanfar et al. (2018), they explored different network sizes and pre-training with additional acoustic reference data, but there is no information about the data repository.

In the BirdCLEF competitions, weakly-labeled audio data were used for birdsong recognition, but again, the context does not provide information about the data repository. The studies by Priyadarshani et al. (2018) and Pyle and DeSante (2003) also do not mention any data repository related to their research.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query as the information is not available in the given context.
