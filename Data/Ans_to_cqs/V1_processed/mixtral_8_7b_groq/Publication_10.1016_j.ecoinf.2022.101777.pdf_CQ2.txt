The provided context does not give specific information about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that satellite images are used in the study. Therefore, it can be inferred that image data formats, such as raster or GeoTIFF, are likely used in this particular deep learning pipeline.

The context also explains that the images were resampled from 20m bands to 10m bands, which suggests that the original image data was in a format that allowed for such manipulation. Additionally, the images were classified using a Random Forest model, which typically requires numerical data for input features. In this case, the input features could be various spectral bands or vegetation indices derived from the satellite images.

However, the context does not mention any other data formats like audio, video, or CSV. It is possible that these formats are not used in this specific deep learning pipeline. Nonetheless, it is important to note that deep learning models can handle various data formats depending on the problem and the available data. For instance, time-series data can be stored in CSV format, while audio or video data can be processed using formats such as WAV or MP4.

In summary, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that image data formats, such as raster or GeoTIFF, are used in this deep learning pipeline for satellite image analysis. However, there is no information about other data formats like audio, video, or CSV.
