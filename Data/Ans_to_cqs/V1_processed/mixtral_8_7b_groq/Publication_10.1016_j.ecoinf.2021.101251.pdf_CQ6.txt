The provided context discusses data management and publication in the ESS-DIVE repository, but it does not directly mention preprocessing steps for training deep learning models. However, it does touch upon some related topics, such as data processing, cleaning, and curation.



Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are often required, including normalization, scaling, and cleaning. These steps help to prepare the data, making it more suitable for the model and improving the model's performance.

1. Data cleaning: This step involves identifying and handling missing or incorrect data points. Inconsistencies in the data, such as outliers or invalid entries, can negatively impact the model's ability to learn from the data. By addressing these issues, the model can focus on the relevant and accurate information.

2. Normalization and scaling: These techniques aim to adjust the data's range and distribution, making it easier for the model to learn from the data. Normalization typically involves rescaling the data between 0 and 1, while scaling can maintain the original range but shift the data's mean to 0 and reduce its standard deviation. These methods help to prevent certain features from dominating the learning process and ensure that the model treats all features equally.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention these preprocessing steps, it does discuss the importance of data processing and curation in the context of data publication and long-term stewardship. This highlights the significance of properly preparing data before using it in deep learning models or other applications.
