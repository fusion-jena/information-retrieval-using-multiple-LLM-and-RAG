While the provided context does not directly discuss deep learning or strategies for handling randomness in its pipeline, it does offer insights into how randomness is managed in the context of object-oriented random forest classification. Some of these strategies could potentially be applied to deep learning.

In the context of object-oriented random forest classification, randomness is handled through the use of a random seed value. Specifically, Table 8 and Table 9 show the evaluation results of object-oriented random forest classification accuracy in 2
