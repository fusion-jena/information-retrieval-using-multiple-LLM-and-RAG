The provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the study analyzed aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation using field data and predicted it using remotely sensed optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) datasets and their derived indices. This implies that the authors used a combination of field surveys and remote sensing techniques to collect the raw data.

Field surveys are a common method for collecting data in ecological studies. In this case, the authors used 196 sample plots to estimate the AGB (as shown in Figure 3b). Surveys can provide detailed information about the study area, including the type and age of vegetation, which can be used to estimate AGB.

Remote sensing techniques, such as optical and SAR datasets, are used to collect data from a distance. These techniques can provide information about large areas quickly and cost-effectively. In this study, the authors used optical and SAR datasets and their derived indices to predict AGB. These datasets could have been obtained from satellite or airborne sensors.

Public datasets are another potential source of raw data for deep learning pipelines. However, the provided context does not mention whether any public datasets were used in this study.

In summary, the study likely used a combination of field surveys and remote sensing techniques to collect raw data. However, the context does not provide specific details about the methods used.
