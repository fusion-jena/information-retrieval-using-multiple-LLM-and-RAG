The context does not provide specific information about the purpose of the deep learning model used in the study by Huang et al., 2019. However, it can be inferred that the deep learning model was used for monitoring ecosystem service change in the City of Shenzhen by the use of high-resolution remotely sensed imagery. The model was likely used for image classification, segmentation, or object detection tasks, as these are common applications of deep learning in remote sensing and geospatial analysis.

Image classification involves categorizing pixels or image regions into predefined classes, such as land cover types (e.g., forest, grassland, urban). Segmentation is a more detailed version of classification, where the goal is to delineate the boundaries of objects or regions of interest (e.g., individual trees, buildings, roads). Object detection involves identifying and locating objects of interest within an image, often by generating bounding boxes around them.

In the context of monitoring ecosystem service change, the deep learning model could have been used for any of these tasks. For example, it could have been used to classify land cover types, segment vegetation or water bodies, or detect changes in land use over time. However, the specific purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
