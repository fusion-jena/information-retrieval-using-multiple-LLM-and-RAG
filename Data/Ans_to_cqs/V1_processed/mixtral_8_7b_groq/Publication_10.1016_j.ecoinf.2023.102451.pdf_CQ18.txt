The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training in the context provided involves the use of precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy as performance evaluation indicators. These metrics are commonly used to assess the classification performance of models.

Precision is calculated as the ratio of true positive predictions to all positive predictions made by the model. Recall, also known as sensitivity, is defined as the number of positive samples predicted correctly to all positive samples. The F1-score is a harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that encapsulates both. Accuracy is measured as the ratio of true positive and true negative predictions to the overall collected samples.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed model, EMViT-Net, on the unseen test set of EMDS-6. The model is optimized with a learning rate of 0.002 and a batch size of 32, and is trained for 100 epochs with the AdamW optimizer and the GELU activation function. The cross-entropy loss function is used to calculate the loss of the proposed network.

The loss and accuracy curves of the EMViT-Net model are provided, representing the training and validation accuracy with their corresponding loss. These curves allow for the monitoring of the model's performance during training, providing insights into the model's ability to fit the data and generalize to unseen samples.

In addition, the performance of EMViT-Net is compared to that of other deep learning models on the EMDS-6 test set, both before and after data augmentation. The average precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy are reported for each model, providing a comprehensive comparison of their performance.

Overall, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of various performance evaluation metrics, visualizations of the loss and accuracy curves, and comparisons to other models. This approach allows for a thorough assessment of the model's performance and its ability to generalize to unseen data.
