The specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model for classification purposes in digital soil mapping or other related fields can vary depending on the study and the researchers' preferences. However, some commonly used metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Accuracy is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions. It is a common and straightforward metric for evaluating the performance of a classification model. However, it may not be the best metric when dealing with imbalanced datasets, where one class may have significantly more samples than another.

Precision, also known as positive predictive value, is the ratio of true positive predictions (correctly predicted positive samples) to the total predicted positive samples. It is useful when the cost of a false positive is high, as it measures the proportion of relevant instances among the retrieved instances.

Recall, also known as sensitivity, is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positive samples. It is useful when the cost of a false negative is high, as it measures the proportion of truly relevant instances that were identified.

The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics. It is a more comprehensive metric than accuracy, especially for imbalanced datasets, as it takes both false positives and false negatives into account.

In the context of the provided sources, Jarray et al. (2022) used accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the performance of their soil moisture estimation model based on the Eo-Learn framework and machine learning methods. Similarly, Datta et al. (2017) discussed understanding soil water content and thresholds for irrigation management, which could involve evaluating a deep learning model's performance using these metrics.

In summary, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are common metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models for classification purposes, including digital soil mapping and other related fields. These metrics help assess the model's ability to predict relevant instances and balance false positives and false negatives.
