In the context provided, there is no direct mention of strategies used to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, there is a description of how the authors addressed the issue of an unbalanced distribution of deer instances in their dataset. This was done by dividing the dataset into separate subsets based on the number of deer in each image before partitioning it into training, validation, and testing sections. While this is not a method to handle randomness, it is a technique to ensure a more balanced distribution of deer instances across these subsets.

In general, deep learning pipelines may employ various strategies to handle randomness:

1. Fixed random seed value: To ensure reproducibility of results, a fixed random seed value can be set for various operations like weight initialization, shuffling, and dropout. This helps in generating the same set of random numbers across different runs, leading to consistent model training and evaluation.

2. Data shuffling: Shuffling the dataset before splitting it into training, validation, and testing sets can help reduce the impact of any existing order or pattern in the data. This can be done with or without a fixed random seed value.

3. Data augmentation: Techniques like random cropping, rotation, flipping, and scaling can help increase the size of the dataset and introduce variations that can help the model generalize better. These techniques can be applied with a random seed value or following a predefined scheme.

4. Model initialization: Initializing model weights randomly can help the model explore different areas of the weight space during training. Techniques like Xavier initialization or He initialization can help ensure that the weights are initialized with appropriate scales, preventing issues like vanishing or exploding gradients.

5. Regularization techniques: Techniques like dropout, batch normalization, and weight decay can help reduce overfitting by introducing randomness during training. These methods can help the model become more robust and less prone to memorizing the training data.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, techniques like setting a fixed random seed value, data shuffling, data augmentation, model initialization, and regularization can be employed to manage randomness and ensure reproducibility and robustness in deep learning models.
