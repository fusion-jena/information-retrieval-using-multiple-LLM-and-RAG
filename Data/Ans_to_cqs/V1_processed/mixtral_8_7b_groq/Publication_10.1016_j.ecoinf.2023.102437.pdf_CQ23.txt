Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, the text discusses a comparative analysis of hyperparameter optimization approaches for a deep neural network (DNN) in the context of land cover/land use (LCLU) classification. The DNN model is used to classify land cover types, and its performance is compared with other machine learning models.

In general, to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, several measures can be taken, such as:

1. Diverse dataset: Using a diverse and representative dataset that covers various scenarios, land cover types, and environmental conditions can help the model learn a wide range of patterns and relationships.
2. Cross-validation: Splitting the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets and using cross-validation techniques can help assess the model's performance and avoid overfitting.
3. Stratified splitting: When dealing with imbalanced classes, using stratified splitting can ensure that each subset (training, validation, and testing) contains a similar proportion of samples from each class.
4. Regularization: Techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization can be used to prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize.
5. Early stopping: Monitoring the model's performance on the validation set during training and stopping the training process when the performance starts to degrade can help prevent overfitting.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention these measures, it is possible that some of these techniques were applied in the comparative analysis of hyperparameter optimization approaches for the DNN model. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
