The deep learning pipeline in the study discussed uses audio data as the input format. The audio files are first converted into Mel-spectrograms, a signal representation derived from the spectrogram that uses the nonlinear Mel scale. This format is used because it reflects the relationship between frequency and human perceived pitch change more accurately than other methods. After converting the audio files into Mel-spectrograms, they are input into a CNN from Google's AudioSet project, which generates 128 embeddings per second of audio. The mean and standard deviation of these embeddings are then calculated over the entire duration of the great call, resulting in a 256-length feature vector for each call. Therefore, the data format used in this deep learning pipeline is specifically Mel-spectrograms derived from audio files.

It is worth noting that the study also mentions the use of pre-trained models from other sources, such as VGGish, which was trained on a vast YouTube audio dataset, and BirdNET, which was trained on audio data of bird vocalizations. However, these models were not trained on the Mel-spectrograms specifically, but rather on the raw audio data.

In summary, the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline discussed is Mel-spectrograms derived from audio files. Other pre-trained models were used, which were trained on raw audio data from different sources.
