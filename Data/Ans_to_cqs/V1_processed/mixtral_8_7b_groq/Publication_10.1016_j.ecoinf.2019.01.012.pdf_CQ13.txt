The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model include the learning rate and the optimizer. The learning rate, denoted as lr, is set to 0.0001. The optimizer used is the adaptive ADAM (Adaptive Moment Estimation). Other relevant hyperparameters include the use of ReLU activation for the convolutional layers and an exponential linear unit (ELU) activation on the fully connected layer. The model was trained over 16,290 iterations, which is equivalent to 90 epochs, with a batch size of 256. The statistics were performed using R (version 3.3.1). The best model was chosen based on the two parameters accuracy and loss, whereby loss serves as a measure on how far model predictions differ from the actual class. Model accuracy and loss were calculated for both training and validation set. The performance of the final model was tested on two different data sets: 1) on individual tiles and 2) on whole repeat photographs. Prediction accuracy on individual tiles was calculated using the 5796 tiles from the test set, which has been separated from the total number of samples before training. The accuracy on whole repeat photographs was evaluated based on the image pairs of the second set of photographs, and a confusion matrix was prepared for each photograph individually.
