The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models in the given context are precision and recall, as shown in Table 3. The table presents the precision results for each experiment (E1 and E2) and for each pose model (upper, left, and right). Precision is the ratio of true positive predictions (relevant items that are correctly identified) to the total predicted positives (all items identified as relevant). It indicates the proportion of correct positive predictions out of all positive predictions made by the model.

In the context, the authors used Precision@k, where k = {1, 3, 5, 6}. Precision@k calculates the precision at the top k predicted results. For example, Precision@1 measures the precision of the model when only the top predicted result is considered. Similarly, Precision@3 measures the precision of the model when the top three predicted results are considered.

It is important to note that the context does not mention the use of other metrics, such as accuracy or recall. Accuracy is the ratio of correct predictions (both true positives and true negatives) to the total number of predictions. Recall, also known as sensitivity, is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of actual positives.

In summary, the deep learning models in the given context are evaluated using precision metrics, specifically Precision@k, where k = {1, 3, 5, 6}. Other metrics, such as accuracy and recall, are not mentioned in the context.
