The provided context discusses the use of Twitter data for ecological observations and the methodology used to filter and process the data. However, it does not directly mention the data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline.

In general, data annotation techniques for deep learning in computer vision tasks such as object detection and segmentation include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing a rectangle (bounding box) around the object of interest in an image. It is a simple and fast method for annotating data, but it may not be accurate enough for some applications.
2. Instance segmentation: This technique involves segmenting each instance of an object in an image. It provides more precise information about the location and shape of the object than bounding box annotation.
3. Semantic segmentation: This technique involves segmenting an image into regions based on the class label of each pixel. It is useful for applications where the goal is to understand the overall composition of an image, rather than the location and shape of individual objects.

The choice of data annotation technique depends on the specific task and the desired level of accuracy. In the context of ecological observations using Twitter data, it is likely that instance segmentation or semantic segmentation would be more appropriate for annotating images of species, as they would provide more precise information about the location and extent of the species in the image.

However, the provided context does not mention the use of images in the Twitter data or the specific deep learning pipeline used for ecological observations. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to the query based on the given information.
