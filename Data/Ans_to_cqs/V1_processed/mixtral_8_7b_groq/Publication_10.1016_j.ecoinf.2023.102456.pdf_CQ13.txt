The provided context discusses the use of the Gumbel softmax function in a machine learning model, but it does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. However, it is possible to infer some common hyperparameters that might be used in this context.

The learning rate is a common hyperparameter used in deep learning models. It determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function. The choice of learning rate can significantly affect the training process and the final performance of the model.

Another hyperparameter is the choice of optimizer. Optimizers are algorithms that update the parameters of the model based on the gradient of the loss function. Some common optimizers include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop.

The context also mentions the use of the Gumbel softmax function, which is a continuous relaxation of discrete random variables. This function is used to optimize neural networks involving discrete variables, such as those used in reinforcement learning and generative models. Therefore, it is possible that hyperparameters related to this function, such as temperature parameter τ, might be used in the model.

In addition, the context discusses a neural network architecture that learns the neighborhood relationship Rk to improve the results of the model. Hyperparameters related to this architecture, such as the number of layers or the number of neurons in each layer, might also be used.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, it is possible to infer some common hyperparameters that might be used, such as learning rate, optimizer, temperature parameter τ, and hyperparameters related to the neural network architecture.

Another important hyperparameter to consider is the number of training epochs, which determines the number of times the learning algorithm will work through the entire training dataset. Additionally, regularization techniques such as L1 and L2 regularization or dropout rates might also be used as hyperparameters to prevent overfitting.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, it is possible to infer some common hyperparameters that might be used, such as learning rate, optimizer, temperature parameter τ, and hyperparameters related to the neural network architecture. Other hyperparameters to consider include the number of training epochs, regularization techniques, and batch size.
