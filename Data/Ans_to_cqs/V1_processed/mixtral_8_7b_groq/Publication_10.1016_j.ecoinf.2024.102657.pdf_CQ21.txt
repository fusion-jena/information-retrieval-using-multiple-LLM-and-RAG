Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about specific postprocessing steps that were taken after the model training. However, it does mention that the accuracy of the CNN model was calculated on both noise-filtered and raw data. This implies that metrics calculation was at least one of the postprocessing steps.

In addition, the context mentions that the goal was to demonstrate the power of human-machine teaming by doing the least amount of preprocessing possible. Therefore, it is likely that extensive postprocessing was not performed.

That being said, there are some common postprocessing steps that are often used in machine learning models, especially in the context of classification tasks such as this one. These can include:

1. Saliency maps: These are a way to visualize the parts of the input data that the model is paying attention to when making its predictions. They can be useful for understanding how the model is making its decisions and for identifying any potential biases or weaknesses in the model.

2. Confusion matrix: This is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification model by comparing the predicted labels to the actual labels. It can help to identify which classes the model is having trouble distinguishing between, and can be used to calculate various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

3. Hyperparameter tuning: This involves adjusting the parameters of the model (such as the learning rate, regularization strength, or number of hidden layers) in order to improve its performance. This is typically done during the training phase, but can also be considered a postprocessing step.

Without more information, it is difficult to say for sure which of these steps (if any) were taken in this particular case. However, based on the provided context, it seems likely that metrics calculation was at least one of the postprocessing steps.
