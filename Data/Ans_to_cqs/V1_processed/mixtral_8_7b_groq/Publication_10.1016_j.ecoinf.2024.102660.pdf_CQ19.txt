The Res_AUNet network was constructed using the PyTorch library. This information is provided in section 2.5 of the context, which discusses the parameter setting for the network. It states that "The Res_AUNet network was constructed using the PyTorch library." Therefore, PyTorch is the framework that was used to build the deep learning model in this case.
