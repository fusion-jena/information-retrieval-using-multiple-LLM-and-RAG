Based on the provided context, there are no specific preprocessing steps mentioned for the training of the deep learning models. However, it is generally common practice to perform certain preprocessing techniques on the data before training a deep learning model. These techniques can include data normalization, scaling, and cleaning.

Data normalization is the process of scaling the data to a smaller range, such as between 0 and 1, to prevent any one feature from having a disproportionately large influence on the model. This can be done using various methods such as min-max scaling or z-score normalization.

Scaling is another preprocessing technique that is used to adjust the range of features so that they are on a similar scale. This can help to improve the training process by preventing certain features from dominating the model.

Cleaning the data is also an important preprocessing step, as it can help to remove any noise or outliers that may be present in the data. This can be done through various methods such as imputation, where missing values are replaced with estimated values, or by removing outlier data points that may be skewing the model.

In the provided context, it is mentioned that the deep learning models were initialized with pre-trained weights based on the ImageNet dataset. This means that the models were pre-trained on a large dataset of images, which can help to improve their performance on new, unseen data.

Furthermore, it is mentioned that the models were trained using a Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer and an MSE loss function. These are common choices for training deep learning models, but the specific choice of optimizer and loss function can depend on the specific problem and dataset being used.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention any preprocessing steps, it is common practice to perform data normalization, scaling, and cleaning before training a deep learning model. Additionally, the use of pre-trained weights and specific choices of optimizer and loss function can also impact the training process.
