The provided context does not contain information about the specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model for image segmentation and classification. The text discusses the use of machine learning techniques in eCognition for image classification and mentions that new methods are being developed. However, it does not go into detail about the specific hyperparameters of the deep learning models being used.

Hyperparameters in deep learning models are important as they can have a significant impact on the performance of the model. Examples of hyperparameters that are commonly adjusted include the learning rate, the type of optimizer, the number of layers in the model, and the number of units in each layer.

In general, the learning rate controls how much the model's weights are adjusted during training. A high learning rate may cause the model to converge too quickly to a suboptimal solution, while a low learning rate may cause the model to train too slowly. The type of optimizer used can also affect the training of the model. Common optimizers include stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop.

The number of layers and the number of units in each layer are other important hyperparameters. Increasing the number of layers and units can allow the model to learn more complex patterns, but it can also increase the risk of overfitting.

In summary, while the provided context discusses the use of machine learning techniques for image classification, it does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning models. Hyperparameters such as the learning rate, optimizer, number of layers, and number of units are important for the performance of deep learning models.
