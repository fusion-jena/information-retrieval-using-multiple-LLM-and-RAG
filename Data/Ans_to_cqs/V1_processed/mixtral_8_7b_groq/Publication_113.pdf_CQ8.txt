The provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The text describes a deep active learning system for species identification and counting in camera trap images, but it does not mention where the code for this system is available. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query. It is possible that the code has not been made publicly available, or it may be hosted on a platform other than GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. If you are interested in the code, I would recommend contacting the authors of the paper for more information.
