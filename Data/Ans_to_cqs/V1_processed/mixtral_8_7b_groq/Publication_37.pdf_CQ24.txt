Based on the provided context, there are a few strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, the use of a random seed value is not explicitly mentioned.

Firstly, the model uses stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for optimization, which involves a degree of randomness through the selection of mini-batches for each training iteration. While the context does not mention the use of a fixed seed value for this process, it is common practice to set a seed value to ensure reproducibility of results.

Secondly, dropout is applied to the input of the last two layers with a probability of 0.5. Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly drops out a proportion of neurons during training, which helps to prevent overfitting. Again, while the context does not specify a seed value for this process, it is typically recommended to set a seed value for dropout to ensure consistent results.

Thirdly, L2-regularization is applied to the weights of the last two layers with a penalty factor of 0.001. L2-regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. This encourages the model to learn smaller weight values, which can help to prevent overfitting. The use of a seed value is not relevant for L2-regularization.

Finally, the model is trained for 100 epochs and checkpointed after each epoch. While the context does not explicitly mention the use of a seed value for this process, it is common practice to set a seed value for the random number generator used during training to ensure reproducibility of results.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it is common practice to set seed values for stochastic processes such as mini-batch selection, dropout, and checkpointing. However, the specific implementation details for the model described in the context are not provided, so it is not possible to say for certain whether a seed value was used.
