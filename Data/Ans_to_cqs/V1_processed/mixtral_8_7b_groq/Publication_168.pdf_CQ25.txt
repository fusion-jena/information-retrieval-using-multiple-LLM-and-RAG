The purpose of the deep learning model in the given context is for forest species classification using hyperspectral images (HSI) obtained from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The model is designed to accurately identify and distinguish different tree species based on their unique spectral signatures, which are essentially detailed reflectance patterns across various wavelengths.

The deep learning model used in this study is a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1-D-CNN), which is specifically tailored to extract features from the spectral dimension of the HSI data. The model consists of a convolution operation, a pooling operation, and a fully connected operation. The convolution operation helps in extracting low-level features from the input data, while the pooling operation reduces the spatial dimensions of the data, thus helping to control overfitting and reduce computational complexity. The fully connected operation then combines these features to make a final classification decision.

The primary goal of this deep learning model is to address the challenge of limited training data in HSI classification tasks. The authors designed a simple yet effective 1-D-CNN model that can achieve satisfactory classification performance even with a relatively small amount of training data. This is particularly important for HSI classification tasks, where acquiring large labeled datasets can be time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive.

In summary, the deep learning model discussed in the provided context is specifically designed for forest species classification using hyperspectral images from UAVs. The 1-D-CNN model focuses on extracting relevant features from the spectral dimension of the HSI data, and it is tailored to address the challenge of limited training data in HSI classification tasks.
