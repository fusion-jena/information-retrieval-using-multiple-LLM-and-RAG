I'm sorry, but the provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the use of machine learning, specifically random forests, for multi-layer classification to identify areas affected by wildfires. It mentions the use of various hyperparameters and evaluation metrics but does not provide any details about the code repository. Therefore, I'm unable to provide an answer to this query.
