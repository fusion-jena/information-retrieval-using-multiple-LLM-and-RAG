The provided context does not give specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention several data sources that were used in the study.

The data sources include Open Spatial Demographic Data and Research, Resource and Environment Science and Data Center, National Meteorological Science Data Center, Harmonized World Soil Database, and Geospatial Data Cloud. These sources likely provide public datasets that were used in the study.

Additionally, the study used ArcGIS10.5 software for data preprocessing, which suggests that the raw data may have been in a geographic information system (GIS) format. GIS data can come from various sources, such as satellite imagery, aerial photography, and field surveys.

The study also used indicators such as population density, economic density, land use intensity, precipitation, temperature, evapotranspiration, soil type, elevation, slope, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), and vegetation type. These indicators suggest that the raw data may have been collected using methods such as remote sensing, weather sensors, and soil sampling.

Overall, while the provided context does not give specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data, it suggests that the study used a combination of public datasets, GIS data, and possibly remote sensing and weather sensors for data collection.
