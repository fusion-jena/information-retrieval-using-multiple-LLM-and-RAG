The provided context does not give specific information about the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some preprocessing techniques used in the SPG framework for processing point cloud data.

The SPG framework involves a hand-crafted point cloud partition, where each partition is converted into a superpoint. The network for superpoint embedding and segmentation is based on PointNet and GRU. The linearity, planarity, and scattering of the adjacency are derived to represent the geometric features of the point cloud.

In the context, the authors have mentioned adjusting the training epoch, batch size, and volume size during model training. However, these techniques are more related to optimizing the model's performance rather than addressing data bias.

In the literature, some common techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Stratified splitting involves dividing the data into subgroups based on certain characteristics and then randomly sampling from each subgroup to ensure that each subgroup is represented in the training and testing sets. Oversampling involves increasing the number of samples from underrepresented groups, while undersampling involves decreasing the number of samples from overrepresented groups. Diverse data collection involves collecting data from various sources and ensuring that the data is representative of the population.

Without more specific information about the preprocessing techniques used in the SPG framework, it is difficult to say whether any of these techniques were used to address data bias. Therefore, I would say that I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
