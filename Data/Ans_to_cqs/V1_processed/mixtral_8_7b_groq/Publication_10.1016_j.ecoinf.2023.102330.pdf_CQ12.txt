A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is used in the pipeline for acoustic detection. This is evident from the context provided, which mentions the use of a "covey call acoustic CNN" that has been trained to detect and localize all covey calls per ARU (Automated Recording Unit) during the recording period. The model is trained to note the associated time and peak power (dB) of each detected covey call. Additionally, the model used in the pipeline is a previously developed CNN model trained on covey call spectrogram data collected separately to this study from Di-Lane and other sites around Georgia and Alabama, USA. Therefore, it can be concluded that a CNN model is used in the pipeline for acoustic detection.
