The provided context does not give specific information about how the raw data was collected for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. However, it can be inferred that the raw data consists of images of plant leaves, and it is likely that the images were collected using cameras or scanners.

The study mentions that an augmented version of the PlanVillage dataset was used, which suggests that the original dataset was publicly available. Public datasets are a common source of raw data for deep learning applications, as they provide a large and diverse set of examples that can be used for training and testing models.

In addition to public datasets, raw data for deep learning pipelines can also be collected through surveys or sensors. Surveys can be used to gather data from a large number of participants, while sensors can be used to collect data in real-time from the environment.

Overall, the specific method of data collection is not provided in the context, but it is likely that the raw data was collected through a combination of publicly available datasets and images collected using cameras or scanners.
