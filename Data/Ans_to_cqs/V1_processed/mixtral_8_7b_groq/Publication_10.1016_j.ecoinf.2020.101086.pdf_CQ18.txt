Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, the text does discuss the evaluation of the models after training through comparison with other methods.

The study presents a new sampling bias effect correction method and compares it with other representative approaches of the literature. The performance of these methods is evaluated using absolute evaluation and relative evaluation indexes. The relative evaluation indexes show a variation in ranking according to the number of presence sites. No correction method appears to be the best one, but when focusing on a small number of presence sites, BGenv consistently achieves the first or second rank, regardless of the evaluation index used.

The study also mentions that the relative ranking of each method varies by correction type and the number of presence sites. For instance, when the number of presence sites is 20, Fenv is the best method for ΔDenv, while BGenv provides the best results when the number of presence sites is 50. Similarly, when the number of presence sites increases, BGgeo is ranked the best for ΔAUC, BGgeo and Fenv for ΔDenv, and Fgeo for ΔDgeo.

Therefore, while there is no information on monitoring the model performance during training, the study does provide a comprehensive evaluation of the models after training through relative and absolute evaluation indexes.
