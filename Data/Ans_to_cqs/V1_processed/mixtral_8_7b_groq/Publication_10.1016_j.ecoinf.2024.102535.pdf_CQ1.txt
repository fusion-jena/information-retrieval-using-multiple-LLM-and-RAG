The text provided does not give specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for hydrothermal vent environments. However, it does mention the use of optical imagery datasets and large-scale temporal habitat maps. Therefore, it can be inferred that surveys using cameras or other optical imaging devices are likely used for data collection. Additionally, public datasets of hydrothermal vent images may also be used. Furthermore, the context of the paper suggests that the data is collected in a marine environment, possibly using underwater vehicles or submersibles equipped with imaging sensors. But, the text does not provide explicit information on the data collection methods.
