The provided context discusses the hyperparameter tuning process for various prediction models, including a deep learning model called MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron). However, the specific hyperparameters for the MLP model are not explicitly listed in the text. Therefore, I cannot provide a precise answer to your question.

However, based on common practice and the context, I can give you an idea of some typical hyperparameters used in deep learning models like MLP:

1. Learning rate: This is a common hyperparameter in deep learning models, which controls the step size during gradient descent.
2. Number of layers and number of neurons per layer: These parameters define the architecture of the MLP model.
3. Activation functions: These functions are used to introduce non-linearity in the model. Common activation functions include ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), sigmoid, and tanh.
4. Regularization parameters: These hyperparameters, such as L1 and L2 regularization, help prevent overfitting.
5. Optimizer: This is an algorithm used to update the model's weights based on the gradient. Common optimizers include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop.

Since the exact hyperparameters for the MLP model in the provided context are not specified, I encourage you to refer to the original source or consult the documentation for the deep learning library or framework used in the study for more accurate information.
