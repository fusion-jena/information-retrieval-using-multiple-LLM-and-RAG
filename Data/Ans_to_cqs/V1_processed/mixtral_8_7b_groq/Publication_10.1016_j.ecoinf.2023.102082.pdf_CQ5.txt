The deep learning pipeline for creating the Lang10m high-resolution canopy height model (CHM) of the Earth involves using Sentinel-2 optical images and a deep learning approach involving convolutional neural networks. The model was created for a study that aimed to assess biodiversity patterns in forest ecosystems by estimating the height to highest foliage (HH) which is correlated to tree species diversity.

The study tested the approach separately in 30 forest plots situated in the northern Italian Alps, in 100 plots in the forested area of Traunstein in Germany, and successively in all the 130 plots through a cross-validation analysis. Forest density information was also included as an influencing factor in a multiple regression analysis.

The results of the study showed that the GEDI CHMs can be used to assess biodiversity patterns in forest ecosystems through the estimation of the HH that is correlated to the tree species diversity. However, the study also indicated that this method is influenced by different factors including the GEDI CHMs dataset of choice and their related spatial resolution, the heterogeneity indices used to calculate the HH, and the forest density.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the deep learning pipeline for creating the Lang10m CHM likely involved training a convolutional neural network on Sentinel-2 optical images, potentially in combination with other data such as GEDI CHMs and forest density information. The model was then validated using data from forest plots in the northern Italian Alps and Germany.

However, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. It is possible that the pipeline used a custom dataset created from the Sentinel-2 images and GEDI CHMs.
