The provided context does not contain information about the use of any deep learning models in the study. The classification methods mentioned are Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS). These are traditional machine learning algorithms, not deep learning models. Therefore, the text does not provide information about the hardware resources, such as GPUs or TPUs, used for training deep learning models.
