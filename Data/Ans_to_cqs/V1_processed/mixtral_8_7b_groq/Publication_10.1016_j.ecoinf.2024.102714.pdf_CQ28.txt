The provided context does not mention which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. The text discusses the use of the XGBoostClassifier, a Python implementation of the XGBoost algorithm, to classify very high-resolution (VHR) images and generate habitat maps. However, it does not specify where this model was deployed. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query.
