The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific deep learning frameworks used to build the models. However, it is mentioned that a Microsoft Sponsorship supported Azure-based development and model deployment in Whiskerbook.org. Azure is a cloud computing service provided by Microsoft, which can support various deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and MXNet. Therefore, it is possible that any of these popular deep learning frameworks were used in this study. Nonetheless, without more specific information, it is not possible to give a definitive answer.
