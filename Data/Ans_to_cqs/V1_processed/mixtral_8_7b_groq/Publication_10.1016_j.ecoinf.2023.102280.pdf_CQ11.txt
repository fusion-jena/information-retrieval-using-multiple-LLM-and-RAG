Based on the provided context, there is no specific link to a data repository for the deep learning pipeline mentioned. The context discusses various papers and studies related to deep learning-based denoising methods for natural language processing and bioacoustic applications. However, it does not mention or provide a link to a specific data repository for a deep learning pipeline.

The paper by Defossez et al. (2020) demonstrated state-of-the-art deep noise reduction techniques, but the context does not provide a link to their data. Similarly, the paper by Sainburg et al. (2020) discusses finding, visualizing, and quantifying latent structure across diverse animal vocal repertoires, but there is no link to their data in the provided context.

The paper by Stowell (2021) provides a review and roadmap for computational bioacoustics with deep learning, but again, there is no mention of a specific data repository for a deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to a data repository for the deep learning pipeline based on the given context.
