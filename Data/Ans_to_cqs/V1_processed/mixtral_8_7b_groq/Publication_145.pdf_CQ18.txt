In summary, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using a validation dataset, tracking the segmentation of objects, and using a custom loss function that includes binary cross-entropy and a Dice coefficient-related loss of the three predicted masks. The model was trained for 300 epochs with a batch size of 24 images, and the training took place on an Nvidia RTX2080 graphics card with 8 GB of dedicated memory.
