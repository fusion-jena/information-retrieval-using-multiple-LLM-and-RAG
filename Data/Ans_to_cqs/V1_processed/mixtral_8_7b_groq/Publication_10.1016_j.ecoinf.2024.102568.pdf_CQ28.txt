The provided context does not give information about which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. The context mentions the use of a deep learning algorithm called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for real-time sensor calibration in the HypeAIR framework, but it does not specify where this model was deployed. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
