The provided context discusses various machine learning algorithms and their application in classifying animal behavior, but it does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training. However, it is common practice in machine learning to split data into three sets: training, validation, and testing.

The training set is used to train the model, i.e., to adjust the model's parameters to minimize the error on the training data. The validation set is used during the training process to provide an unbiased evaluation of the model's performance. This is important because overfitting can occur if the model is only evaluated on the training data. Overfitting is when the model performs well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data. The validation set helps to mitigate this by providing an estimate of the model's performance on new data.

The testing set is used at the end of the training process to provide a final, unbiased evaluation of the model's performance. This is important because the validation set has been used during the training process and is therefore not truly unseen data.

The criteria used to split the data can vary depending on the specific problem and the amount of available data. A common approach is to use 60% of the data for training, 20% for validation, and 20% for testing. However, if the amount of data is limited, it might be necessary to use a larger proportion of the data for training and a smaller proportion for validation and testing.

In the context of deep learning, the same principles apply. The data is split into training, validation, and testing sets. The training set is used to adjust the model's parameters, the validation set is used to provide an unbiased evaluation during the training process, and the testing set is used to provide a final, unbiased evaluation of the model's performance.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training, it is common practice in machine learning to split data into training, validation, and testing sets. The criteria used to split the data can vary depending on the specific problem and the amount of available data.
