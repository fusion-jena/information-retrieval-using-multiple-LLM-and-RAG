Based on the provided context, there is no information about a deep learning pipeline or its code repository in GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other platform. The context consists of academic papers and articles related to topics such as species distribution, vegetation and climate change, drought tolerance, and the Neolithic period. While these studies may involve computational methods and data analysis, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or its code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information.
