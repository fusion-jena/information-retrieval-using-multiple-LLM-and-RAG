Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, there are some indications of possible techniques that might have been employed to enhance the model's generalizability.

First, the study used a combination of spectral, NDVI, and date features, which could have helped the model capture a variety of patterns and relationships within the data. Additionally, the researchers calculated average and entropy values of each spectral band and NDVI within a window across multiple window sizes. This approach might have allowed the model to learn features at different scales and increased its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

Second, the researchers addressed the issue of slow processing due to structures like roads, buildings, and water by reducing the average number of pixels per scene the classification model had to analyze. This preprocessing step could have helped improve the model's performance by reducing noise and focusing on relevant features.

Lastly, the context mentions two tables (A.5 and A.6) that provide accuracy metrics for models using different feature sets and window sizes. While these tables do not directly show the use of techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting, they do demonstrate that the researchers evaluated the models' performance using various configurations. This iterative process could have indirectly contributed to the model's generalizability by helping the researchers identify and address potential overfitting or biases in the model.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly state the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, there are indications that the researchers used a variety of features, preprocessing steps, and model evaluations that might have contributed to the model's ability to generalize to new data. However, without more specific information, it is not possible to definitively answer this query.
