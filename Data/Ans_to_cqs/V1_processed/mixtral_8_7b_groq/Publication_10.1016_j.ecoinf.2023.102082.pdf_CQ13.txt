The provided context does not give specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model for creating the Lang10m high-resolution CHM of the Earth. The text mentions the use of a deep learning approach, specifically convolutional neural networks, for fusing Sentinel-2 optical images and GEDI LiDAR data. However, it does not provide details about the learning rate, optimizer, or any other hyperparameters used in the model. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query based on the given context.
