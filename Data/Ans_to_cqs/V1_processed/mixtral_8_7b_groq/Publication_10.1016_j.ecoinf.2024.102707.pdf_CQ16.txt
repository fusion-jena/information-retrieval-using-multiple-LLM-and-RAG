Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it is common practice in machine learning to use a variety of methods to assess model convergence and prevent overfitting.

One common approach is monitoring validation loss or metrics like F1 score during training. If the validation loss or F1 score does not improve for a certain number of epochs, or if it starts to degrade, training can be stopped. This is often referred to as early stopping. The context provided mentions F1 scores for the training, validation, and test datasets, but it does not explicitly mention early stopping or validation loss plateaus.

Another approach is setting a maximum number of epochs or iterations for the training process. This ensures that training will stop even if the model has not yet converged. The context does not provide information about a maximum number of epochs being used.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, it is common practice to use methods such as early stopping and setting a maximum number of epochs. However, without further information, it is not possible to definitively answer this query.
