The provided context does not contain specific information about the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training. However, it is common practice in machine learning to split data into three subsets: training, validation, and testing.

The training set is used to train the model by adjusting the model's parameters to minimize the error on the training data. The validation set is used during the training process to provide an unbiased evaluation of the model's performance. The validation set helps to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, and performs poorly on new, unseen data.

The testing set, which is independent of both the training and validation sets, is used to evaluate the final performance of the trained model. The testing set provides an unbiased estimate of how the model will generalize to new data.

The splitting criteria can vary depending on the specific problem and dataset. Commonly, the data is split randomly into three subsets, with a ratio such as 60% for training, 20% for validation, and 20% for testing. In some cases, stratified sampling is used to ensure that each subset contains a representative proportion of the different classes in the dataset.

In the context of predicting potential natural vegetation (PNV) using machine learning methods, the data splitting criteria would depend on the specific dataset and the research question. The authors in Hengl et al. (2018) evaluated different machine learning methods for global PNV mapping in a classification setting, but they did not provide details about the data splitting criteria used in their study.

In summary, while the provided context does not contain specific information about the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training, it is common practice to use a training set, a validation set, and a testing set. The splitting criteria can vary depending on the specific problem and dataset, with random splitting or stratified sampling being commonly used methods.
