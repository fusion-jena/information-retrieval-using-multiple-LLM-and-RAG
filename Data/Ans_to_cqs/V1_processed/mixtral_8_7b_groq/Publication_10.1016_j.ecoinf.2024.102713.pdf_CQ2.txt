Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline in question uses various data formats. However, the text does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, we can only infer the data formats from the context.

The context mentions four data sources: a monitoring network, satellite images, weather data, and environment data. The monitoring network data is loaded with a weekly frequency and a monitoring task granularity, suggesting that it might be in a structured format such as CSV or a proprietary format specific to the monitoring network. Satellite images are typically provided in raster formats such as GeoTIFF or JPEG 2000, and the text mentions a 100 km2 granule, which further supports this inference.

Weather data is provided daily, and the text does not mention the granularity of this data source. However, weather data is often provided in a structured format such as CSV or JSON, containing measurements for various environmental elements. Similarly, environment data is provided yearly, and the text mentions the granularity as an environmental element, suggesting that it might be in a structured format.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we can infer that the deep learning pipeline uses raster formats such as GeoTIFF or JPEG 2000 for satellite images, and structured formats such as CSV or a proprietary format for monitoring network data, and potentially JSON or CSV for weather and environment data. However, this is an inference based on the provided context, and the text does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.
