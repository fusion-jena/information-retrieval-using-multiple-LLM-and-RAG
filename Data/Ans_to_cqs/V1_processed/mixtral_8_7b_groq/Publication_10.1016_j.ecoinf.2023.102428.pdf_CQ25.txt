The purpose of the deep learning model used in the study is land use/land cover (LULC) simulation. This is evident in the model description where it is stated that the model integrates the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) algorithm and Markov chain for robust future LULC simulation (Gebresellase et al., 2023; Nasiri et al., 2019). The model utilizes deep machine learning to learn the model in automated mode in less calibration time through complex, multivariate, and non-linear relationships to create several transitions and predict unseen data within the model at a single time by comprehending the hidden relationships (Kumar and Agrawal, 2023).

The MLP algorithm used in this model is a prevalent machine learning algorithm in artificial neural network (ANN) modeling, which uses back propagation or the reverse method of automatic differentiation as a feedforward propagation algorithm to train the neural networks by employing supervised learning based on stochastic gradient descent (SGD) (Kumar and Agrawal, 2023). The model consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. The input data is provided to the input node, processed through the hidden layers in an iterative manner, and the output layer provides the pattern classification.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the deep learning model is used for the purpose of land use/land cover simulation, specifically for predicting and understanding the complex, multivariate, and non-linear relationships that exist in land use/land cover data.
