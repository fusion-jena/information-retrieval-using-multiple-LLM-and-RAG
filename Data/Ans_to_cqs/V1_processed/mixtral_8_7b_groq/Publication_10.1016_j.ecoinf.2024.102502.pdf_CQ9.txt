The provided context does not give information about a specific deep learning pipeline or its data repository. However, it does mention the use of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform for processing and storing Earth Observation System (EOS) data. GEE is a cloud computing platform that can handle large volumes of data and has the capacity to store data from multiple satellites. It also provides big data fast computation, which is useful for processing EOS data that often includes hundreds or thousands of scenes.

While the context does not explicitly mention the use of a deep learning pipeline in conjunction with GEE, it is possible to use deep learning techniques on GEE. Google has provided a tutorial on how to use deep learning on GEE using TensorFlow.js, a JavaScript library for training and deploying machine learning models in the browser.

As for the data repository, the context mentions that EOS data can be retrieved from the GEE online repository. However, it does not specify whether the deep learning pipeline's data repository is available on Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. It is possible that the data repository is hosted on GEE or another cloud computing platform, or it may be available on one of the repositories mentioned. Without more information about the deep learning pipeline, it is difficult to determine the location of its data repository.
