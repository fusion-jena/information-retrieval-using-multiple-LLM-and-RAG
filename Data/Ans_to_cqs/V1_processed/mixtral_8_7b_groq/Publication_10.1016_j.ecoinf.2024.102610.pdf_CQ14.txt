The context provided does not give information on how the hyperparameters of the model, such as those of the random forest, are optimized. There is no mention of methods like grid search, random search, or other techniques used for tuning the hyperparameters of the models employed in the studies.

The text focuses on the importance of selecting appropriate parameters and variable elimination methods when constructing predictive models, specifically for tsetse fly habitat modeling. It discusses two common variable elimination techniques, RFE (Recursive Feature Elimination) and VSURF (Variable Selection Using Random Forests), and how they retain variables based on their importance and contribution to prediction error reduction. However, it does not mention any hyperparameter optimization methods.

In summary, based on the given context, the hyperparameters of the models are not optimized using grid search, random search, or any other specific methods.
