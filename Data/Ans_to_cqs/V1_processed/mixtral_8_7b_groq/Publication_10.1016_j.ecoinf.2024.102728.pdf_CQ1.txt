The raw data for the deep learning pipeline in the study described is collected using various methods, including archaeological surveys, remote sensing, and the use of public datasets.

The archaeological survey data from the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) is one of the primary data sources used in the study. This data is collected through on-ground surveys and provides information about land use and land cover (LTA-LU) in the study area.

Remote sensing is another major data source used in the study. This includes data from the spaceborne Vegetation and Environment Monitoring on a New Micro Satellite (VENÎ¼S), airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) sensors. Remote sensing provides a way to collect data over large areas and can be used to gather information about the physical characteristics of the land, such as vegetation, topography, and geology.

Additional ancillary data is required for establishing research control, georeferencing, and masking disturbed areas. This includes digital maps from the Israeli Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) for modern LU/LC, georegistered orthophotos from the Survey of Israel (SOI) for georeferencing and masking the study area, substrate data for geology from the Israel geological survey (I.G.S.), and climate-related data from the Israel Meteorological Service (I.M.S.) and the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

The study also uses public datasets, such as the Geographic Information System Software (QGIS) and the Survey of Israel's Geospatial Portal. These datasets provide a wealth of information that can be used in the deep learning pipeline, including geographical data, maps, and imagery.

In summary, the raw data for the deep learning pipeline in this study is collected through a combination of archaeological surveys, remote sensing, and the use of public datasets. These methods provide a comprehensive and diverse set of data that can be used to train and validate deep learning models.
