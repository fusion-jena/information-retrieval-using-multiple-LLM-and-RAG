The provided context does not give specific details about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline for reconstructing caesium-137 chronics particulate concentration in rivers. However, it is mentioned that an encoder-decoder neural network, "Hierarchical Attention-Based Recurrent Highway Networks" (HRHN), is used for this purpose. This implies that the input data is likely in a format that can be processed by this type of network.

Typically, encoder-decoder architectures are used for sequence-to-sequence tasks, such as machine translation, where the input and output data are both sequences of tokens (e.g., words, characters, or subwords). In this case, the input data is likely a time series of caesium-137 concentration measurements, possibly accompanied by other relevant environmental variables. These measurements could be represented as a CSV file, where each row contains a timestamp and the corresponding concentration value(s).

Additionally, the HRHN architecture incorporates convolutional neural network (CNN) layers, which are commonly used for processing image, audio, and video data. However, there is no mention in the context that these types of data are used in this particular deep learning pipeline.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly state the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline for reconstructing caesium-137 chronics particulate concentration in rivers, it is likely that the input data is in a time series format, such as a CSV file.
