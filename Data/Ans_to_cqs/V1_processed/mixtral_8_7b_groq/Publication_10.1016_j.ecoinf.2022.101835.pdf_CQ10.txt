Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context includes details about the methods and techniques used, such as the use of the TensorFlow library for building the deep learning model, but it does not provide a link to the code repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide the requested link to the code repository.
