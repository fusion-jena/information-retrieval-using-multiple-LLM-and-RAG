The context does not provide specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. It mentions that the models were trained, and the training time was measured on a Lenovo Legion Y520 with Linux Mint 20.2 Cinnamon Edition operating system. However, it does not explicitly state whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware accelerators were used for training. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
