The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for fish classification by species are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that a residual neural network was pre-trained with the ImageNet dataset for the classification task. ImageNet is a large-scale dataset that contains over 14 million images belonging to 1000 categories, and it is commonly used for object recognition tasks.

Furthermore, the pipeline involved two main tasks: fish segmentation and fish classification. The fish segmentation task involved the use of unannotated fishing sets, and the segmentation model was trained using manually annotated segments and data augmentation techniques. The segmentation model was used to identify individual fishes in the fishing sets, and the resulting segments were used for the fish classification task.

The fish classification task involved the use of two trained models, and the ResNet50V2 model was pre-trained with the ImageNet dataset. The classification model was used to predict the species of the individual fishes identified in the fish segmentation task.

Therefore, while the exact datasets used in the fish segmentation task are not specified, it can be inferred that the pipeline involved the use of the ImageNet dataset for pre-training the classification model.
