Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after training the BirdNET model for bird species identification. However, the context does mention some metrics that were calculated during the evaluation of the model's performance.

The evaluation metrics mentioned in the context are classification accuracy and Normalized Mutual Information (NMI). Classification accuracy is a common metric for evaluating the performance of classification models. It is calculated as the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions. Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) is a metric used to evaluate the similarity between two clusterings. It is a normalization of the Mutual Information (MI) that measures the amount of information that one clustering contains about the other.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of confidence intervals in the figures presented. Confidence intervals are a way to express the uncertainty associated with a point estimate of a population parameter. They provide a range of values that are likely to contain the true population parameter with a certain level of confidence.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention any postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or a confusion matrix, it does mention the calculation of evaluation metrics and the use of confidence intervals. These are common postprocessing steps in the evaluation of machine learning models.
