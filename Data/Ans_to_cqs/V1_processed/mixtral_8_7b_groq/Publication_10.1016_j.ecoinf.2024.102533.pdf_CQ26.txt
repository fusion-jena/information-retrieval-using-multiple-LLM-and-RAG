The provided context discusses the data normalization stage, clustering methods, and evaluation of clustering results but does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer based on the given context.

However, I can give you a general overview of techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing:

1. Stratified sampling: This technique ensures that the train and test datasets have approximately the same percentage of samples of each target variable class as the original dataset. This helps maintain balance and avoid bias in the data.

2. Oversampling: In cases where one class is underrepresented, oversampling can be used to balance the dataset by replicating samples from the minority class. However, this may lead to overfitting, and techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) can be used instead.

3. Undersampling: When the majority class is overrepresented, undersampling can be used to balance the dataset by removing samples from the majority class. This technique, however, may result in loss of valuable information.

4. Diverse data collection: Collecting data from various sources, under different conditions, and ensuring representation from different demographics can help reduce bias in the dataset.

5. Data augmentation: This technique generates new synthetic samples from the existing data, increasing the dataset size and introducing more variability. It can help improve model performance and reduce bias.

6. Reject option classification: In cases where the model is uncertain about a sample's class, the reject option classification technique can be used to abstain from making a prediction. This can help reduce the number of incorrect predictions and bias.

7. Fairness-aware machine learning: This approach involves incorporating fairness constraints during model training to minimize bias and ensure equitable treatment of all classes or demographics.
