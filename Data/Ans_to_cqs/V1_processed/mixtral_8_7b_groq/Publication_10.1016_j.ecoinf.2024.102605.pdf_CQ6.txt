Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved, including normalization, scaling, and cleaning. These steps are crucial to ensure the quality of the data and improve the performance of the model.

Normalization is the process of scaling numeric data to a range of [0, 1] or mean = 0, standard deviation = 1. This is important because deep learning models are sensitive to the scale of the input features. If the features have different scales, the model may give more importance to the features with larger scales, which can negatively impact the performance of the model. Normalization can be done using various techniques such as min-max scaling, z-score scaling, or decimal scaling.

Scaling is similar to normalization, but it scales the data to a specific range, usually [-1, 1] or [+/-1 standard deviation]. Scaling is useful when the data has a natural origin, and it is important to preserve this information. For example, when working with images, it is common to scale the pixel values to [0, 255] or [-1, 1] to preserve the contrast and brightness information.

Cleaning is the process of removing noise, outliers, and missing values from the data. Noise can come from various sources, such as sensor errors, data acquisition artifacts, or data transmission errors. Outliers are data points that are significantly different from the rest of the data and can negatively impact the performance of the model. Missing values can occur due to various reasons, such as data corruption, data loss, or data incompleteness. Cleaning the data is important because it ensures that the model is trained on high-quality data, which can improve the performance and generalization of the model.

In addition to these preprocessing steps, it is also common to perform feature engineering, which involves extracting relevant features from the data that can improve the performance of the model. Feature engineering can be done using various techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), or independent component analysis (ICA).

In summary, before training a deep learning model, it is important to perform preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning to ensure the quality of the data and improve the performance of the model. Additionally, feature engineering can be performed to extract relevant features from the data that can further improve the performance of the model.
