The provided context does not contain information about the specific deep learning frameworks used in the study. The study focuses on the use of supervised learning, specifically the Random Forest classifier, for land use and land cover (LULC) classification. It mentions the potential use of deep learning methods for analyzing aerial images of Kruger National Park in the future, but it does not provide details about the frameworks that would be used.

Deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch provide tools and libraries for developing and training large-scale neural networks. These frameworks have been widely used in various applications, including image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous systems. However, the context does not provide information on whether these or other deep learning frameworks were used in the study.
