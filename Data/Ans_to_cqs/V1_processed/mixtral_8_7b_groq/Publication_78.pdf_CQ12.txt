The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the description of the custom D-CNN model named CoralNet, which is used for the extraction of spatial features. CoralNet has thirteen layers, including three convolutional layers (Conv2D), two max-pooling layers, two dense layers, one flatten layer, and three activation layers. The input layer size is kept at 227 × 227 × 3, and the feature vector is extracted at the last layer. The training options used for training CoralNet include the Adam optimizer, 10 epochs, a batch size of 64, and Cross Entropy as the loss function. Additionally, the pipeline involves using AlexNet, another type of CNN, which shows the highest accuracy in classifying features as either bleached coral or healthy coral.
