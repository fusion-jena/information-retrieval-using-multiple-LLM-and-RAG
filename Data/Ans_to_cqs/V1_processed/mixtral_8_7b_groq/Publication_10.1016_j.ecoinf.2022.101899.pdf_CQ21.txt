Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. However, we can infer some postprocessing activities based on the information given.

After training the models, the text mentions that "burn-in steps, thinning steps and 4 chains were extracted" and "MCMC diagnostics are very similar to the informative model and show no issues with representativeness and accuracy." This suggests that Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) diagnostics were performed as a postprocessing step to ensure the models were well-mixed, representative, and accurate.

Furthermore, a Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) approach was implemented to consider model uncertainty. The resulting posterior model probabilities and Bayes factors were used to identify the most impactful model for predicting wildfire occurrence probabilities. This indicates that model selection and comparison were part of the postprocessing analysis.

Lastly, the context states that "the exponential of each βj parameter, exp(βj), represents the increase in the odds of having a wildfire for each unit increase in the predictor Xj." This implies that odds ratios or some form of model interpretability analysis were carried out to understand the impact of individual predictors on the wildfire occurrence.

In summary, the postprocessing steps involved after model training include MCMC diagnostics, model selection and comparison using BMA, and model interpretability analysis to determine the impact of individual predictors on the wildfire occurrence. However, there is no explicit mention of saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix in the provided context.
