Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The text does not mention any specific data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF in relation to the LaDeco platform. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query. However, it is worth noting that the LaDeco platform uses the ADE20K dataset, which was developed by the MIT Torralba team, for landscape applications. This dataset focuses on the recognition of 150 indoor and outdoor objects. It is possible that the data repository for this dataset could be one of the repositories mentioned, but without further information, this is only a speculation.
