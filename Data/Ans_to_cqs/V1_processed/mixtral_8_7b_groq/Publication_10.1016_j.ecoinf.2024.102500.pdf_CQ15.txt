The provided context does not explicitly mention any optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. However, it does discuss the use of hyperparameter tuning in machine learning models, which is a related concept.

Hyperparameter tuning involves selecting the optimal values for various parameters within a machine learning algorithm to improve its performance. The provided context mentions the use of grid search with fivefold cross-validation for this purpose. Specifically, it lists several hyperparameters for nine grid search ML models, including n\_estimators, learning\_rate, max\_depth, min\_samples\_split, min\_samples\_leaf, max\_features, min\_impurity\_decrease, min\_weight\_fraction\_leaf, loss, bootstrap, bootstrap\_features, max\_samples, max\_leaf\_nodes, l2\_regularization, max\_bins, min\_child\_samples, reg\_lambda, and reg\_alpha.

While this process of hyperparameter tuning is an essential step in optimizing machine learning models, it is distinct from the optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines. In deep learning, optimization techniques are used to update the weights and biases of the model during training. Common optimization techniques include SGD, Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot determine whether any optimization techniques are used in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can conclude that hyperparameter tuning is employed to optimize the performance of machine learning models.
