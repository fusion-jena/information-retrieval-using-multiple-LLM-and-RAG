The provided context does not give specific details about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it does mention that the images are tested one by one, and the neural networks with less than 100 layers are trained for 60 epochs, while those with more layers are trained for 80 epochs. This suggests that some form of data splitting or cross-validation may be used, but the exact method is not specified.

In general, data splitting is an essential step in deep learning model training to ensure that the model can generalize well to unseen data. The most common approach is to split the dataset into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final model performance.

There are different strategies for splitting the data, such as random sampling, stratified sampling, or time-series splitting. Random sampling involves randomly selecting a portion of the data for each subset, while stratified sampling ensures that each subset has a similar distribution of classes. Time-series splitting is used for sequential data, where the data is split based on time order.

The choice of data splitting strategy depends on the specific problem and dataset. For instance, in the context of plant image classification, it may be important to ensure that the training, validation, and testing sets have a similar distribution of plant species and growth stages.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific details about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it is an essential step in the model training process. The choice of data splitting strategy depends on the specific problem and dataset.
