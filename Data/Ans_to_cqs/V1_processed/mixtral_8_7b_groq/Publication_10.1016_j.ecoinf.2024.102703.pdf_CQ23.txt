Based on the provided context, it does not appear that a deep learning model was used in this study. Instead, a three-layer back propagation (BP) artificial neural network was built using MATLAB R2014b. Therefore, I cannot provide information on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model.

However, I can provide some information on the steps taken to ensure the validity and applicability of the artificial neural network model developed in this study.

Firstly, the authors used a diverse dataset of water samples from the Erhai watershed, which was categorized into four groups based on distinct geographical characteristics using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This allowed the model to encompass lakes and rivers with diverse trophic states, providing a valuable opportunity to investigate general trends in nutrient gradients associated with CDOM absorption variability with broader applicability to other plateau lakes.

Secondly, the authors used a three-layer back propagation (BP) artificial neural network, which is a type of shallow learning model. While deep learning models have gained popularity in recent years, shallow learning models like artificial neural networks can still be effective for certain tasks, especially when the dataset is not very large.

Thirdly, the authors used a single hidden layer in their artificial neural network model, which is a common practice in many applications. This can help to prevent overfitting, which is a common problem in deep learning models.

Finally, the authors used a training error of 0.001 and set the maximum training times to 10,000. They also used 64 water samples for model calibration and the remaining samples for validation. The validation accuracy was assessed by calculating the coefficient of determination (R2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) between the measured and predicted TSI.

Overall, while the study did not use a deep learning model, the authors took several steps to ensure the validity and applicability of their artificial neural network model. These steps included using a diverse dataset, a shallow learning model, a single hidden layer, and appropriate training parameters. However, the authors note that applying the models to oligotrophic and hypereutrophic samples may introduce uncertainty.
