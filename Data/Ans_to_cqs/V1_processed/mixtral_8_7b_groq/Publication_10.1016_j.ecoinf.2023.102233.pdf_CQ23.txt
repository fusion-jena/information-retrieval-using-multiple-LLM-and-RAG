The text provided does not give a detailed description of the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention some techniques that could contribute to the model's generalizability.

Firstly, the model's hyperparameters were tuned using a grid search technique (Mohri et al., 2018). This method involves systematically trying different combinations of hyperparameters to find the set that gives the best performance. This could potentially improve the model's performance on unseen data.

Secondly, the active learning approach was used to iteratively train and improve the CNN model (Sankupellay and Konovalov, 2018). Active learning involves selecting the most informative samples for labeling and training the model, which can lead to better performance with less labeled data. This could potentially make the model more robust and generalizable, as it is trained on a more diverse set of samples.

Thirdly, a random selection approach was used to select target calls, which was stratified across the model's predictions (logits) (Thakur et al., 2019). This method helps to reduce class imbalance within the evaluation data, which could potentially improve the model's performance on classes that were previously underrepresented.

Lastly, the model was trained using a batch size of 64, ten epochs, and a learning rate of 0.001 (Sankupellay and Konovalov, 2018). While the text does not explicitly mention cross-validation or stratified splitting, these techniques are commonly used in deep learning to ensure the generalizability of the model. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into multiple folds, training the model on one fold, and testing it on another. This process is repeated for all folds, and the final performance is averaged across all runs. Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset in such a way that the distribution of classes is preserved in each fold. This can help to ensure that the model is trained and tested on a diverse set of samples.

Therefore, while the text does not provide a detailed description of the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, it does mention some techniques that could contribute to this goal. These include hyperparameter tuning, active learning, class imbalance reduction, and standard deep learning techniques such as cross-validation and stratified splitting. However, further information would be needed to provide a more definitive answer.
