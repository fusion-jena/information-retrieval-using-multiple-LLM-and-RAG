In the deep learning pipeline, data annotation techniques are crucial for training models to understand and interpret visual data. These techniques include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation (Minaee et al., 2022).

Bounding box annotation is a technique where rectangular boxes are drawn around objects of interest in an image, enabling the model to learn the spatial location and size of the objects (Iglovikov & Shvets, 2018). This method is commonly used for object detection tasks, where the goal is to identify and locate objects within an image.

Semantic segmentation, on the other hand, involves labeling each pixel in an image with a class, enabling the model to understand the categories and spatial distribution of objects within the image (Minaee et al., 2022). This technique is used for pixel-wise classification, where the aim is to classify every pixel in an image into a predefined set of classes.

Instance segmentation is an advanced data annotation technique that combines object detection and semantic segmentation. It not only classifies each pixel in an image but also distinguishes individual instances of objects within the same class (Minaee et al., 2022). This method is particularly useful for tasks that require counting and tracking individual objects, such as identifying and counting trees in a forest or cars in a parking lot.

In the context of geographical and ecological applications, deep learning models such as Unet, Pspnet, and DeepLabV3+ have been used for image segmentation tasks (Çalıs¸kan, 2023a; Chen, 2023; Minaee et al., 2022). For instance, Unet has been used for floodplain forest ecosystem service value assessment in the lower reaches of the Tarim River in China (Land Degrad. Dev. 29, 47–57. https://doi.org/10.1002/ldr.2835). Additionally, DeepLabV3+ has been used for remote sensing recognition and classification of forest vegetation based on image feature depth learning (Jiang & Zheng, 2022).

In summary, data annotation techniques in the deep learning pipeline include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. These techniques are essential for training deep learning models to understand and interpret visual data, particularly in geographical and ecological applications.
