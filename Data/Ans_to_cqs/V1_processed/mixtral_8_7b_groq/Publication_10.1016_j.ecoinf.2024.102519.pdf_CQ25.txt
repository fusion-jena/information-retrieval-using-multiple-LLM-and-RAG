Based on the provided context, the specific deep learning model used or its purpose in the research is not explicitly mentioned. However, it is stated that various artificial intelligence techniques, including deep learning, have been successfully applied in different fields. Therefore, it can be inferred that deep learning was possibly used for one of its common purposes in ecological informatics, such as classification, segmentation, or detection.

For instance, deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used for image classification tasks in remote sensing and geospatial analysis (Wu et al., 2024). These models can handle large volumes of high-dimensional data and extract meaningful features from images, making them suitable for land use classification, object detection, or semantic segmentation in ecological studies.

Considering the data sources listed in Table 1, such as DEM, land use, NDVI, soil data, population, GDP, and meteorological data, deep learning models could be employed for various tasks. For example, CNNs can be used for land use classification based on DEM and other raster data. Alternatively, deep learning models can be used for segmentation tasks, like identifying specific land cover types or extracting built-up areas from DEM and land use data.

In summary, while the specific deep learning model's purpose is not explicitly provided in the context, based on the general usage of deep learning techniques in ecological informatics and the available data sources, it can be inferred that deep learning models were potentially used for classification, segmentation, or detection tasks.
