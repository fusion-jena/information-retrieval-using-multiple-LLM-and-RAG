The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that an 80-20% split for training and validation datasets, respectively, was used during the initial stages of model development when training a classification model on a random subsample of 400 images. This is because the text mentions that "We utilised transfer learning by initialising an ImageNet pre-trained ResNet34 model and applied an 80â€“20% split for training and validation datasets." However, it is not clear whether this data splitting approach was also applied when training the final deep learning CNN model on the full dataset of 7362 labelled images. Therefore, while there is some information about the data splitting process, the context does not provide a clear and complete answer to the query.
