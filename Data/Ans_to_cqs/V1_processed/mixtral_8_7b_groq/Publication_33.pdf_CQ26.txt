The provided context discusses the post-processing of a deep learning model to improve classification performance and the training process of the model, but it does not mention any techniques used for data bias reduction during the preprocessing phase. Therefore, based on the given information, I cannot specifically name any techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.

However, some common techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing include:

1. Stratified splitting: This method involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on specific criteria (e.g., class labels) and then ensuring that each subset is proportionally represented in both the training and testing sets. This helps maintain balance and avoid bias in the data distribution.

2. Oversampling: In cases where certain classes are underrepresented in the dataset, oversampling can be used to increase the number of instances from these classes. This can be done either by duplicating existing instances or by generating synthetic data using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).

3. Undersampling: When some classes have a significantly larger number of instances than others, undersampling can be used to reduce the number of instances from the majority classes. This helps balance the dataset and prevents the model from being biased towards the majority classes.

4. Diverse data collection: Collecting data from various sources, locations, and conditions can help ensure that the dataset is representative and less biased. This can include collecting data from different times of the day, weather conditions, or geographical regions.

As the provided context does not mention any of these techniques, it is unclear if they were used during the preprocessing phase of the deep learning pipeline.
