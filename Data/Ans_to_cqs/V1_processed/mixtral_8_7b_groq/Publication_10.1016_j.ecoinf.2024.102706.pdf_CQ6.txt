The provided context discusses the process of training machine learning models, including linear regression, elastic net, support vector machine, random forest, extreme gradient boosting, and light gradient boosting machine, to predict canopy cover from planet data. However, it does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps taken before training a deep learning model.

Generally, before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are involved, such as data cleaning, normalization, and scaling. Data cleaning involves handling missing or corrupted data, removing outliers, and dealing with inconsistencies in the data.

Data normalization and scaling are essential preprocessing steps for deep learning models, especially when dealing with numerical data. Normalization is the process of rescaling the data to a range of [0, 1] or [-1, 1], while scaling involves rescaling the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. These steps help to improve the model's performance, reduce training time, and prevent the vanishing or exploding gradient problem.

In the context of predicting canopy cover, the provided data may have undergone similar preprocessing steps. For instance, missing or corrupted data may have been handled, and the data may have been normalized or scaled before training the machine learning models. However, the specific preprocessing steps taken are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to the query regarding the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it is safe to assume that data cleaning, normalization, and scaling are essential preprocessing steps for deep learning models.
