Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline in this study uses image data. The main goal of the study is to estimate boreal forest ground cover vegetation composition from nadir photographs using deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN). The authors collected field measurements at three field sites and manually classified fuel types in the semantic segmentation training and testing process. They used a set of photos collected at a specific field site, Conklin (CK), solely for independent validation. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning pipeline in this study uses image data (nadir photographs) as the primary data format.
