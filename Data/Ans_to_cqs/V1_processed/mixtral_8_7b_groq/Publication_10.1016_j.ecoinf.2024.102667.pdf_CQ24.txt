The provided pieces of context do not contain information about deep learning pipeline strategies, including the use of random seed values. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer based on the given context.

However, I can provide some general information about handling randomness in deep learning pipelines.

In deep learning, randomness can be introduced in various stages, such as data shuffling, weight initialization, dropout, and batch sampling. Using a fixed random seed value ensures reproducibility by generating the same sequence of random numbers. This is crucial for comparing experiments, debugging, and reporting results.

Here are some strategies to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines:

1. **Fixed random seed value**: Set a fixed random seed value at the beginning of your code to ensure reproducibility. This applies to all libraries and functions that generate random numbers, such as NumPy, PyTorch, and TensorFlow.

2. **Stratified sampling**: When splitting data into training, validation, and testing sets, use stratified sampling to ensure each set has a similar distribution of classes or labels. This reduces the impact of randomness on the model's performance.

3. **Multiple runs**: Perform multiple runs with different random seed values to assess the robustness and generalizability of your model. This helps identify overfitting and provides a better understanding of the model's performance.

4. **Data augmentation**: Use data augmentation techniques, such as rotation, flipping, and scaling, to increase the size and diversity of your training dataset. This reduces overfitting and improves the model's ability to generalize.

5. **Early stopping**: Implement early stopping to prevent overfitting when monitoring validation loss. This stops training when the validation loss stops improving, even if the training loss continues to decrease.

6. **Regularization**: Use regularization techniques, such as L1, L2, and dropout, to reduce overfitting and improve generalization. These techniques add a penalty to the loss function or introduce randomness during training.

In summary, handling randomness in deep learning pipelines involves setting a fixed random seed value, using stratified sampling, performing multiple runs, applying data augmentation, implementing early stopping, and using regularization techniques.
