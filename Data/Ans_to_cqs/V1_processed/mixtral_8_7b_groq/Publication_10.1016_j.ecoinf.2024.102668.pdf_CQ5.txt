The provided context does not include information about the deep learning pipeline or any datasets used in it, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it focuses on the use of recording devices in ecological studies and the importance of reducing device bias for broader comparative analyses.

Two types of recording devices are mentioned: SongMeter and AudioMoth. For both devices, the sampling frequency (FS) and gain settings are provided. The SongMeter has a sampling frequency of 44.1 kHz or 48 kHz and a gain of 16 dB, while the AudioMoth has a sampling frequency of 48 kHz and a medium gain setting.

The context also discusses the application of a coherence measure to data from site S2, which reveals issues with the frequency responses of the SM4 recorder at certain frequency ranges. Specifically, the frequency responses at 7-8 kHz and above 12 kHz are not comparable due to the SM4 recorder's behavior change in the 7-8 kHz range.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
