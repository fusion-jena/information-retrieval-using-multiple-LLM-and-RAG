Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, I can provide some possible steps that might have been taken based on common practices in the field of machine learning and deep learning.



The process of deploying a trained deep learning model typically involves several steps, including model serialization, platform selection, and model integration.

First, the model is usually serialized, which involves saving the model architecture and learned parameters to a file. This allows the model to be easily loaded and used in other applications or environments. In this case, the model was optimized using the Adam solver with a learning rate of 0.001, and it had 10 neurons per hidden layer with a rectifier activation function.

Next, a platform for deploying the model is selected. This could be a local machine, a cloud-based platform, or a specialized hardware device such as a GPU or TPU. The choice of platform depends on various factors, such as the size and complexity of the model, the expected volume of requests, and the available resources.

Once the platform is selected, the model is integrated into the target application. This involves loading the serialized model and using it to make predictions on new data. The context suggests that the model was evaluated based on its performance scores, so it is likely that the model was tested and validated before being integrated into the final application.

It is also possible that additional steps were taken to optimize the model for deployment, such as compressing the model or optimizing it for a specific hardware platform. However, without more information, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit information about the process used to deploy the trained deep learning model, it is likely that the model was serialized, deployed to a suitable platform, and integrated into the target application. Additional steps may have been taken to optimize the model for deployment, but this cannot be confirmed without further information.
