The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the context where it mentions the use of a state-of-the-art CNN architecture called Inception-Resnet-v2, and also the employment of 'transfer learning' by using pre-trained layer weights from a classification task on a dataset from image-net.org for all CNN models used in the study. Furthermore, the CNN consists of parallel branches to incorporate different input data types, and a global average pooling layer followed by two dense layers in the regressor. Therefore, it can be concluded that a CNN model is used in this pipeline.
