The context provided discusses the use of a specific dataset in the context of deep learning for forest ecology, but it does not give detailed information about the data collection methods. However, it does mention the use of a ground-based profiling canopy LiDAR (PCL) multi-temporal dataset.

LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) is a remote sensing technology that uses laser light to measure distances to objects and the ground, creating highly detailed and accurate 3D representations of the landscape. Ground-based LiDAR systems are mounted on vehicles or tripods and are used to scan the ground and vegetation from close range. This technology is commonly used in forest ecology for measuring tree height, biomass, and other structural attributes.

In this study, the LiDAR data was collected at high, medium, and low points along a topographic gradient in a small yet representative region of the central Amazon. The dataset spans a three-month period across three environments, allowing for a more robust training and testing of deep learning models.

In summary, the specific method used for collecting raw data in this deep learning pipeline is ground-based profiling canopy LiDAR (PCL) surveys. This technology is commonly used in forest ecology for measuring detailed 3D representations of the landscape and structural attributes of vegetation.

It is worth noting that, although not specified in the context, other types of data collection methods such as public datasets, aerial surveys or satellite imagery could also be used in other deep learning pipelines depending on the specific application and data availability.
