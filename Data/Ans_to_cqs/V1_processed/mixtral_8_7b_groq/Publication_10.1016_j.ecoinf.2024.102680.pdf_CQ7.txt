The provided context discusses the modifications made to the YOLOv8 network for improving underwater object detection. However, it does not directly mention the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation).

In general, the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training can vary depending on the specific use case and the data available. Here are some common criteria used for splitting data:

1. Random sampling: This involves randomly selecting a portion of the data for each subset (train, test, validation). This method helps ensure that the subsets are representative of the overall dataset.
2. Time-based sampling: If the data is collected over time, it may be useful to split the data based on time. For example, the train set could consist of data collected up to a certain date, and the test set could consist of data collected after that date.
3. Event-based sampling: If the data is associated with specific events, it may be useful to split the data based on those events. For example, the train set could consist of data associated with one type of event, and the test set could consist of data associated with a different type of event.
4. Stratified sampling: This involves splitting the data based on specific characteristics or features. For example, if the data contains categorical variables, the subsets could be split such that each subset contains a similar distribution of those variables.

The specific criteria used to split the data for the modified YOLOv8 network mentioned in the context is not provided. However, it is mentioned that the batch size of all networks is set to 16 uniformly. This suggests that the data may have been split randomly or based on some other criteria that ensures a consistent batch size.
