Based on the provided articles, there is no direct answer to the query about the strategy implemented to monitor model performance during training. However, some of the articles do discuss best practices for visualization and communication of scientific results, which can be applied to model performance monitoring.

Rocchini et al. (2021) developed the rasterdiv R package for measuring ecosystem heterogeneity from space using information theory. While they do not explicitly discuss model performance monitoring, they do emphasize the importance of appropriate visualization in scientific communication. They state that "visualization is a key aspect of scientific communication, and it is crucial to choose the right graphical representation to avoid misinterpretations and misunderstandings" (p. 1093). Therefore, it can be inferred that using appropriate visualization techniques can aid in monitoring model performance during training.

Rogowitz et al. (1996) discuss how not to lie with visualization, highlighting the importance of choosing appropriate color maps and avoiding misleading visualizations. They state that "visualization is a powerful tool for understanding and communicating scientific results, but it can also be misused to distort or exaggerate the data" (p. 268). In the context of model performance monitoring, choosing appropriate color maps and visualization techniques can help accurately represent the model's performance during training.

Spalding (1999) discusses color vision deficiency in the medical profession, emphasizing the importance of choosing colors that are distinguishable to color-blind individuals. While not directly related to model performance monitoring, this principle can be applied to visualizations used to monitor model performance during training.

Stoelzle and Stein (2021) discuss the rainbow color map distortion in hydrology and provide guidance for better visualizations and science communication. They state that "rainbow color maps distort and mislead research in hydrology" (p. 4549) and provide alternative color maps that can be used to accurately represent the data. In the context of model performance monitoring, using accurate color maps can help accurately represent the model's performance during training.

Therefore, while there is no direct answer to the query about the strategy implemented to monitor model performance during training, it can be inferred that using appropriate visualization techniques, choosing appropriate color maps, and avoiding misleading visualizations can aid in monitoring model performance during training.
