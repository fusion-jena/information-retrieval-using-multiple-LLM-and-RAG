The context does not provide specific information on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, such as whether a grid search, random search, or some other method is used. However, it does provide some information on the general methods and studies used in the analysis.

The analysis involves the use of MaxEnt, a machine learning method for species distribution modeling (SDM). The training settings and hyperparameters used for each SDM are described in Table 3, but the specific details of this table are not provided in the context.

The study also uses a method called "curriculum labeling" which is a form of pseudo-labeling for semi-supervised learning, as described in the Cascante-Bonilla et al. (2021) study. This method involves using a small amount of labeled data and a larger amount of unlabeled data to train a model. The labeled data is used to guide the training process, and the unlabeled data is used to improve the model's performance.

Additionally, the study uses XGBoost, a scalable tree boosting system, as described in the Chen and Guestrin (2016) study. XGBoost is a popular machine learning algorithm that is known for its ability to handle large datasets and its flexibility in terms of hyperparameter tuning.

The context also mentions the use of BIOCLIM variables, which are a set of climate variables that are commonly used in species distribution modeling. These variables include mean temperature and precipitation variables, which are continuous variables.

In summary, while the context does not provide specific information on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, it does mention the use of MaxEnt, curriculum labeling, and XGBoost, which are all methods that allow for hyperparameter tuning. However, it is not possible to determine whether a grid search, random search, or some other method was used to optimize the hyperparameters based on the provided information.
