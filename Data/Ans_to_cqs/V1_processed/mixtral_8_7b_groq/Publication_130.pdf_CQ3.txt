The provided context discusses the use of deep learning in identifying and counting animal species, specifically birds, with a focus on automating data collection for training convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, it does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.

In general, data annotation techniques for deep learning models can include:

1. Image-level annotation: This is the simplest form of annotation, where an image is labeled with a single class or category. For instance, an image of a bird might be labeled as 'great tit'.

2. Bounding box annotation: Here, a bounding box is drawn around the object of interest (in this case, the bird) in an image. This helps the model to learn the spatial location and size of the object.

3. Instance segmentation: This is a more complex form of annotation, where each instance of an object is segmented from the background and other objects in the image. This provides the most detailed information about the object's location, size, and shape.

4. Pixel-level annotation: This is similar to instance segmentation, but instead of labeling individual instances, each pixel in the image is labeled with a class.

The context suggests that RFID technology is used to gather large amounts of automatically labeled data for training CNNs. However, it does not specify how these data are annotated. It is possible that the annotation is done manually, or through automated methods like bounding box or pixel-level annotation.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, common techniques can include image-level annotation, bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, and pixel-level annotation. The context suggests that RFID technology is used for data collection and labeling, but it does not provide details on the annotation process.
