Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. The study focuses on comparing the performance of a deep learning method (SAE) and a traditional machine learning method (SVM) for Landsat image classification and detecting invasive species. It describes the parameter setting method for SVM, but it does not mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional information.
