Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps taken after the model training. However, it does mention some details about the model architecture, training dataset, and evaluation metrics used in the study.

The model architecture consists of several layers, including convolution, max pool, batch norm, LRN, and inception modules, followed by average pooling, batch norm, linear, and softmax layers. The training dataset is referred to as D, and the study mentions the concept of Same-Specimen-Picture Bias (SSPB) in relation to the distribution of plant images for training and testing.

The evaluation metrics used in the study include Ops (operations) and a classification error rate of 34M. However, there is no information about the specific calculation of metrics, confusion matrix, or saliency maps in the given context.

In summary, while the context provides details about the model architecture, dataset, and evaluation metrics, it does not explicitly mention any postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.
