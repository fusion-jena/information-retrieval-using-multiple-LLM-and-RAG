Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text focuses on the methodology and results of the study, but it does not mention where the code for the pipeline can be found. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.

It is possible that the authors have made the code available in a repository, but they did not include a reference to it in the text. In this case, I would recommend contacting the authors directly to ask if they can provide access to the code.

Alternatively, the code may not be publicly available. In some cases, researchers may choose not to share their code, or they may have restrictions on sharing due to the policies of their institution or funding agency.

In general, it is good practice for researchers to make their code publicly available, as this can promote transparency and reproducibility in the scientific process. However, not all researchers follow this practice, and it can sometimes be difficult to locate the code for a particular study.
