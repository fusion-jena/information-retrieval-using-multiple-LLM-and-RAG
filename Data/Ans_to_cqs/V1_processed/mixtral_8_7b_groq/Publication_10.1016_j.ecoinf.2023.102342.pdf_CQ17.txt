The provided context does not contain information about regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context focuses on data mining, specifically the Apriori algorithm for identifying frequent itemsets, and the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process. While KDD involves data acquisition and processing, it does not mention the application of data mining techniques like deep learning or regularization methods to prevent overfitting. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer based on the given context.
