The data formats used in the deep learning pipeline described in the given context are images. Specifically, the authors use marine images from the Australian seas for training their deep learning model. These images are first processed using a pre-trained VGGnet, a type of deep convolutional neural network (CNN), and the activation vectors of the first fully connected layer are employed as feature representations. These feature representations are then fine-tuned using the Benthoz15 dataset, which consists of expert-annotated and geo-referenced marine images. Therefore, the data format used in this deep learning pipeline is image data.

The authors mention the use of large-scale hierarchical image databases such as ImageNet, but there is no explicit mention of other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV. However, it is important to note that the specific data formats used can vary depending on the particular deep learning application and the available data. For instance, in other applications, the authors might use audio data for speech recognition, video data for action recognition, or CSV files for tabular data analysis.

In summary, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline described in the given context is image data, specifically marine images. However, other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV can also be used in deep learning pipelines depending on the specific application and available data.
