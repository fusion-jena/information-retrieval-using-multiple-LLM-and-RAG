The provided context does not include information about the deep learning pipeline, regularization methods, dropout, or L2 regularization. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.

However, I can give some background information on the mentioned regularization techniques that are often used in deep learning to prevent overfitting:

1. L2 regularization: This method adds a penalty term to the loss function, which is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This encourages the model to have smaller weights, reducing the complexity of the model and helping to prevent overfitting.

2. Dropout: During training, dropout is a technique that randomly sets a fraction of the model's hidden units to zero. This prevents the co-adaptation of feature detectors, making the model more robust and less prone to overfitting.

These techniques are not specific to the context provided and are generally used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting.
