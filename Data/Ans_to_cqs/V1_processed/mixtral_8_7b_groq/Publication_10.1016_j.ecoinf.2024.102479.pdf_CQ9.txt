Based on the provided context, there is no clear information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The context includes several papers and resources related to soil data, forest biomass, and machine learning techniques, but it does not mention any specific data repository for a deep learning pipeline.

The papers and resources mentioned in the context include "SoilGrids250m: global gridded soil information based on machine learning" by Hengl et al. (2017), which presents a global soil dataset generated using machine learning techniques. However, the paper does not mention any data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study.

Another paper, "The role and need for space-based forest biomass-related measurements in environmental management and policy" by Herold et al. (2019), discusses the importance of space-based measurements for forest biomass estimation. However, it does not provide any information about a deep learning pipeline or its data repository.

The paper "Modelling aboveground biomass and productivity and the impact of climate change in Mediterranean forests of South Spain" by Herraiz et al. (2023) presents a model for aboveground biomass and productivity in Mediterranean forests. While the paper uses machine learning techniques, it does not mention any data repository for the deep learning pipeline.

The context also includes papers related to machine learning techniques, such as "Stochastic gradient boosting" by Friedman (2002) and "Package ‘neuralnet’" by Fritsch et al. (2019), but these papers do not provide any information about a deep learning pipeline or its data repository.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is not clear. It is possible that the data repository is not publicly available or was not mentioned in the papers and resources provided.
