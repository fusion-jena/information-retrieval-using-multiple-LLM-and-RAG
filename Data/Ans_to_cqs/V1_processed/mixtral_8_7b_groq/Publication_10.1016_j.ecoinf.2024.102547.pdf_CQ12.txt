Based on the provided context, there is no information to suggest that a deep learning model, such as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer, is used in the described pipeline. The study primarily focuses on the application of Fisheries acoustics techniques and spatial-functional data analysis to explore the spatial arrangement of marine organism aggregations using a multifrequency acoustics dataset. The analysis involves the use of Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) and Generalized Fractional Smooth Additive Models (FGSAMs) to examine the relationship between various attributes of marine organisms, such as thickness, relative density, and depth, and their surrounding environmental conditions. However, the context does not mention the use of any deep learning models.
