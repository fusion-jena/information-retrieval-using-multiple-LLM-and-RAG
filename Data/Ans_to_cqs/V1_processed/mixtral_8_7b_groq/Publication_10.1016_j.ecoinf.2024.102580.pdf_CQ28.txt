The provided context does not explicitly mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It only states that computing resources were used to train the deep learning models, but it does not specify if these resources were part of a specific cloud platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
