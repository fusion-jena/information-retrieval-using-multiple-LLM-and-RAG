The specific deep learning framework used to build the model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the study used the "multilayer perceptron (MLP)" for soil organic carbon stock (SOCS) modeling, which is a type of feedforward artificial neural network.

It is important to note that the MLP model can be implemented using various deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras. Since the context mentioned Keras in the references, it is possible that the study utilized Keras to build the MLP model. Nonetheless, without explicit information, it is not possible to definitively determine the specific deep learning framework used in this study.
