The provided context does not include specific information about how the raw data was collected for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The methods for collecting raw data are often not specified in research papers that focus on the analysis and comparison of different deep learning algorithms, as the authors assume that the data has already been collected and preprocessed before being fed into the models.

In this particular study, the raw data consists of high-resolution images of an urban area inside the Cerrado biome, with a Ground Sample Distance (GSD) of 10 cm. However, the context does not mention how these images were obtained, whether through satellite imagery, aerial photography, drones, or other means.

Therefore, it is not possible to answer this query without additional information.
