Based on the provided context, the text does not mention any measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The context focuses on machine learning models, specifically Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) and Gradient Boosting (GB) models, and their hyperparameter tuning.

However, it does discuss some techniques that can be applied to deep learning models to enhance their generalizability:

1. Cross-validation: The text states that model evaluation and hyperparameter selection were performed using fivefold cross-validation for four water quality parameters. This technique can be applied to deep learning models as well, as it helps to assess model performance and prevent overfitting by averaging the model performance over multiple iterations.

2. Hyperparameter tuning: The context discusses the importance of hyperparameter tuning for machine learning models, such as LGBM and GB models. Similarly, deep learning models also have hyperparameters that need to be tuned to optimize their performance and prevent overfitting.

3. Preventing overfitting: The text mentions that hyperparameters such as n_estimators, max_depth, and subsample were used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models. These hyperparameters can also be used in deep learning models to control the model's complexity and prevent overfitting.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not explicitly mention any measures taken to ensure the generalizability of deep learning models, it does discuss some techniques that can be applied to deep learning models, such as cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and preventing overfitting.
