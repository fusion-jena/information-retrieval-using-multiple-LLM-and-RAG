Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the use of a deep learning model in the described study. The methods section focuses on the use of standardization as a data preprocessing technique and the use of multiple linear regression (MLR) models for analysis. However, I can provide some general insights on how deep learning models can be made generalizable using the mentioned techniques.

To ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, researchers often employ various strategies such as using diverse datasets, cross-validation, and stratified splitting.

1. Diverse dataset: A diverse dataset is crucial for building a generalizable deep learning model. In the context of this study, both environmental data (population and geographic conditions) and air pollution data are of the Big Data type, with a volume in the order of terabytes. If a deep learning model were used in this study, a diverse and representative subset of this data would be used for training the model. This would help the model learn patterns from different subgroups and make accurate predictions for new, unseen data.

2. Cross-validation: Cross-validation is a technique used to assess the performance and generalizability of a deep learning model. In k-fold cross-validation, the dataset is divided into k subsets or folds. The model is then trained on k-1 folds and tested on the remaining fold. This process is repeated k times, with each fold serving as the test set once. The average performance across all k runs provides a more reliable estimate of the model's generalizability than a single train-test split.

3. Stratified splitting: Stratified splitting is a method used to ensure that the distribution of important variables is preserved in the training and test sets. In this study, if a deep learning model were used, stratified splitting could be applied to ensure that the distribution of air pollution levels or other critical factors is similar in both the training and test sets. This helps prevent the model from being overfitted to the training data or biased towards specific subgroups.

Since the provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model, it is unclear if these techniques were explicitly applied in this study. However, these methods are commonly used to improve the generalizability of deep learning models in other research.
