The purpose of the deep learning model, as discussed in the given context, is to estimate aquatic ecosystem health indices. This is achieved by using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model ensemble with an autoencoder. The model is used to estimate the Trophic Dependent Index (TDI), Biological Monitoring Working Party Index (BMI), and the Fish Assemblage Index (FAI) from ecological monitoring data. These indices are used to determine the status of the aquatic ecosystem.

The CNN model is a type of deep learning algorithm primarily used for image recognition and processing tasks. It is composed of multiple layers, including convolutional layers that apply kernels to extract features from input images, followed by pooling layers that reduce the spatial dimensions of the features. The model is designed to automatically learn hierarchical representations of data, making it effective for tasks like object detection, image classification, and even natural language processing.

The use of an autoencoder in the CNN model ensemble is to improve the extensibility of investigations on the health of aquatic ecosystems. An autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network used for learning efficient codings of input data. It is typically used for the purpose of dimensionality reduction or denoising.

In this study, the performance of the CNN model ensemble with an autoencoder is compared with the conventional model performances to determine the optimal data-driven model. The conventional models used for comparison include an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) regression model.

In summary, the purpose of the deep learning model in this study is to estimate aquatic ecosystem health indices using a CNN model ensemble with an autoencoder. The model is used to extract features from ecological monitoring data and estimate the TDI, BMI, and FAI indices. The use of an autoencoder in the model ensemble is to improve the extensibility of the investigations on the health of aquatic ecosystems.
