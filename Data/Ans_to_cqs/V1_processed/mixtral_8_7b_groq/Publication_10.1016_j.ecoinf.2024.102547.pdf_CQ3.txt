The provided context discusses the examination of spatial data characterized by functional attributes, specifically a multifrequency acoustics dataset from scientific echosounders in the West African water. The study focuses on analyzing the spatial arrangement of marine organism aggregations and their attributes, such as thickness, relative density, and depth, in relation to environmental conditions. The methods used include dimension reduction techniques and supervised and unsupervised methods that consider spatial dependencies within extensive datasets.

However, the context does not provide information on data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. These techniques are typically used for image and video data, where objects or instances of interest are annotated with bounding boxes or pixel-wise masks. In the provided context, the data is acoustics data, which is not directly related to image or video data.

Therefore, based on the given context, we cannot provide an answer to the query regarding data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
