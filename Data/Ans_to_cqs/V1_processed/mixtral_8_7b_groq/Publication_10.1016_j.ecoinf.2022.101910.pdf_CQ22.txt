The performance of the BirdNET deep learning model, a research project between The Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the Chemnitz University of Technology, is evaluated using the metrics of recall rate and the percentage of occurrences detected.

Recall rate, also known as sensitivity, is a common index used in bioacoustics technique to assess the performance of bird detection models. It measures the proportion of actual positives that were correctly identified by the model. In other words, recall rate indicates the percentage of bird occurrences that were correctly detected by the model out of all the actual bird occurrences in the validation dataset.

For instance, Cole et al. (2022) evaluated BirdNET for detecting 13 bird species in North America and reported a recall rate ranging from 9% to 68%. Similarly, Tolkova et al. (2021) obtained a recall rate ranging between 11% and 71% for three common bird species.

The percentage of occurrences detected is another metric used to evaluate the performance of BirdNET. It measures the proportion of bird occurrences that were detected by the model out of all the bird occurrences in the validation dataset. This metric provides an overall assessment of the model's ability to detect bird occurrences, regardless of whether they are correctly identified or not.

It is worth noting that the low confidence threshold employed in BirdNET may result in increased recall and false positive rates. The value of 0.4 used in the study is similar to the one used by Kahl et al. (2021) when evaluating BirdNET accuracy on 984 bird species. This threshold setting may affect the precision of the model, which is the proportion of true positives among all the positive predictions. However, the pieces of context provided do not include precision as a metric used to evaluate the performance of BirdNET.

In summary, the performance of the BirdNET deep learning model is evaluated using the recall rate and the percentage of occurrences detected. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to correctly identify and detect bird occurrences in sound recordings.
