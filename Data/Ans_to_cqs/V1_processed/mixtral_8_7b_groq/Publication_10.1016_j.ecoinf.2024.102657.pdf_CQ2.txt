The data formats used in the deep learning pipeline include .wav, spectrogram images, and .csv files. The initial raw data consists of .wav files, which are bird songs. These .wav files are then converted into spectrogram images using the Librosa python package. The spectrograms are 480 × 365 pixel images. For the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) portion of the program, these spectrogram images are resized to 224 × 224 pixels to match the input requirements of ResNet-18. The metadata information about the bird songs and their corresponding dialect types is stored in a .csv file. This metadata file contains necessary classification information for training the CNN and k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) models. The .csv file has five columns, one of which is 'dialect_folder', which lists the file path to the folder containing the bird song. Each folder is labeled with the dialect type and the year it was collected. The other columns in the .csv file contain additional metadata about the bird songs.
