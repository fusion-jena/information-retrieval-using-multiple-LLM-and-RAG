The provided context does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention that the batch size of all networks is set to 16 uniformly and that various object detection algorithms were trained under the MMDetection framework.

In general, training of machine learning models is often stopped when the performance on a validation set plateaus or starts to degrade, or when the model begins to overfit to the training data. This is typically determined by monitoring the loss or accuracy metrics on a validation set during training.

In the context of object detection, common evaluation metrics include Average Precision (AP) at different intersection over union (IoU) thresholds, such as AP50 (AP at IoU = 0.5), AP75 (AP at IoU = 0.75), and AP (AP averaged over multiple IoU thresholds). The context mentions that the CSMB and LKSP modules improved the AP50, AP75, and AP of the baseline network, but it does not specify the exact criteria used to determine when training was complete.

Therefore, while the context provides some insight into the training process and the evaluation metrics used, it does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete.
