Based on the provided context, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is audio. The research involves the classification of birdsong within natural soundscapes using deep neural network architectures. Specifically, three fundamental deep neural network architectures, namely DenseNet-161, ResNet-50, and vision transformers, are employed for this purpose. The study also incorporates various data augmentation techniques, which are predominantly applied to audio data. For instance, Gaussian noise, Pink noise, primary and secondary background noise soundscapes, mixed up random bird species, time mask, frequency mask, gain, loudness normalization, horizontal flip, vertical flip, time stretch, and tanh-based distortion are some of the augmentation techniques mentioned. However, the context does not mention the use of image, video, or CSV data formats in this research.

The data augmentation techniques are applied to enhance both the accuracy and generalizability of the models. The authors used a dataset of 397 different bird species and incorporated up to 19 data augmentation techniques. An iterative selection process was employed where only augmentations that enhanced classification performance were selected. The primary augmentation technique involved the integration of various noise samples and non-bird audio elements, which significantly improved the models' performance.

Furthermore, the context mentions the use of the librosa library, which is a Python library for audio and music analysis. Librosa provides various functionalities for loading, processing, and analyzing audio data, which further supports the idea that the data format used in this deep learning pipeline is audio.

In summary, based on the provided context, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is audio. The research involves the classification of birdsong within natural soundscapes using deep neural network architectures and various data augmentation techniques applied to audio data.
