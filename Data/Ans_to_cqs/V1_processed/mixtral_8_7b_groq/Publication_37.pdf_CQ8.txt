Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The pipeline was implemented in Python using Lasagne and Pescador, but the specific location of the code was not mentioned. It is possible that the authors have not made the code publicly available, or it may be hosted on a platform other than GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. If you are interested in accessing the code, I would recommend reaching out to the authors or checking their affiliated institutions' repositories.
