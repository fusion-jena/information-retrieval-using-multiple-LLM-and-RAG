I regret to inform you that there is no information provided in the context about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the use of Wikiloc as a data source for Call Analysis in Socio-Environmental Systems (CES) studies and the application of the Word2vec model for semantic analysis of textual data from Wikiloc. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information about the code repository location.
