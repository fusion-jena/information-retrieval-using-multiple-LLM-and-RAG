Based on the provided context, there is no information about the use of deep learning models or hardware resources such as GPUs or TPUs. The context focuses on a marine life monitoring program, including the use of an app to collect data on specific taxa. The app collects metadata on location, number of dives, and number of divers, which enables normalization based on "sampling effort." However, there is no mention of deep learning models or the hardware resources used to train them. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
