Based on the provided context, there is no information suggesting that a deep learning pipeline with standard datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet was used in the studies. Instead, the studies focus on wildlife conservation and habitat suitability analysis using specific datasets related to that field.

In the study by Soofi et al., 2022, the dataset likely includes poaching records and socio-ecological variables. These variables may include information about human settlements, roads, mines, mining roads, water resources, and connectivity areas (CAs). However, the study does not explicitly mention the use of a deep learning pipeline or any standard computer vision datasets.

The study by Su et al., 2015, focuses on the potential impacts of mining activities on the migration corridors of the Chiru (Pantholops hodgsonii) in the Altun National Nature Reserve, China. The dataset used in this study might consist of Chiru migration data, potential mining activity data, and spatial data related to the reserve. Again, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or standard computer vision datasets.

The study by Teitelbaum and Mueller, 2019, discusses the causes and consequences of nomadic animal movements. While this study provides valuable context for understanding animal movement, it does not involve a deep learning pipeline or standard computer vision datasets.

In the study by A. Mohammadi et al., the datasets used include Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), distance maps for mines, mining roads, settlements, and water resources, as well as information about connectivity areas (CAs). This study, too, does not mention the use of a deep learning pipeline or standard computer vision datasets.

In summary, the provided context does not contain information about the use of standard deep learning datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the studies focus on wildlife conservation and habitat suitability analysis using specific datasets related to that field.
