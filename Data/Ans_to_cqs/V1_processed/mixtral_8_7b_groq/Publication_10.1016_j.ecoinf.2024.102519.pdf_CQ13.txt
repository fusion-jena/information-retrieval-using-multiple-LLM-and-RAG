The provided context does not specify the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that genetic optimization algorithms were used to determine the algorithm parameters for landslide susceptibility prediction, and the optimization process was implemented by programming in Python. In the context of deep learning, hyperparameters are parameters whose values are set before the learning process begins. Common hyperparameters in deep learning models include learning rate, number of layers, number of units in each layer, type of optimizer, batch size, and activation function. The learning rate determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function. The optimizer is a method used to minimize the loss function. Examples of optimizers include stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop. The number of layers and units in each layer determine the complexity of the model. The batch size is the number of training examples used in one iteration. The activation function is a nonlinear function applied to the output of each layer, and it introduces nonlinearity into the model. Therefore, while the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are not specified, it can be inferred that they could include learning rate, optimizer, number of layers, number of units, batch size, and activation function.
