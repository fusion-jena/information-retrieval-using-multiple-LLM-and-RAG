Based on the provided context, there are no specific preprocessing steps mentioned for deep learning models. However, it is generally recommended to perform certain preprocessing steps before training deep learning models. These steps can include:

1. Normalization: This involves scaling the data to a smaller range, such as between 0 and 1, to improve the training process. This is because deep learning models are sensitive to the scale of the input features.

2. Scaling: Similar to normalization, scaling involves changing the range of the data, but it can also involve other transformations such as log transformation to handle skewed data.

3. Cleaning: This involves removing or correcting erroneous data points, such as missing values or outliers, to improve the quality of the data.

4. Feature engineering: This involves creating new features from the existing data, such as polynomial features or interaction features, to improve the performance of the model.

In the context of the initial coral cover data, the model was developed using a TVAE model from SDV, which is based on a Variational Autoencoder model. The model learns the spatially dependent distribution of cover for each of the six species of coral modelled in ADRIA. The radially sampled latitudes and longitudes from the synthetic site data set are then used to generate the synthetic data. However, the context does not provide information on the preprocessing steps taken before training the model.

In the context of connectivity data, the synthetic connectivity data was generated using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model. The GAN model features a generator component, which learns the latent features of the data to generate a data sample, and a discriminator, which is a classification model that learns to classify real and synthetic data. Backpropagation from the discriminator updates the model parameters in the generator with the magnitude of the update depending on the success of the discriminator in classifying the data. However, the context does not provide information on the preprocessing steps taken before training the GAN model.

Therefore, while the context does not provide specific preprocessing steps taken for the models used in the study, it is generally recommended to perform normalization, scaling, cleaning, and feature engineering before training deep learning models.
