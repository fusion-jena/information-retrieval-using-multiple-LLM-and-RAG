The context provided does not directly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss several image fusion techniques and their performance on different datasets. These techniques use various pre-existing datasets for training and testing, which implies that these datasets are sources of raw data.

The datasets mentioned include C-60, U45, and UCCS. The C-60 and U45 datasets are used for quantitative comparisons using UIQM, UCIQE, and NIQE metrics to evaluate the performance of different image fusion methods. The UCCS dataset is also used for a similar quantitative analysis.

The methods used to create these datasets are not specified in the context. However, based on the nature of the datasets, which seem to be collections of images, we can infer that the raw data was likely collected through methods such as digital image capture using cameras or other imaging devices. This could include various types of sensors or manual data collection methods like surveys, although the text does not explicitly confirm these.

In summary, while the context does not directly answer the query, it does imply that the raw data for these image fusion techniques is collected through digital image capture, potentially including methods like using sensors or other imaging devices. However, the specific methods used for collecting the raw data in these cases are not provided in the context.
