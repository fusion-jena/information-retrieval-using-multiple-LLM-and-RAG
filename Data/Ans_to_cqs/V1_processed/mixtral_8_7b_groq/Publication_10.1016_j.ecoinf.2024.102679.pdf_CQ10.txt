Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The articles discuss the use of deep learning and artificial intelligence for wildlife population estimation through aerial surveys but do not provide a specific link to the code repository. It is possible that the code is not publicly available or was not shared as part of the publication. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to the deep learning pipeline's code repository.
