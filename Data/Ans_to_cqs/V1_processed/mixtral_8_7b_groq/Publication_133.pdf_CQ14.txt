The provided context does not include specific information on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. Hyperparameter optimization is a crucial step in training machine learning models, which can be done using various methods such as grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, etc. However, the text focuses on the training process of the YOLOv5 model and the performance evaluation of a parasitoid identification model, without mentioning the hyperparameter optimization process. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer based on the given context.
