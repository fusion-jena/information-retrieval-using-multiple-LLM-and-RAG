Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The text describes the design of a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) for sound classification, the training and testing strategy, and the implementation of a cyber-physical system (CPS) for training and updating the CNN. However, it does not mention where the data used for training the CNN is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query. It would be necessary to have access to additional information to determine where the data repository is available.
