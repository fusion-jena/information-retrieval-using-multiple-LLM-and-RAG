Based on the provided context, the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly stated. However, we can infer that the data is in a format that can be used for regression analysis, since Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT) are used in the pipeline. GBRT is a machine learning technique used for regression problems, so the data is likely in a format that can be used for regression, such as a CSV file containing numerical data.

The context mentions that the data is used to analyze changes in growth across two herring populations, and that the data includes salinity and Reynolds Historical Reconstructed SST (sea surface temperature) at 5m depth. This information suggests that the data is likely in the form of time-series data, with measurements taken at regular intervals over a period of time. The data may be collected from sources such as the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the MET Office Hadley Centre EN4 quality controlled ocean data.

Additionally, the context states that the data is used in a flexible manner, with a learning algorithm used to find patterns in the data. This further suggests that the data is in a format that can be used for regression analysis, as GBRT is a powerful regression technique that can handle complex relationships between variables.

In summary, while the exact data format is not specified in the provided context, we can infer that the data is likely in a format that can be used for regression analysis, such as a CSV file containing time-series data on salinity and sea surface temperature.
