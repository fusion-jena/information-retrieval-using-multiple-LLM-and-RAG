The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is regression. The model is designed to predict different vegetation phenology characteristics, specifically the start of the season, the peak of the season, and the height of the peak season.

Deep learning models are a subset of machine learning models that are inspired by the structure and function of the brain, known as artificial neural networks (ANNs). These models consist of multiple layers of nodes (neurons), including an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. The input layer receives the data, the hidden layers extract features and patterns from the data, and the output layer provides the final prediction.

In this study, the deep learning model used is a type of ANN called a multilayer perceptron (MLP). MLPs are designed to mimic the way the human brain processes information and are particularly well-suited for regression tasks, where the goal is to predict a continuous output variable.

During training, the MLP adjusts the weights of the connections between the nodes to minimize the difference between its predictions and the actual outcomes. This is done using an algorithm called backpropagation, which allows the model to learn complex patterns in the data.

It is worth noting that deep learning models can be used for various tasks, including classification, segmentation, and detection. However, in this study, the deep learning model is specifically used for regression, with the goal of predicting vegetation phenology characteristics.
