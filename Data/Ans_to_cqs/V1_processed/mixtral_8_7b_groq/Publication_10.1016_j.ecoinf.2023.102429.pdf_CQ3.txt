Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, the context does contain information about various methods and techniques used in the field of ecological informatics, specifically in estimating soil properties and plant nutrients using spectral data.

In the context, there are references to using Vis-NIR spectral data for estimating soil organic carbon (Bai et al., 2022) and various spectral reflectance-based indices for soil organic carbon quantification (Bartholomeus et al., 2008). These studies, however, do not mention any deep learning techniques or data annotation methods.

Additionally, there are several references to partial least-squares regression (PLSR) being used for estimating total nitrogen (TN) in soil (Hou et al., 2024; Attri et al., 2023). Table 3 from the context provides important bands (nm) for TN estimation by PLSR, but it does not mention any data annotation techniques.

In summary, the provided context does not contain specific information about data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. It mainly focuses on the application of spectral data and various statistical methods for estimating soil properties and plant nutrients.
