The provided context discusses the use of transformers in the classification of remote sensing imagery, but it does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general practices in deep learning, some common data augmentation techniques for image data include flipping, rotating, and scaling.

Flipping refers to creating new images by flipping the original image horizontally or vertically. This technique can help the model generalize better, as it can learn that the orientation of the object is not always the same.

Rotating involves creating new images by rotating the original image by a certain angle. This technique can help the model learn to recognize objects in different orientations.

Scaling involves creating new images by changing the size of the original image. This technique can help the model learn to recognize objects at different scales.

In the context of remote sensing imagery classification, the paper by Amani et al. (2018) mentions the use of synthetic data, but it does not provide details on how the synthetic data was generated. It is possible that data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling were used to generate the synthetic data.

In addition, the paper by Jamali et al. (2022) mentions the use of a generative adversarial network (GAN) in combination with the Swin Transformer, but it does not provide details on how the GAN was used. GANs can be used for data augmentation by generating new images that are similar to the original images.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it is likely that techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling were used based on general practices in deep learning.
