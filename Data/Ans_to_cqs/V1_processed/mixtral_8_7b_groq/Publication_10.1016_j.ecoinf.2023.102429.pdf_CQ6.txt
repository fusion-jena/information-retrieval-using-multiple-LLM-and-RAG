The provided context discusses the preprocessing methods used in spectroscopy and chemometrics, particularly for soil nutrient concentration analysis. However, it does not directly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. 

In general, preprocessing steps for deep learning models can include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. 

Normalization is a process that scales numeric data to a common range, often between 0 and 1. This can help deep learning models converge during training and can improve the model's ability to learn. 

Scaling is a similar process, but it resizes features to have equal variance. This can be useful when features have different units or scales.

Cleaning refers to the process of handling missing or invalid data. This can involve imputation (filling in missing values), outlier detection and removal, or other techniques.

However, it's important to note that the specific preprocessing steps can vary depending on the nature of the data and the specific deep learning model being used. Therefore, it's always a good practice to explore the data and understand its characteristics before deciding on the most appropriate preprocessing steps. 

In the context of the provided text, the preprocessing steps mentioned are related to spectral analysis and include operations like smoothing, baseline correction, multiplicative scatter correction (MSC), and standard normal variate (SNV) transformation. These steps are performed in software like ViewSpecPro and The Unscrambler, and are aimed at enhancing the quality of the spectral data for further analysis. 

So, while the text does not directly answer the query, the general preprocessing steps for deep learning models include normalization, scaling, and cleaning.
