Based on the information provided, the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that the MLPnn-MC model used in the study involves the use of land use/land cover (LULC) data. This is because the model is used for LULC classification and accuracy assessment.

The results presented in Table 7 suggest that the input data used in the model includes information about the number of input layer neurons, hidden layer nodes, and output layer neurons. Additionally, the model requested a specific number of samples per class, which may indicate that the input data includes labeled examples of different land cover classes.

Furthermore, the accuracy assessment was conducted using a reference dataset, which suggests that the output of the model is compared against a set of ground truth labels. The accuracy metrics calculated include producer's accuracy, user's accuracy, overall accuracy, and overall kappa statistics, which are commonly used in land cover classification tasks.

Therefore, while the specific data formats are not mentioned, it can be inferred that the deep learning pipeline in this study involves the use of land cover data in the form of labeled examples or images, with corresponding accuracy assessment using a reference dataset.
