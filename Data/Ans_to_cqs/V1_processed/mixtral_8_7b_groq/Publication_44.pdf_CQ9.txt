I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The text describes the use of Herbarium sheet images for semantic segmentation, employing DeepLabv3+ with ResNet-101 as the feature extractor, and details the training process. However, it does not mention where the data repository is located or which platform was used for data sharing (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF). I hope this information can be provided in the future to ensure the reproducibility and transparency of the research.
