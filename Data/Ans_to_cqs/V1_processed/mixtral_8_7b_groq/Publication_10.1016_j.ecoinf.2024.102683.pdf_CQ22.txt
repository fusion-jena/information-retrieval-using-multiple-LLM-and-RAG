The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1-score. These metrics are calculated based on true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN) values.

Accuracy is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of input samples. It is calculated as the sum of TP and TN divided by the sum of TP, TN, FP, and FN.

Precision is the ratio of the number of correct positive predictions to the total number of positive predictions. It is calculated as TP divided by the sum of TP and FP.

Recall is the ratio of the number of correct positive predictions to the total number of actual positive samples. It is calculated as TP divided by the sum of TP and FN.

Specificity is the ratio of the number of correct negative predictions to the total number of negative samples. It is calculated as TN divided by the sum of TN and FP.

F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, which gives equal weight to both measures. It is calculated as 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall).

These metrics are widely used in the evaluation of deep learning models for image classification tasks. In the provided context, the proposed deep learning model based on attention mechanisms was evaluated using these metrics, and it achieved high values for all of them, indicating its good performance in identifying medicinal plants from similar poisonous plants.
