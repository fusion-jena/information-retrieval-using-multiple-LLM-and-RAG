The provided context discusses the use of an ensemble modeling approach in the study of species distribution, but it does not directly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss some techniques used in the context of species distribution modeling that can be relevant to data bias in other contexts.

In the study, the authors used a combination of regression-based and machine-learning models to predict the distribution of species. To test the performance of these models, they employed cross-validation by using 70% of the dataset as training data and the other 30% as testing data. This approach can help reduce data bias by ensuring that the models are tested on a representative sample of the data.

The authors also used the Area Under the Receiving Operator Characteristics Curve (AUC) as an index to specify the accuracy of the models. AUC is a scale that ranges from 0.5 to 1.0, with a higher AUC value indicating a more accurate model. This metric can help identify if the models are biased towards certain classes or features in the data.

In the context of deep learning, data bias can be addressed during preprocessing using techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the data into subgroups based on certain characteristics, such as class labels, and then randomly sampling from each subgroup to create the training and testing sets. This approach can help ensure that the training and testing sets are representative of the overall data and reduce bias.

Oversampling involves increasing the number of instances of the minority class in the data to balance it with the majority class. Undersampling involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class to balance it with the minority class. Both techniques can help reduce bias towards the majority class.

Diverse data collection involves collecting data from a variety of sources and ensuring that it is representative of the population or problem being studied. This approach can help reduce bias by ensuring that the data is representative of the real-world scenario being modeled.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, it does discuss some techniques used in species distribution modeling that can be relevant to data bias in other contexts. Techniques such as cross-validation, AUC, stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection can help reduce data bias in deep learning pipelines.
