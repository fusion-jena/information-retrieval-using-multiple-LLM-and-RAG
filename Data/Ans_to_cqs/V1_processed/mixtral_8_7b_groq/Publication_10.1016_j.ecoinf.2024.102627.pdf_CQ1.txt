The provided context does not give specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that a large environmental context around each observation is collected and provided to the model. This context includes 64 Ã— 64 2D tensors sampled at the kilometre-scale resolution, WorldClim2 bioclimatic variables, Soilgrids pedological variables, human footprint rasters, terrestrial ecoregions of the world, and the observation location (longitude and latitude).

It can be inferred from this information that the raw data is likely collected through a combination of remote sensing techniques (such as satellite imagery for the 2D tensors, WorldClim2 bioclimatic variables, Soilgrids pedological variables, and human footprint rasters) and direct observations (such as the observation location). Additionally, the use of terrestrial ecoregions of the world suggests that some pre-existing spatial datasets may also be used in the raw data collection.

However, it is important to note that this is an inferred answer based on the provided context, and the specific methods used for collecting raw data are not explicitly stated.
