Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training of DeepLabV3+. However, it is common practice in machine learning to calculate various metrics and generate visualizations to evaluate the performance of a trained model.

In the context of semantic segmentation, some of the postprocessing steps that could be involved are:

1. Metrics calculation: Common evaluation metrics for semantic segmentation include pixel accuracy, mean intersection over union (mIoU), and frequency weighted intersection over union (fwIoU). These metrics can be calculated by comparing the predicted segmentation masks with the ground truth labels.
2. Confusion matrix: A confusion matrix can be generated to provide a more detailed breakdown of the classification performance. It shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives for each class.
3. Saliency maps: Saliency maps can be used to visualize the regions of the input image that have the greatest influence on the model's output. This can help in understanding which features the model is focusing on for making its predictions.
4. Class activation maps (CAMs): CAMs are a type of visualization technique that highlights the discriminative regions used by the classifier to make a decision. They can provide insights into which parts of the image are most important for the classification of a particular class.
5. Error analysis: Error analysis involves identifying the common errors made by the model and analyzing the reasons behind them. This can help in improving the model's performance by identifying the areas that require further attention.

In the given context, it is mentioned that the model was trained on the Vasiliko site data, and the performance metrics were generated using the Kimisala-20 test image. However, the specific postprocessing steps involved are not mentioned.
