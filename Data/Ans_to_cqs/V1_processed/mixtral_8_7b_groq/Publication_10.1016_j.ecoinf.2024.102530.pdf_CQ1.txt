The study in question uses a variety of methods to collect raw data for their deep learning pipeline, including surveys, sensors, and public datasets.

Firstly, the study utilizes surveys to collect data on honey bee flight time and performance, which is linked to weather factors such as temperature, wind, precipitation, solar radiation, and their productivity in nectar and pollen. The study also conducted a survey with beekeepers in Quebec to obtain information on the area of agricultural land and its uses.

Secondly, the study uses sensors in the form of Lidar technology to collect data on the topography and land cover of the study area. Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) is a remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure distances to the earth. The study used a Lidar-derived Digital Elevation Model (DEM) with a spatial resolution of 1 meter to obtain accurate topographic data.

Thirdly, the study uses public datasets to collect data on land use and land cover (LULC), weather data, and the geobase of the Quebec hydrographic network (GRHQ). The LULC data was obtained from the Ministry of the Environment and Fight Against Climate Change of Quebec (MELCCFP) with a temporal resolution of annual and a spatial resolution of 10 meters. The weather data was obtained from a database with a temporal resolution of daily and a spatial resolution of 2.5 kilometers. The GRHQ dataset was obtained from the Ministry of Forests, Wildlife and Parks of Quebec with a vector format.

Additionally, the study used a database of agricultural parcels and declared agricultural production (BDPPAD) to obtain accurate data on the area of agricultural land and its uses. The BDPPAD is a database of agricultural parcels and production that have been linked to customer files from La Financière agricole du Québec (FADQ). It includes vector polygons that outline the agricultural parcels and covers most of Quebec’s agricultural land.

Overall, the study uses a combination of surveys, sensors, and public datasets to collect raw data for their deep learning pipeline. This approach allows for a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of the study area and the factors that influence honey bee flight time and performance.
