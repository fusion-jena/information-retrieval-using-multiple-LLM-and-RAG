The provided context does not contain specific information about the deep learning model, its architecture, or the hyperparameters used. Therefore, it is not possible to directly answer the query based on the given information.

However, I can provide some background on deep learning model hyperparameters that are typically used in similar studies, even if they are not explicitly mentioned in this case:

1. Learning rate: This is a key hyperparameter that controls how much the model's weights are updated during training. A learning rate that is too high may cause the model to converge too quickly to a suboptimal solution, while a learning rate that is too low may result in slow convergence.
2. Optimizer: This is the algorithm used to update the model's weights based on the gradient of the loss function. Common optimizers include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSprop, and Adam. The choice of optimizer can significantly impact the training process and the final model performance.
3. Batch size: This is the number of samples used in each update of the model's weights. A larger batch size typically results in more stable gradients and faster training, but it may also lead to overfitting if the batch size is too large relative to the size of the training dataset.
4. Number of epochs: This is the number of times the entire training dataset is passed through the model during training. A larger number of epochs may result in better model performance, but it can also lead to overfitting if the model is trained for too long.
5. Regularization techniques: These are methods used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. Common regularization techniques include L1 and L2 regularization, dropout, and early stopping.

Without specific information from the context, it is impossible to determine which of these hyperparameters (if any) were used in the deep learning model employed in the study.
