The text provided does not give specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the study involves remote sensing images and their semantic labels of land cover classes. These images are cut into regular image blocks for input during the DeepLabV3+ model training process.

Additionally, the performance of the MRS\_DeepLabV3+ model is evaluated using various datasets, including UAV\_2m and GF1\_2m. The model's performance is measured using the Overall Accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient. However, these datasets are not widely recognized like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query based on the given context.
