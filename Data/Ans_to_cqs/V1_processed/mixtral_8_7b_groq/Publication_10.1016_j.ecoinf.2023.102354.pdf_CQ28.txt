The provided context does not give information about which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. The focus of the text is on the use of deep learning and machine learning algorithms for enhancing groundwater-climate interactions understanding and investigating climatic hotspots implications within the sub-basins of the GAB region.

The authors used GLDAS-Noah data for soil moisture storage (SMS) and GRACE-derived terrestrial water storage (TWS) to quantify groundwater storage variations across the region. They also used climate modes/indices/teleconnections such as SPEI, ENSO, NAO, AMO, PDO, and IOD. However, there is no mention of the platform used for deploying the deep learning model.
