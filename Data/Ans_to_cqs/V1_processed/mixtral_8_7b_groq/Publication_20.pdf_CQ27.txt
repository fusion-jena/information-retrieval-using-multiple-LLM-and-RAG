The process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model involved several steps, including model serialization and platform selection. First, the model was trained using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture on a dataset of 20 fish species, with at least 2200 thumbnails per species class. The training lasted for 8 days on a computer with 64GB of RAM, an i7 3.50GHz CPU, and a Titan X GPU card. The model was trained and tested on a computer system with the Cafe platform, using the same CNN architecture for both procedures.

To prevent overfitting, the network training was stopped after 70 epochs, and a learning rate of 10 with an exponential learning decay and a Gamma of 0.95 was used. A dropout of 50% and an Adam Solver type were used as learning parameters, with a random Gaussian initialization for weight initialization. The raw outputs of the model were post-processed using two decision rules: (r1) keeping the most likely fish class if the "environment" was the most likely class, and (r2) considering "part of species X" equivalent to "species X".

To assess the influence of the dataset building on classification results, four different datasets were built using the raw training dataset of 20 fish species. The first training dataset, T1, contained raw fish thumbnails (T0) and their respective mirror images. Specifically, the number of thumbnails per fish individual was doubled by flipping each thumbnail with respect to the vertical axis, which homogenized the proportion of left-oriented and right-oriented individuals in the database. This procedure aimed to improve the average identification rate since fish individuals are seen in all positions.

The model was then serialized, which involved converting the trained model into a format that can be stored and loaded again for later use. The serialized model can be deployed on a platform of choice, depending on the specific requirements of the application. However, the context does not provide information on the specific platform selection process or how the serialized model was deployed.

Therefore, while the process of model training, dataset building, and model serialization is described in detail, the context does not provide information on the specific platform selection process or how the serialized model was deployed.
