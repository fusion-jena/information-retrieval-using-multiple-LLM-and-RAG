Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the input data for the deep learning model is a 40-dimensional feature set, which includes land use type, soil, topography, elevation, slope, aspect, distance to settlements, distance to roads, and distance to rivers. These features are derived from a grid with neighborhood features of six years and are used to model complex spatiotemporal dependencies in land use and cover change (LUCC).

The context also mentions the use of probability maps, which are used to determine water and settlements as constraint factors. These constraint factors are determined by manual interpretation and are not simulated. However, there is no information on how these constraint factors are annotated or incorporated into the deep learning model.

Therefore, while the context provides some information about the input data and output of the deep learning model, it does not explicitly mention any data annotation techniques used in the pipeline. It is possible that the authors used standard data preprocessing techniques such as normalization, scaling, and feature engineering, but there is no information on any instance segmentation, bounding box annotation, or other annotation techniques.
