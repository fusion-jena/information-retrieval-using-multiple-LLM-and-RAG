The provided context discusses the use of deep learning techniques for predicting landscape types, including the division of the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets. However, it does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. Therefore, based on the given information, it is not possible to determine if any bias mitigation techniques were applied during the data preprocessing stage.

Nonetheless, I can provide a general overview of common techniques used to address data bias in deep learning pipelines:

1. Stratified sampling: The context does mention that the dataset was divided in a stratified manner, which helps maintain class proportions across the different sets. This technique can help reduce bias in cases where certain classes are underrepresented.

2. Oversampling: In situations where some classes have significantly fewer instances than others, oversampling can be used to balance the class distribution. This involves creating more instances of the underrepresented classes, either by duplicating existing instances or generating synthetic data.

3. Undersampling: Alternatively, undersampling can be used to balance the class distribution by reducing the number of instances in overrepresented classes. However, this technique may result in the loss of valuable information.

4. Diverse data collection: Collecting data from various sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the target population can help minimize bias. This includes considering factors such as geographical location, demographics, and other relevant variables.

5. Data augmentation: Techniques such as rotation, flipping, and cropping can be used to artificially increase the size of the dataset and improve model generalization. This can also help reduce bias by creating new instances that better represent the target population.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, it does mention the use of stratified sampling. Additionally, common techniques for addressing data bias include oversampling, undersampling, diverse data collection, and data augmentation.
