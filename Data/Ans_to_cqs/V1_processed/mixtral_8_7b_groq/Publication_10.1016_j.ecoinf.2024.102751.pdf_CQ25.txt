Based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred that the deep learning model will be used for estimating soil moisture (Volumetric Water Content, VWC) on a reclaimed spoil heap. The model is expected to increase the accuracy of prediction by using advanced methods of data analysis.

In the study, a spatial modeling approach was developed for estimating VWC on a reclaimed spoil heap, which integrated remote sensing data (PlanetScope satellite imagery) and topographic indices. The study explored the development of this model, but it does not mention the use of a deep learning model.

However, in the conclusion, the study suggests testing more advanced methods of data analysis, such as machine learning or deep neural networks, to increase the accuracy of prediction. Therefore, it can be inferred that the purpose of the deep learning model will be to improve the accuracy of estimating VWC on a reclaimed spoil heap.

The deep learning model could be used for regression, which is a type of prediction task. Regression models predict a continuous output variable, such as VWC, based on one or more input variables. In this case, the input variables could be the remote sensing data and topographic indices.

Overall, while the specific purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context, it can be inferred that the model will be used for improving the accuracy of estimating VWC on a reclaimed spoil heap using regression.
