The provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does describe the architecture of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) used for a specific task. In general, data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to increase the diversity of the training data and improve the model's ability to generalize.

Flipping involves creating new training examples by horizontally or vertically flipping the original images. This technique helps the model to learn symmetrical features and improve its performance.

Rotating involves creating new training examples by rotating the original images by a certain angle. This technique helps the model to learn features that are invariant to rotation.

Scaling involves creating new training examples by resizing the original images. This technique helps the model to learn features that are invariant to scaling.

In the context of the CNN architecture described, it is possible that data augmentation techniques were applied during the training process. However, the specific techniques used are not mentioned. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this query based on the provided context.
