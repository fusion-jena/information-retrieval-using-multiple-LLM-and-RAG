The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the context is classification. 

These models are used to classify a given input into different categories based on the training they have received. In this specific context, the deep learning models are being used to classify the number of eggs in a given dataset. The models are trained with a subset of the training data and their performance is evaluated using a validation data set. The model with the highest performance is then selected for training on the full training data.

The different deep learning models used in this study include Deep Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (DeepConvLSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures. These models are commonly used for classification tasks in deep learning, particularly in the field of computer vision.

It is worth noting that the classification output of these deep learning models has yet to be improved, and the field of explainable artificial intelligence is working on understanding and explaining the outcomes of these models.

In summary, the purpose of the deep learning models in this context is to classify the number of eggs in a given dataset. The models used include DeepConvLSTM and CNN architectures, which are commonly used for classification tasks in deep learning.
