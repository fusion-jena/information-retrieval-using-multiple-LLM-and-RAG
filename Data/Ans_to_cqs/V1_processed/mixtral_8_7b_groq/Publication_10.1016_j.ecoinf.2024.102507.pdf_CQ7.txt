The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the data is split into different sets for training, testing, and validation purposes during the development of the deep learning model.

In the context, it is mentioned that the training data is prepared using different methods such as inputting the original data, data reduction, and data augmentation. The research team took these actions to address the issue of imbalance in the training data, which occurred due to the different areas of each forest type classification.

Additionally, the context mentions that the dataset is split into original, reduced, and augmented datasets, and the results of these datasets are compared. The comparison of these datasets suggests that they are used for training, testing, and validation of the deep learning model.

Furthermore, the context mentions that one of the optimal simulation results was achieved through the utilization of data augmentation and flattened convolution kernels. This result indicates that the data augmentation technique was used to increase the size of the training dataset, which helped improve the model's accuracy.

Therefore, while the specific criteria for splitting the data are not mentioned, it can be inferred that the data is split into different sets for training, testing, and validation purposes, and various techniques such as data reduction, data augmentation, and flattened convolution kernels are used to improve the model's accuracy.
