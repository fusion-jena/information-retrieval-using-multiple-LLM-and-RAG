The data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline, as discussed in the context, is pixel-based labeling or semantic segmentation. This technique involves labeling each pixel in the training data to differentiate between various classes in the image. The deep learning model, specifically a U-Net model, is then trained using this labeled data to classify pixels in new, unseen images.

In the context provided, the authors mention the use of a U-Net model implemented within the arcgis.learn module of the ArcGIS API for Python. This model uses a ResNet-50 backbone pretrained on ImageNet. The use of a pretrained network can reduce the amount of training data needed, making the deep learning pipeline more feasible for remote sensing applications where large, annotated datasets may not be available.

The context also highlights the importance of spatio-contextual information in remote sensing applications. While pixel-based labeling is sufficient for some applications, incorporating spatial context can improve model performance. Spatio-contextual information considers the relationships between pixels and their surrounding spatial context, providing additional information that can help the model make more accurate classifications.

It is important to note that the context does not explicitly mention other data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, pixel-based labeling is a common data annotation technique used in remote sensing and other domains where spatio-contextual information is important.

In summary, the data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline, as discussed in the context, is pixel-based labeling or semantic segmentation. This technique involves labeling each pixel in the training data to differentiate between various classes in the image. The use of a pretrained network can reduce the amount of training data needed, making the deep learning pipeline more feasible for remote sensing applications where large, annotated datasets may not be available. Incorporating spatio-contextual information can further improve model performance.
