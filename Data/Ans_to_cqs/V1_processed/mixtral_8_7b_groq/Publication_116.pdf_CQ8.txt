I am unable to locate the code repository for the deep learning pipeline in the provided context. The text focuses on the description and analysis of the deep learning pipeline used for plant species identification, but it does not mention or provide a link to the code repository. The context includes references to various papers and methodologies used in the study, but it does not include any information about where the code for the pipeline can be found. Therefore, I would suggest contacting the authors or researchers involved in the study for more information about the code repository.
