The deep learning models used in the pipeline are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This is evident from the context provided, which mentions the use of six open source CNNs: VGG16, ResNet50, ResNet101, Inception-v3, DenseNet201, and EfficientNetB0. These models are specifically chosen for their suitability for transfer learning and high performance on classification tasks. Furthermore, the context discusses the use of Faster R-CNN, which is a type of CNN used for object detection. Therefore, the deep learning models used in the pipeline are CNNs.
