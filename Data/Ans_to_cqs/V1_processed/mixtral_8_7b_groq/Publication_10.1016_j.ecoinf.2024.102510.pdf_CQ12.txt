The types of deep learning models used in the pipeline are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This is evident from the names of the models used in the study, which include MobileNetV2, EfficientNetB0, GoogleNet, DenseNet201, InceptionV3, ResNet18, InceptionResNetV2, and NASNetMobile. These models are all well-known CNN architectures that have been widely used for image recognition tasks. Furthermore, the study's focus on transfer learning, feature extractors, and fine-tuners also points towards the use of CNNs, as these concepts are commonly associated with CNNs. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning models used in this pipeline are CNNs.
