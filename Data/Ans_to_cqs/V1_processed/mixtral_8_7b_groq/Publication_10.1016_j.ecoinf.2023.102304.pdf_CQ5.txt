Based on the provided context, there is no information about the use of specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet in a deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the use of remote sensing data and various spectral bands for analyzing vegetation and wildfire recovery.

However, the context does mention the use of Google Earth Engine, a platform that allows for geospatial analysis at a planetary scale. This platform likely contains various datasets that could be used in a deep learning pipeline for remote sensing applications.

In addition, the context discusses the use of various vegetation indices (VI) such as NDVI, EVI, NBR, and others. These indices are derived from remote sensing data and could potentially be used as features in a deep learning pipeline for tasks such as land cover classification or vegetation health monitoring.

Here are some examples of how the mentioned concepts could be used in a deep learning pipeline for remote sensing applications:

* Land cover classification: A deep learning model could be trained on remote sensing data and corresponding land cover labels to classify different land cover types such as forest, grassland, urban, and agricultural fields. The model could use spectral bands as input features and vegetation indices as additional features to improve classification accuracy.
* Vegetation health monitoring: A deep learning model could be trained on remote sensing data and corresponding vegetation health labels to monitor the health of vegetation over time. The model could use spectral bands and vegetation indices as input features to predict vegetation health indicators such as photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic vegetation fractions.
* Wildfire recovery monitoring: A deep learning model could be trained on remote sensing data and corresponding wildfire recovery labels to monitor the recovery of vegetation after a wildfire. The model could use spectral bands and vegetation indices as input features to predict the stage of wildfire recovery.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention the use of specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, it does mention the use of remote sensing data and various spectral bands and vegetation indices that could be used in a deep learning pipeline for remote sensing applications.
