Unfortunately, there is no information provided in the given context about the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text focuses on the methodology and results of using a ResNet-50 deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for automated cataloging of oyster toadfish (Opsanus tau) boatwhistle calls in underwater soundscapes. However, it does not mention or provide a link to the code repository used in the study, which could have been hosted on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query as it falls outside the scope of the given context.
