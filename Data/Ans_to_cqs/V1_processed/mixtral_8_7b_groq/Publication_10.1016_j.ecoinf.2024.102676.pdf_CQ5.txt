The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for classifying three sympatric otter species. The study by Kistner et al. might have used a custom dataset of otter footprints, as there is no reference to standard datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.

The study by Gu et al. (2014) on sex determination of Amur tigers from footprints in snow could be a potential source for footprint images. However, it is not explicitly stated if this dataset was used in the study by Kistner et al.

Moreover, the North American Animal Tracks Database (<https://www.northamericananimaltracks.org/projects/north-american-animal-tracks-database/>) could be another potential source of footprint images for various species. Still, there is no direct reference in the context to this database being used in the study.

In summary, while there are potential sources for footprint datasets, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for classifying three sympatric otter species.
