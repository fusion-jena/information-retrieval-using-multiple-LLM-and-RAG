Unfortunately, there is no specific code repository link provided in the context regarding the deep learning pipeline. However, there are several links to different models, checkpoints, and pre-trained weights that are used in the deep learning pipeline. These include:

1. The GitHub link for pam\_annotation\_experiments by HKathman (<https://github.com/HKathman/pam_annotation_experiments>), which might contain the code for the deep learning pipeline.
2. The BirdNET-Analyzer repository on GitHub (<https://github.com/kahst/BirdNET-Analyzer/tree/main/checkpoints/V2.4>) containing checkpoints for BirdNET-1, which is used as an embedding model in the deep learning pipeline.
3. TensorFlow Hub links for VGGish (<https://tfhub.dev/google/vggish/1>) and Yamnet (<https://tfhub.dev/google/yamnet/1>) models, which might be part of the deep learning pipeline.
4. TensorFlow Keras applications for VGG16 (tensorflow.keras.applications.vgg16.VGG16(weights='imagenet')) and ResNet152V2 (tensorflow.keras.applications.resnet_v2.ResNet152V2(weights='imagenet')) that could be utilized in the deep learning pipeline.

It is recommended to check the pam\_annotation\_experiments repository (<https://github.com/HKathman/pam_annotation_experiments>) as a starting point to find the deep learning pipeline code.
