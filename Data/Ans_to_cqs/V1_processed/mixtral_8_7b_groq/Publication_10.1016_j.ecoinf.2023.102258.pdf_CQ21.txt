Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of post-processing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrix calculation after model training. However, there is information about some post-processing techniques used for event duration control in the context of sound event detection tasks.

One common post-processing step mentioned is the deletion or merging of very short events. This is done to control the duration of the detected events and improve the predictions. In some cases, the typical duration of events is estimated from the examples and used to postprocess the predictions.

Neural network architectures, such as Du_NERCSLIP(23) and Wolters et al. (2021), are specifically trained to infer and output region annotations, which can be considered as a form of post-processing within the neural network itself.

In the context of few-shot sound event detection, various methods are used for post-processing, such as peak picking, thresholding, and median filtering. For instance, the "CRNN event filter" and "Split-merge-filter; delete very long/short" are mentioned as post-processing techniques.

Another post-processing step mentioned is the use of a region proposal network for adaptive length sound event detection. This network generates region proposals, which are then classified as sound events or background.

However, the context does not provide information on other common post-processing steps like saliency map generation or confusion matrix calculation. Therefore, based on the given context, these specific post-processing steps are not involved after model training.
