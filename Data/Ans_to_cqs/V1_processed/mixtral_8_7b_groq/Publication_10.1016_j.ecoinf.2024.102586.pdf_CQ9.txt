Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The text describes the process of selecting and filtering data for further studies on invasive plant species, resulting in a herbarium dataset containing 240 specimen records. However, it does not mention where this dataset or the deep learning pipeline related to it are stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
