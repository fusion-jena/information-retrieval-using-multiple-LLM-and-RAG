The provided context discusses the use of deep learning for ecoacoustic assessment, specifically for understanding urban ecosystems through sound recordings. However, it does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I will provide a general explanation of some common annotation techniques used in deep learning, particularly for object detection in images.

In object detection tasks, data annotation involves labeling objects within an image by drawing bounding boxes around them and associating a class label with each box. This process helps the deep learning model learn to identify and locate objects within new, unseen images. Some common annotation techniques include:

1. Bounding Box Annotation: This is the most basic annotation technique, where a rectangular box is drawn around the object of interest. The box should be tight enough to enclose the object while still being large enough to provide context for the model.

2. Instance Segmentation: In this technique, each pixel within the image is assigned a class label, creating a precise mask for each object instance. Instance segmentation is more time-consuming than bounding box annotation but provides more detailed information, allowing the model to learn finer object boundaries and shapes.

3. Semantic Segmentation: Similar to instance segmentation, semantic segmentation assigns a class label to each pixel in the image. However, unlike instance segmentation, it does not differentiate between individual object instances. Instead, it groups all pixels belonging to the same class together.

4. Landmark Annotation: In some cases, it is necessary to identify specific points or landmarks within an object. For example, in facial recognition, landmarks might include the eyes, nose, and mouth. Landmark annotation involves placing points at these specific locations.

5. Polygon Annotation: Instead of using bounding boxes, polygon annotation involves drawing a shape with multiple vertices around the object. This technique is particularly useful for objects with irregular shapes or when a higher level of precision is required.

Based on the provided context, it is likely that the researchers used bounding box annotation for ecoacoustic data, labeling sound events within audio recordings with bounding boxes in time and associating a class label with each box. However, the text does not explicitly mention the annotation technique, so this is an educated guess based on the general practices in deep learning for object detection tasks.
