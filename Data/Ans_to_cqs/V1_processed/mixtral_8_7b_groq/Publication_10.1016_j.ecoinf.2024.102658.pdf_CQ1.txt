The provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the study uses two feature sets, 'random-CV' and 'spatial-CV', which were selected through different cross-validation (CV) processes in a previous study. These feature sets include data from various sources such as WorldClim and ETCCDI, and contain features like TN10P, TXX, BIO02, RX1DAY, and WSDI, among others.


While the text does not explicitly state the methods used for data collection, it can be inferred that the data was obtained from existing public datasets, such as WorldClim and ETCCDI. These organizations likely used a variety of methods, including surveys, sensors, and other data collection techniques, to gather the raw data that was processed and made available in these datasets. However, the specific methods used for data collection are not provided in the context.
