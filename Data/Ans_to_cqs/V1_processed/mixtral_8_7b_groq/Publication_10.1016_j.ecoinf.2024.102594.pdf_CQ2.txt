In the DeepLabV3+ model training process described, the data formats used are remote sensing images and semantic labels of land cover classes. These are cut into regular image blocks of 32 Ã— 32 pixels for input. The classification results predicted by the DeepLabV3+ algorithm are in TIF format, while the segmentation results obtained from MRS are in SHP format. The DeepLabV3+ algorithm itself is developed using the PyTorch (1.12.1) library in the Python (3.9) programming language. The loss function used is Cross-EntropyLoss, and the optimizer used in combination with ReduceLROnPlateau is Adam. The image data is in the form of satellite and UAV images with varying spatial resolutions. However, other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV are not mentioned in the provided context.
