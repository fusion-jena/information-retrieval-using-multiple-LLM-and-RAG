The provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of the CVIP100 dataset and the ImageNet dataset in the training and testing of deep learning models for plant leaf classification and pine tree classification.

The CVIP100 dataset is a publicly available dataset for plant leaf disease classification, which contains images of plant leaves with different diseases. The ImageNet dataset is a large-scale dataset of natural images, which is widely used for training and testing deep learning models for image classification tasks.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of sensors in the form of convolutional layers and filters in the deep learning models. These sensors can be thought of as virtual sensors that extract features from the input data.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline in the context provided include the use of publicly available datasets, such as the CVIP100 dataset and the ImageNet dataset, and virtual sensors, such as convolutional layers and filters.

It is also possible that other methods, such as surveys and other types of sensors, were used to collect raw data, but this information is not provided in the context.

In summary, the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline in the context provided include the use of publicly available datasets and virtual sensors. Other methods, such as surveys and other types of sensors, may have also been used, but this information is not provided in the context.
