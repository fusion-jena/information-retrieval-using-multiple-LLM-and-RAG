The context provided does not give specific details about how the raw data for the studies were collected. However, it does mention the use of two specific datasets, UrbanSound8k and Birdsdata, which were obtained from the data repository Kaggle. These datasets were used in a study to demonstrate the advantages of a specific deep learning model in terms of accuracy and inference time.

The UrbanSound8k dataset contains urban sound recordings, while the Birdsdata dataset contains bird vocalization recordings. These datasets were likely collected using audio recording devices, such as microphones or audio recorders. However, the specific methods used to collect the data are not mentioned in the context provided.

In addition to these two datasets, the study by Clark et al. (2023) mentions the use of a citizen science biodiversity monitoring project to collect bird vocalization data. This suggests that the data for this study may have been collected through a combination of professional recording methods and citizen science contributions.

Overall, while the context provided does not give explicit details about the methods used to collect raw data for deep learning pipelines, it does suggest that public datasets and citizen science projects can be valuable sources of data for such studies. Additionally, it is likely that audio recording devices were used to collect the specific datasets mentioned in the context.
