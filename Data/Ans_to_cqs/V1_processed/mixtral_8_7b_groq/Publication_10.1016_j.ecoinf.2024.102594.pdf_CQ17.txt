The provided context does not give specific information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some data augmentation techniques used during the training of the DeepLabV3+ model for semantic segmentation. These techniques include flipping the images and labels along the X or Y axis, exchanging between multiple image channels while keeping the labels unchanged, randomly rotating the images and labels by 90 degrees, and randomly adding noise to the images while maintaining the labels unchanged. These techniques can be considered as a form of data-based regularization, as they increase the diversity of the training data and reduce the model's reliance on specific patterns in the training set.

In addition, the use of a validation set and the ReduceLROnPlateau learning rate scheduler can also be seen as regularization techniques. The validation set is used to monitor the model's performance during training, and if the validation loss does not decrease after 5 consecutive epochs, the learning rate is halved. This can help to prevent overfitting by reducing the model's capacity when the validation loss stops decreasing.

It is important to note that, even though the context does not explicitly mention dropout or L2 regularization, these techniques are not mutually exclusive and can be used in conjunction with the methods mentioned above. Dropout randomly sets a fraction of the input units to zero during training, which helps to prevent overfitting by reducing the co-adaptation of feature detectors. L2 regularization, on the other hand, adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the model's weights, which helps to prevent overfitting by shrinking the weights towards zero.

In summary, the provided context mentions some data augmentation techniques, a validation set, and a learning rate scheduler as methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does not explicitly mention dropout or L2 regularization. These techniques can be used in addition to the methods mentioned in the context to further prevent overfitting.
