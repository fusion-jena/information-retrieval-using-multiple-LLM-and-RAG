The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model include overall accuracy (OA). The model's performance is assessed based on how accurately it segments the point cloud data. The segmentation results are compared with the ground truth to calculate the OA. However, the text does not explicitly mention other metrics such as precision, recall, or F1 score. It is possible that the authors used these metrics as well, but it is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
