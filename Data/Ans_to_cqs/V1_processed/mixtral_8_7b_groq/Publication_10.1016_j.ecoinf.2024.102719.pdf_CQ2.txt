Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of machine learning and deep learning models in the context of river health prediction, which implies the use of data formats suitable for representing environmental factors and river health metrics.

In the context of river health prediction, it is likely that the data formats used include numerical and categorical data, possibly in the form of CSV files. For instance, Zamri et al. (2023) used machine learning and deep learning models for river quality assessment, which would involve input data in the form of water quality parameters (numerical) and land use categories (categorical). Similarly, Adejo and Connolly (2018) used a multi-model heterogeneous ensemble approach for predicting student academic performance, which involved input data in the form of student demographic and academic performance attributes.

In the context of deep learning, the models mentioned in the text, such as XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), can handle various data formats, including numerical and categorical data. These models can be used with data preprocessed into a suitable format, such as numerical arrays or data frames.

While the context does not explicitly mention image, audio, or video data formats, it is possible that these formats could be used in other applications of deep learning. For instance, in computer vision, image data formats like JPEG or PNG would be used. In audio signal processing, audio data formats like WAV or MP3 would be used. In video processing, video data formats like MP4 or AVI would be used.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline for river health prediction, it is likely that numerical and categorical data formats, such as CSV, are used. Deep learning models can handle various data formats, including numerical and categorical data, and can be used with data preprocessed into a suitable format. Other applications of deep learning might use image, audio, or video data formats.
