The text provided discusses the use of dropout regularization as a strategy to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Dropout regularization involves randomly dropping out, or setting to zero, a certain percentage of the neurons in a layer during training. This helps to prevent overfitting by making the model more robust and less dependent on the training data. The specific dropout rate can be chosen as a hyperparameter during model training.

Additionally, the text mentions the use of a fixed random seed value in the context of comparing different training algorithms. Using a fixed seed value ensures that the same random sequence is generated each time the training algorithm is run, allowing for consistent and reproducible results.

It is also worth noting that the choice of optimization algorithm and its associated hyperparameters can introduce randomness into the training process. For example, the Adam optimizer, which is mentioned as being used in the study, uses a different learning rate for each parameter and updates them based on the past gradient history, which introduces a stochastic element to the training process.

In summary, dropout regularization, fixed random seed values, and the choice of optimization algorithm and its hyperparameters are strategies that can be employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
