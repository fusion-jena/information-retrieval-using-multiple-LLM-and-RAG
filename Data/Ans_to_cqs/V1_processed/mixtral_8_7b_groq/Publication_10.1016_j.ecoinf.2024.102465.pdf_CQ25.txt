The deep learning model in question is utilized for semantic segmentation, as described in the context. Semantic segmentation is a process where a model classifies each pixel in an image into specific categories, creating a pixel-level segmented output. This technique allows for a more detailed understanding of the image content.

The model used for this purpose is HRNet, which is known for its high accuracy and stability. HRNet performs semantic segmentation by simultaneously merging high-resolution and low-resolution convolution computations. This dual-resolution approach enables HRNet to maintain detailed spatial information while also capturing broader contextual features.

In the context provided, HRNet is employed to model social media image data in PyCharm software for semantic segmentation processing. The output of this process is then used to derive several quantitative indicators related to the urban built environment. These indicators include greenness, openness, enclosure, ground exposure, paving degree, aquatic rate, pedestrian proportion, and transportation proportion. Each of these indicators is calculated based on the segmented pixel data, such as the proportion of green pixels (greenness) or the proportion of sky pixels (openness).

In summary, the deep learning model HRNet is used for semantic segmentation of social media image data. This segmentation process provides the basis for calculating various quantitative indicators related to the urban built environment, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding and analysis of urban spaces.
