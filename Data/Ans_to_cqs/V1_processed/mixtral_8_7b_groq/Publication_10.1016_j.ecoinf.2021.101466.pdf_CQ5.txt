The provided context does not explicitly mention the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the EfficientNet model was trained and validated using prepared images in categories, with 80% of the 4000 images used for training and the remaining 20% for validation. The data augmentation method proposed in the study was applied to these images, but the specific datasets are not identified.

The context also mentions that evaluations were performed on a test video using IoU (Intersection over Union) as the threshold for positives or negatives based on the object confidence scores estimated by the object detector. However, the source of the test video and its relationship to the training and validation datasets are not provided.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
