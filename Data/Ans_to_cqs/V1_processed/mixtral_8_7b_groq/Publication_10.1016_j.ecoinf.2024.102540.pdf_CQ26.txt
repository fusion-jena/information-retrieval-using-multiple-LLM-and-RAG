The provided context discusses the use of deep learning techniques for image recognition tasks, specifically for detecting alates on sorghum leaves. However, it does not explicitly mention any data bias reduction techniques used during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Nevertheless, I can provide some common techniques used to address data bias in machine learning and deep learning.

Stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling are common techniques used to address data bias.

1. Stratified splitting: During the dataset splitting process, it is essential to ensure that the distribution of classes remains similar across the training, validation, and testing sets. Stratified splitting ensures that each subset has a similar percentage of samples from each class as the original dataset. This method helps maintain the balance of classes in each subset and prevents bias.

2. Oversampling: When a dataset has an imbalance between classes, oversampling can be used to increase the number of instances from the minority class. This can be done by replicating instances from the minority class or generating synthetic instances using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). Oversampling helps the model learn more about the minority class and reduces bias.

3. Undersampling: Alternatively, undersampling can be used to decrease the number of instances from the majority class. This can be done by randomly selecting a subset of instances from the majority class. However, this method may result in loss of information.

4. Diverse data collection: Collecting diverse data is crucial for reducing bias in the dataset. This involves gathering data from various sources, locations, and conditions to ensure that the dataset is representative of the real-world scenarios.

In the context of the given problem, the authors could have used stratified splitting during the imagery splitting ratio of 80:10:10 for training, validation, and testing sets. Additionally, if the dataset had an imbalance between alates and non-alates, oversampling or undersampling techniques could have been applied. Lastly, collecting diverse images of sorghum leaves with alates in different conditions and locations would help reduce data bias.
