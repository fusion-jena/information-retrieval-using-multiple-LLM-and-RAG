The provided context does not explicitly mention where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. There is no direct reference to data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. The text focuses on the technical aspects of the pipeline, including the use of TensorFlow, CUDA, cuDNN, and the Librosa library for data pre-processing. It also describes the hardware used for training and inferencing, such as the Nvidia 2070 super GPU and the Intel Xeon E5-1630v3 CPU. However, it does not provide information about the data repository. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query based on the given context.
