The training process of the models is stopped when the loss value of the model on the validation set no longer decreases. This criterion is used to determine when the training is complete. In other words, if the model's performance on the validation set does not improve, even if the training set's loss value decreases, the training process is halted to prevent overfitting. This approach ensures that the model's generalization ability is optimized and that it can perform well on unseen data.
