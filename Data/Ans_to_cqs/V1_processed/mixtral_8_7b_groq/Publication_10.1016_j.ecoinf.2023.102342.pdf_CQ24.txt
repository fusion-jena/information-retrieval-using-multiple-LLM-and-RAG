While the provided context does not contain direct information about handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, it does offer some insights into related concepts that can be applied by extension.

In the context of Gubner's Probability and Random Processes for Electrical and Computer Engineers, the book discusses probability theory and random processes, which are fundamental to understanding randomness in any computational model, including deep learning. By employing probability theory, one can model and analyze the behavior of random phenomena, which can then be used to inform the design of deep learning systems.

In the context of Guo and Xue's An Incorporative Statistic and Neural Approach for Crop Yield Modelling and Forecasting, the authors combine statistical methods with neural networks to improve crop yield forecasting. This approach can be seen as a way of incorporating known sources of randomness (e.g., weather patterns) into the deep learning pipeline. By combining different modeling techniques, the authors create a more robust and accurate model that can handle randomness in a more effective manner.

In the context of Guo and Xue's Crop yield forecasting using artificial neural networks: a comparison between spatial and temporal models, the authors compare the performance of spatial and temporal models for crop yield forecasting. This comparison can be seen as a way of understanding how different types of randomness (spatial vs. temporal) affect the performance of deep learning models. By comparing these models, the authors can identify which model is better suited to handle specific types of randomness.

In the context of Gupta et al.'s Role of existing and emerging, the authors discuss the role of data mining techniques in decision-making systems. Data mining techniques, such as Apriori (as shown in Fig. 2), can be used to identify patterns and relationships in large datasets, which can then be used to inform the design of deep learning systems. By using data mining techniques, one can identify and quantify sources of randomness in the data, which can then be incorporated into the deep learning pipeline.

In the context of Kouadio et al.'s Artificial intelligence approach for the prediction of Robusta coffee yield using soil fertility properties, the authors use artificial intelligence techniques to predict coffee yield based on soil fertility properties. This approach can be seen as a way of incorporating known sources of randomness (soil fertility) into the deep learning pipeline. By using artificial intelligence techniques, the authors can create a more accurate and robust model that can handle randomness in a more effective manner.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not contain direct information about handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, it does offer insights into related concepts that can be applied by extension. By using probability theory, combining modeling techniques, comparing models, using data mining techniques, and incorporating known sources of randomness, one can create deep learning systems that are better suited to handle randomness in a more effective manner.
