The provided context does not give specific information about the framework used to build the deep learning model for fire risk assessment in the MuÄŸla RDF study area. However, it is mentioned that various modeling techniques, including deep learning, were employed. Common frameworks for building deep learning models are TensorFlow and PyTorch. TensorFlow is a powerful open-source library for numerical computation, and it offers flexibility and ease when designing and training neural networks. PyTorch, developed by Facebook's AI Research lab, is another popular open-source machine learning library based on Torch, which is used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing. Both frameworks support GPU acceleration and have large communities contributing to their development and maintenance. Without specific information, it cannot be confirmed which of these two popular deep learning frameworks, TensorFlow or PyTorch, was used in the study.
