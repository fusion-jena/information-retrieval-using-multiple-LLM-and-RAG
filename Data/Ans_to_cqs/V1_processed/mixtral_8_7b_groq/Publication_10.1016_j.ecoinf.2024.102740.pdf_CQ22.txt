The provided context discusses the use of Random Forest (RF), a machine learning technique, and remote sensing for grassland evaluation, but it does not mention any deep learning models. However, I can provide information about the metrics used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models like RF.

For machine learning models, including RF, the following metrics are commonly used to evaluate performance:

1. Accuracy: This is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of input samples. It is a common and straightforward metric for evaluating the performance of a model.

2. Precision: Precision is the ratio of true positive predictions (relevant samples that are correctly identified) to the total predicted positives (the sum of true positives and false positives). High precision relates to a low false positive rate.

3. Recall (Sensitivity): Recall is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives (the sum of true positives and false negatives). High recall relates to a low false negative rate.

4. F1-score: The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall and provides a balance between the two metrics. It is a more comprehensive measure than accuracy, especially for imbalanced datasets.

5. Area Under the Curve (AUC-ROC): The AUC-ROC curve is a performance measurement for classification problems at various thresholds settings. ROC is a probability curve, and AUC represents the degree or measure of separability.

In the context of grassland evaluation using remote sensing and RF, the performance of the model can be evaluated using these metrics. For example, in the study by Raab et al. (2020), the authors used RF for estimating forage quantity and quality of semi-natural grasslands with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. Although they did not explicitly mention the evaluation metrics, they could have used accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score to assess the performance of their RF model.
