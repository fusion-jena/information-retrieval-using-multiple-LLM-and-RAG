While the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, we can infer that extensive datasets were employed for pre-training some of the models. These models include MobileNet, VGG-19, EfficientNet, ResNet-50, InceptionV3, and InceptionResNetV2.

ImageNet is a widely recognized large-scale dataset used for computer vision tasks, and it is likely to have been one of the datasets used for pre-training these models. ImageNet contains over 14 million images categorized into 21,841 classes, making it an ideal resource for training deep learning models to capture general features.

The CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets are also possible candidates for the pre-training process. Both CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 consist of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 and 100 classes, respectively. These datasets are commonly used for object recognition tasks and could have been employed for pre-training purposes.

The MNIST dataset, which consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), is less likely to have been used for pre-training the models mentioned in the context. This is because MNIST is relatively small compared to the other datasets and is primarily used for simple image classification tasks.

In summary, although the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly stated in the provided context, it is highly probable that large-scale datasets such as ImageNet, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 were used for pre-training the models, given their extensive use in the computer vision community.
