The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is specified in the code when the resnet18 architecture is called, as ResNet is a type of CNN that is widely used for image classification tasks. The ResNet architecture consists of a series of convolutional layers, followed by pooling layers and fully connected layers. The convolutional layers are responsible for extracting features from the input images, while the fully connected layers are used for making predictions based on those features. The use of a CNN is well-suited to this task, as they have been shown to be highly effective at image classification.
