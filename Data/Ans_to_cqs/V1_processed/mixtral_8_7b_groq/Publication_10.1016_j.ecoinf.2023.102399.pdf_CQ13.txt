The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model for fish biomass estimation. The focus of the text is on the performance metrics and the overall system, rather than the detailed configuration of the deep learning model.

The hyperparameters of a deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the choice of optimizer, can significantly impact the model's performance. Common optimizers include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adagrad, Adadelta, and Adam. The learning rate determines the size of the steps that the model takes during training, and it can be set to a fixed value or adjusted dynamically.

While the specific hyperparameters are not provided, the text does mention that the deep learning model is based on a neural network and is implemented for fish biomass estimation. This suggests that the model likely includes multiple layers, activation functions, and regularization techniques.

In summary, the provided context does not include information on the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model for fish biomass estimation. However, the text does provide details on the performance metrics and the overall system, which can still be valuable for understanding the effectiveness of the approach.
