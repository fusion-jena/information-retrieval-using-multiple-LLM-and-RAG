The text provides information that a P100 GPU with 16 GB of VRAM memory was used for training the deep learning model. In addition, the Colab notebook was set to a "high RAM session" to avoid memory limitations. This indicates that the GPU was the primary hardware resource used for training the model, and the high RAM session suggests that system memory was also utilized to support the GPU during training. The text does not mention the use of TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) or any other hardware resources for training the model. Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be concluded that a P100 GPU was the primary hardware resource used for training the deep learning model.
