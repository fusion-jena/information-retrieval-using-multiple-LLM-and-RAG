The provided context does not give specific information about the data sources or methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of a long short-term memory (LSTM) model, a type of deep learning model, for predicting land use demand.

In general, deep learning models like the LSTM model can use various types of data as inputs, such as time series data, image data, and text data. The data used for training these models can come from a variety of sources, including but not limited to surveys, sensors, and public datasets.

For example, in the context of land use demand prediction, data on land use patterns and trends over time could be collected from government agencies or other organizations that track and report this information. Additionally, remote sensing data from satellites or other sources could be used to gather information about land cover and land use changes. Surveys or other data collection methods could also be used to gather information about the factors that influence land use demand, such as population growth, economic development, and environmental conditions.

It's also worth noting that the context mentions the use of uncertainty analysis methods in conjunction with a multiobjective programming (MOP) model for optimizing land allocation. These methods may require additional data sources or information beyond the land use demand data used in the LSTM model.

Overall, while the provided context does not give specific details about the data sources or methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it is likely that a variety of data sources and methods could be used depending on the specific application and research question.
