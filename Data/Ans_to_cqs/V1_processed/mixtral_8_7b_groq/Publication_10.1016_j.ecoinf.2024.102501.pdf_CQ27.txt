Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. However, we can infer some parts of the process based on the information available.

In the study by Heddam et al. (2022b), they developed a long-short term memory (LSTM) deep learning model to predict dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in rivers. They used the data from the first eight days for training and the data from the last two days for validation. The four water quality parameters, Ec, Tem, Tur, and H, were used as inputs of the model. The test environment consisted of an Intel I5-5200U processor with a CPU clock speed of 2.2 GHz and memory of 8 GB, running on Windows 10 (64-bit), using Python 3.7 (64-bit) and Anaconda 3 for implementation.

However, the context does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed or integrated into a production environment. Model serialization is the process of saving the trained model into a file, which can be used for later deployment. Platform selection refers to choosing the appropriate hardware and software environment for deploying the model.

In other studies, such as Areerachakul et al. (2013), they integrated unsupervised and supervised neural networks to predict DO concentration in canals. They used MATLAB for implementation, but there is no information provided about model serialization or platform selection. Similarly, Arora and Keshari (2021) developed an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model for DO modeling of the Yamuna River, but there is no information provided about model deployment.

Therefore, while the context provides information about the development and training of deep learning models for predicting DO concentration, it does not provide explicit information about the process of deploying the trained models.
