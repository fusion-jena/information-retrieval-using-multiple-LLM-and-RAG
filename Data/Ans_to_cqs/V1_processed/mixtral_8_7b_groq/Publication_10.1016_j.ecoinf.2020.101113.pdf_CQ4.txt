The provided context discusses the importance of data augmentation in the bioacoustic recognition field, particularly for deep learning models. However, it does not specify the data augmentation techniques applied in the mentioned study. Therefore, I cannot provide specific techniques used in that research.

However, generally, in deep learning, common data augmentation techniques include:

1. Flipping: This technique involves horizontally flipping images, which can help the model generalize better, as it can learn features that are symmetrical.
2. Rotation: Rotating images can help the model learn features that should be invariant to orientation.
3. Scaling: Scaling or zooming images can help the model learn features at different scales and handle objects of different sizes.
4. Translation: Translating or shifting images can help the model learn features that should be invariant to location within the image.
5. Color jittering: Changing the brightness, contrast, saturation, or hue of images can help the model handle variations in lighting and color conditions.
6. Noise addition: Adding different types of noise (e.g., Gaussian noise, salt and pepper noise) can help the model learn to handle noisy data.

In the context of bioacoustic recognition, data augmentation techniques could include:

1. Adding background noise: Adding noise from various environments can help the model learn to handle real-world soundscape recordings.
2. Time-stretching or pitch-shifting: Changing the tempo or pitch of calls can help the model learn features that should be invariant to these transformations.
3. Adding or removing harmonics: Modifying the harmonic structure of calls can help the model learn features that are robust to variations in the harmonic content.

For future research, the context suggests investigating optimal data augmentation methods for bioacoustic recognition, which implies that researchers should explore and develop appropriate data augmentation techniques for this specific field.
