The provided context does not directly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss data preprocessing and mining techniques in a broader context.

In the KDD process, which includes data acquisition and processing, one of the steps is the pre-selection of useful data to achieve the objective. This step may involve addressing data bias, depending on the specific dataset and objective.

In the context of data mining, the Apriori algorithm is used to identify the most frequent itemsets in a given database. This algorithm consists of a sequence of steps that involve joining and pruning. Pruning is a data compression technique used to reduce the size of decision trees by removing non-critical and redundant sections. This technique can potentially help reduce bias by ensuring that all relevant data is considered and that no particular subset of the data is overrepresented.

Regarding the preprocessing techniques mentioned in the query, stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling are commonly used techniques to address data bias. Stratified splitting involves dividing the data into subsets that maintain the original dataset's distribution of classes. Oversampling and undersampling involve adjusting the class distribution by either adding or removing instances from the dataset.

Diverse data collection is another technique that can help reduce bias by ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population. This technique involves collecting data from various sources and ensuring that the dataset includes a diverse range of characteristics.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, it does discuss data preprocessing and mining techniques. Additionally, the query mentions several techniques commonly used to address data bias, including stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.
