The specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that it is a regression model designed for making day-ahead predictions of three pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, and NO2). The evaluation of this model is based on mean squared error/root mean squared error (MSE/RMSE) and mean absolute error, which are common metrics for regression problems. Figures and tables in the context show the model's performance and hardware specifications used for testing scalability, but the deep learning model's architecture (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer) remains undisclosed.
