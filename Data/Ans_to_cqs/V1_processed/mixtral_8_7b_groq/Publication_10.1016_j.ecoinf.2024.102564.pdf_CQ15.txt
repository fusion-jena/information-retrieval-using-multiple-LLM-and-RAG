The provided context discusses the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Random Forests (RFs) in a specific study, but it does not explicitly mention any optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam.

However, it does mention the use of two training algorithms for ANNs: Resilient Propagation (Rprop) and Scaled Conjugate Gradient (SCG). Rprop is a popular optimization algorithm for training neural networks, although it is not as commonly used in deep learning as SGD or its variants. SCG is a quasi-Newton optimization method that can be used for training neural networks, but it is not typically used in deep learning due to its higher computational cost.

In the context of deep learning, SGD and its variants, such as Adam, are more commonly used optimization techniques. SGD is an optimization algorithm that updates the model parameters by taking a step in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters. Adam is a popular variant of SGD that incorporates adaptive learning rates for each parameter.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is unclear which optimization techniques were used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that the ANNs were implemented using the MLP function of the “RSNNS” Package in R, which may use SGD or another optimization algorithm as the default. Further information would be needed to determine the specific optimization techniques used in this study.
