In the context provided, two regularization methods are mentioned to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline: maximum pooling and Local Response Normalization (LRN).

Maximum pooling is a type of pooling operator that is used to extract the main features of a certain area, reduce the number of parameters, and prevent the model from overfitting. In the given context, a 2 × 2 window with 2 strides is used in the maximum pooling layer. This means that the maximum value within a 2 × 2 window is taken, and the window is moved with a stride of 2. This results in a pooling output with a size of 56 × 56 × 64.

Local Response Normalization (LRN) is another regularization method mentioned in the context. LRN normalizes the local response by enhancing the larger response value and reducing the smaller response value. This helps to improve the generalization of the model. The output result of the LRN is the data with the size of 56 × 56 × 64.

However, other regularization methods such as dropout and L2 regularization are not mentioned in the provided context. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to prevent overfitting. L2 regularization, on the other hand, adds a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages large weights and helps to prevent overfitting.

Therefore, while the provided context mentions two regularization methods, it does not cover all the regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines.
