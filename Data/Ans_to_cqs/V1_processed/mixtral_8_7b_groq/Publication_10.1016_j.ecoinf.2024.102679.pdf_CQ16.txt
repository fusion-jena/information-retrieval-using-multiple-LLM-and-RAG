The context does not provide explicit information on the specific criterion used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention that during the training process, the model's performance was evaluated on the validation set at each epoch, and the model from the epoch with the best performance was selected. This suggests that one of the criteria used to determine training completion could be when the validation loss plateaus or starts to degrade, indicating that further training is unlikely to improve the model's performance. Additionally, the context mentions that the batch was equally balanced between positive and negative patches during training to avoid a severe imbalance, which could also be a factor in determining training completion.
