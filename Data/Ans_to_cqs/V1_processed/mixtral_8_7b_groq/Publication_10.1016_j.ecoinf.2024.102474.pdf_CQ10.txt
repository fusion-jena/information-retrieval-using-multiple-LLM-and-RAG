Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text mentions the use of the PyTorch Lightning framework for implementing the models and tuning hyperparameters using Optuna, but it does not give a link to the specific implementation or code repository used in the research. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
