Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context includes several papers and sources that discuss various topics in the field of computer vision, remote sensing, and laser scanning, but none of them mention or provide a code repository for a deep learning pipeline.

For instance, the paper "Generalized Focal Loss: Learning Qualified and Distributed Bounding Boxes for Dense Object Detection" by Li et al. (2020b) presents a new loss function for object detection, but it does not provide any code or implementation details. Similarly, the paper "A modified YOLOv8 detection network for UAV aerial image recognition" by Li et al. (2023) introduces a modified version of the YOLOv8 network for aerial image recognition, but it does not mention where the code is available.

Furthermore, the sources that discuss laser scanning and data collection, such as Liang et al. (2016), Wagner et al. (2024), and the RIEGL VZ-400i manual, do not provide any information about a deep learning pipeline or its code repository.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query as the necessary information is not present in the given context.
