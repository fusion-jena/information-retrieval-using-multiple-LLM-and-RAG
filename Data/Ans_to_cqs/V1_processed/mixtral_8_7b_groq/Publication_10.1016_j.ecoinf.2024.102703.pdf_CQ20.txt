The context provided does not give information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It only mentions that the model was built using MATLAB R2014b. The training of neural networks can be accelerated with the use of specialized hardware such as GPUs or TPUs, but the context does not specify if these were used. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional information.
