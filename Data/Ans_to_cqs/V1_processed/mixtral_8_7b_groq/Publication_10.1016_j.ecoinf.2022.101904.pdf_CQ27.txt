The text provided does not give specific details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that the authors proposed a new model called "3DUNetGSFormer" for large-scale wetland mapping using remote sensing data. The model is a combination of a 3D U-Net Generative Adversarial Network (3DUNetGAN) and a Swin Transformer.

The Swin Transformer is a state-of-the-art vision transformer that has shown better generalization capability compared to Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithms. It acquires global contextual knowledge through self-attention, which allows it to have a better understanding of the entire image, unlike CNNs that focus on local features.

The 3DUNetGAN is a generative model that can synthesize wetland training data, which is a critical step in ecosystem monitoring. The model is based on a 3D U-Net architecture, which is an extension of the 2D U-Net architecture to handle 3D data. The 3D U-Net is a convolutional neural network that is widely used in biomedical image segmentation. The GAN part of the model is used to generate new data that is similar to the existing data, which can help overcome the problem of limited ground-truth data.

The authors evaluated their proposed model using a dataset consisting of remote sensing images of wetlands. The dataset contained seven classes, including bog, fen, marsh, shallow water, urban, deep water, and upland. The authors compared their model with other state-of-the-art models, including Vision Transformer (ViT), Swin Transformer, CoAtNet, and CNN + ST (ours). The results showed that the proposed model outperformed the other models in terms of overall accuracy, kappa index, and average accuracy.

Therefore, while the text does not provide specific details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, it does give insights into the development of the proposed model and its evaluation using a remote sensing dataset. The proposed model is a combination of a 3D U-Net Generative Adversarial Network and a Swin Transformer, which allows it to synthesize wetland training data and acquire global contextual knowledge, resulting in better performance compared to other state-of-the-art models.
