The provided context does not give specific information about the learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the models were initialized with pre-trained weights from the 'imagenet' dataset and trained for 10 epochs with a batch size of 32. The class mode was set to 'categorical' for multi-class classification tasks. These details suggest that the models underwent standard training for a moderate number of epochs with a common batch size, and that one-hot encoding was used for labeling.

The context also mentions that GPU acceleration was used to expedite computations, which implies that the choice of optimizer may have taken into account the computational efficiency provided by GPUs. However, without explicit information, it is not possible to determine the specific hyperparameters used in the model.

In summary, while the context provides some information about the training procedure and data preprocessing, it does not give specific details about the learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model.
