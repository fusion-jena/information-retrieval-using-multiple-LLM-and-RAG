Based on the provided context, the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipelines are not explicitly mentioned. However, some of the sources do indicate the types of data used in their research.

Liu and Abd-Elrahman (2018) utilized unmanned aerial systems (UAS) imagery for wetlands classification. Marasigan et al. (2019) worked with airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data for mangrove crown diameter measurement. Martins et al. (2021) used high-resolution satellite images for tree canopies segmentation in urban areas. Jin et al. (2018) segmented terrestrial LiDAR data for individual maize plants. Kaartinen et al. (2012) compared individual tree detection and extraction using airborne laser scanning data from various countries. Kuenzer et al. (2011) reviewed remote sensing of mangrove ecosystems using various remote sensing data. Mohammadimanesh et al. (2019) used polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery for semantic segmentation. Peng et al. (2021) utilized Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-LiDAR data for tree height measurements in degraded tropical forests.

While these studies do not explicitly mention standard deep learning datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, they do show that deep learning techniques can be applied to various remote sensing and other domain-specific datasets for image analysis, object detection, and segmentation tasks.
