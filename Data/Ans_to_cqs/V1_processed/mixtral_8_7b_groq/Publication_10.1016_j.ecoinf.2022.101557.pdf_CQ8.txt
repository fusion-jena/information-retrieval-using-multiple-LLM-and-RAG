Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention or give information about the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. It is not specified whether the code is available in a public repository like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket, nor is there any other information pointing to where the code might be found. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
