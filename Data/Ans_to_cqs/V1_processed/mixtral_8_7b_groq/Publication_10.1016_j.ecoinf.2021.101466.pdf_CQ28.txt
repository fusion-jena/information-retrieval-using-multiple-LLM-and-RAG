The provided pieces of context do not contain information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context focuses on the methods and techniques used for object detection and classification, such as the use of the YOLOv4 and EfficientNet models, random erasing data augmentation, and hierarchical classification. However, it does not mention any details about the cloud platform or infrastructure where the model was deployed. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
