The provided context does not give specific information about the deep learning framework used to build the model for detecting man-made underwater objects. Therefore, I cannot give a definitive answer to this query.

However, the paper by Abu and Diamant (2022) mentions using a deep learning model for underwater object detection, but they do not specify the framework used. Similarly, the paper by Çalışkan (2023) uses deep learning models for detecting human activity types from 3D posture data, but again, the specific framework is not mentioned.

Deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras are widely used in the machine learning and data science communities. TensorFlow is a popular open-source library developed by Google Brain, while PyTorch is a machine learning library developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. Keras is another popular deep learning library that can run on top of TensorFlow or Theano.

In summary, while the provided context does not specify the deep learning framework used for building the model for detecting man-made underwater objects, popular frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras.
