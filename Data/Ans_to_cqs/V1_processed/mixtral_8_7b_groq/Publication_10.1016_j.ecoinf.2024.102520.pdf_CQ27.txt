Based on the provided context, there is no information about the training and deployment of a deep learning model. The context mainly discusses various topics related to agriculture, ecology, and soil substrates.

However, I can provide some general steps that are typically involved in deploying a trained deep learning model:

1. Model Serialization: Once the deep learning model has been trained and validated, it is essential to save the model's architecture and weights so that it can be loaded and used for making predictions. Model serialization involves saving the model as a file on disk, which can be done using various formats such as HDF5, JSON, or YAML.
2. Platform Selection: The choice of platform for deploying the deep learning model depends on the use case and the infrastructure available. Popular platforms for deploying deep learning models include cloud-based services such as AWS SageMaker, Google Cloud AI Platform, and Microsoft Azure Machine Learning. On-premises solutions such as Kubernetes and Docker can also be used for deploying deep learning models.
3. Model Serving: Model serving involves deploying the trained deep learning model as a web service or API, which can be used to make predictions. Model serving frameworks such as TensorFlow Serving, TorchServe, and Clipper can be used for serving deep learning models.
4. Model Monitoring and Maintenance: Once the deep learning model has been deployed, it is essential to monitor its performance and make updates as necessary. Model monitoring involves tracking metrics such as accuracy, latency, and throughput. Model maintenance involves retraining the model with new data, updating the model's architecture, or deploying a new model.

Therefore, while the provided context does not contain information on the specific process followed to deploy a deep learning model, the above steps provide a general overview of the process involved in deploying a trained deep learning model.
