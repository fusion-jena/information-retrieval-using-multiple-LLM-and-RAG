The provided context discusses the calculation of remotely sensed metrics for inferring biophysical characteristics of the environment, but it does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. However, it does mention some metrics that are commonly used in the context of remote sensing and image analysis, such as mean, median, standard deviation, and textural metrics.

In the context of deep learning model performance evaluation, metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are commonly used. Accuracy is the ratio of correct predictions to the total number of predictions. Precision is the ratio of true positives (correctly predicted positive instances) to the total number of positive predictions. Recall is the ratio of true positives to the total number of actual positive instances. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and provides a single metric that balances both.

It's important to note that the choice of evaluation metric depends on the specific problem and the business or research objectives. For example, if the cost of a false negative is much higher than a false positive, recall may be a more important metric than precision.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model, it does mention some metrics that are commonly used in the context of remote sensing and image analysis. In the context of deep learning model performance evaluation, metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are commonly used.
