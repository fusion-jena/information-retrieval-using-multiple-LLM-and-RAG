The provided context does not include information about the specific optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The text discusses various factors that affect soil thaw depth, such as snow depth, soil density, soil water content, solar radiation, thermal conductivity, vegetation height, and others. It also mentions different algorithms and methods used for evaluating and modeling these factors, such as Bayesian networks, conditional probabilities, and the Lauritzen-Spiegelhalter algorithm. However, it does not provide information on optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
