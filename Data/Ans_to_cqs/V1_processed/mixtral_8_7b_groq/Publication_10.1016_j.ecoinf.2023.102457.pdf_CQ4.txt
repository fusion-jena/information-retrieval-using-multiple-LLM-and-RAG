Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling being applied in the described deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the use of pre-trained models, specifically VGGish, BirdNET, and Wav2Vec 2.0, for extracting embeddings from gibbon vocalizations. It also discusses the potential of training a model on gibbon vocalizations for better performance, but it does not mention any data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide specific details on data augmentation techniques applied in this pipeline.
