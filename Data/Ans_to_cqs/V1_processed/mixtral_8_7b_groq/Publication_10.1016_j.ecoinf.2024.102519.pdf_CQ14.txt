The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using genetic optimization algorithms, as stated in the provided context. However, it does not specify the exact method used, such as grid search or random search. Genetic algorithms are a type of optimization algorithm that are based on the principles of natural selection and genetics. They involve creating an initial population of solutions, which are then iteratively improved through processes such as selection, crossover, and mutation.

In the context provided, the genetic algorithm is used to determine the algorithm parameters for identifying the optimal ecological source area (ESA) for landslide susceptibility prediction. The ESA identification process is a multicondition optimization problem, and the genetic algorithm is used to adjust the hyperparameters based on three key factors: source area, distance from the center of the area, and the importance value of the ESA.

The genetic algorithm is implemented by programming in Python, and the main steps of the optimization process are outlined in the context. However, the specific method used to optimize the hyperparameters is not specified. It is possible that the authors of the study developed a custom optimization method using genetic algorithms, or they may have used a existing library or framework that implements genetic algorithms.

In summary, the hyperparameters of the model are optimized using genetic optimization algorithms, but the specific method used is not specified in the provided context.
