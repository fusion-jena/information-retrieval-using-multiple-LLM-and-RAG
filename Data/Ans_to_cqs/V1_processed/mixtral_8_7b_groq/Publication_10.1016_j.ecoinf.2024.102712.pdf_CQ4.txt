Based on the provided context, there is no information about the specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling that were applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the use of Sentinel-2 data and other types of data in a model-assisted framework and hierarchical modeling for predicting above-ground biomass (AGB) in Betul forest. It mentions the use of the R package leaps for variable selection and the creation of an AGBD map with a cell size of 100m. However, it does not mention any data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
