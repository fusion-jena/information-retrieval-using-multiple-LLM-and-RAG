The provided context does not give specific information about the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the authors used Landsat 8 imagery with a spatial resolution of 30 meters for bands 1-7 and 9, 15 meters for band 8, and 100 meters for bands 10 and 11. They did not use Landsat-7 imagery due to the data gaps observed in images acquired after 2003.

The authors also mention that they achieved high overall accuracy (97%) in mapping burn scars in the Cerrado biome in Brazil using a semi-automated technique, remotely sensed data, and deep learning algorithm available on Google Cloud Storage and Computing. They attribute these results to the geometrically corrected and preprocessed Landsat data available on the Google Earth Engine Platform and the capacity of Deep Learning techniques to differentiate spectral signatures of burned and unburned areas in the study area.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, it is possible that the authors employed some of these methods as part of their preprocessing and data preparation. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query.
