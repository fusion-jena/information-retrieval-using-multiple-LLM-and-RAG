The provided pieces of context do not explicitly mention the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline. However, they do discuss the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence models in various studies related to environmental management and water quality.

In the study "Analysis of input set characteristics and variances on k-fold cross validation for a recurrent neural network model on waste disposal rate estimation" (Vu, Ng, Richter, An, 2022), the authors use a recurrent neural network model to estimate waste disposal rates. While the specific dataset used in this study is not mentioned, it can be inferred that the dataset is related to waste disposal rates.

The study "Application of VNIR and machine learning technologies to predict heavy metals in soil and pollution indices in mining areas" (Wang, Zhao, Xu, 2022) uses a dataset related to heavy metals in soil and mining areas. The authors use machine learning models to predict heavy metals in soil and pollution indices.

In the study "Restoring water quality in the polluted urban waterways of Dhaka, Bangladesh" (Whitehead, Bussi, Hossain, Dolk, Das, Comber, Peters, Charles, Hope, Hossain, 2018), the authors use a dataset related to water quality in the polluted urban waterways of Dhaka, Bangladesh. The authors use machine learning models to assess water quality.

Therefore, while the provided pieces of context do not explicitly mention the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, they do discuss the use of machine learning models in various studies related to environmental management and water quality. The datasets used in these studies are related to waste disposal rates, heavy metals in soil and mining areas, and water quality in urban waterways.
