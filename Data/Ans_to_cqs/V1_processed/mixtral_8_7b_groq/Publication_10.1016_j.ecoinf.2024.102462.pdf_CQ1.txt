In the deep learning (DL) pipeline for sub-alpine shrub species identification, raw data is collected through fieldwork expeditions and an observer study. Fieldwork missions were conducted to capture images of the shrubs, with three expeditions carried out in 2021 (June, August, and October) to account for seasonal changes in color and flowering patterns. This approach allowed for the collection of high-quality annotated data, which is crucial for developing a DL model capable of matching human expertise. The study site, methodology for data acquisition, and distribution of sub-alpine vegetation were carefully considered in this process.

In addition to fieldwork, an observer study was also utilized. However, the specific details of this method are not provided in the context. It can be inferred that the observer study likely involves human experts observing and identifying the shrub species, contributing to the annotated dataset used for training the DL networks.

It is important to note that deep learning models are often referred to as "data hungry" because their accuracy is heavily dependent on the amount and quality of annotated data used for training. Thus, the careful collection and annotation of raw data are essential steps in the DL pipeline.

Public datasets were not explicitly mentioned as a source of raw data in this context. However, it is common practice in DL to utilize publicly available datasets when applicable, as they can provide a large and diverse set of annotated data for training.

In summary, the raw data for the DL pipeline in sub-alpine shrub species identification is collected through fieldwork expeditions and an observer study, ensuring a high-quality and accurately annotated dataset for training the DL networks.
