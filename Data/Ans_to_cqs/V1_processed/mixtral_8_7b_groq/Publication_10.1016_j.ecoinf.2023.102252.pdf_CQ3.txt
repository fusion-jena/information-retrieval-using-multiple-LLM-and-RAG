The provided context does not contain information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context is about the development of a computationally efficient floodplain ecological response model for large-scale, data-sparse riparian environments. The keywords are environmental flow, riparian ecosystem, wetland, biodiversity maintenance, and computational requirements. The article's authors are J. Teng, B. Croke, D. Tan, T. Iwanaga, A.J. Jakeman, C. Pollino, D. Stratford, J. Vaze, W. Dawes, P. Bridgeman, and A. Sengupta. The article is published in the Ecological Informatics journal.

Therefore, I don't have the information to answer the query about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. I apologize for any inconvenience.
