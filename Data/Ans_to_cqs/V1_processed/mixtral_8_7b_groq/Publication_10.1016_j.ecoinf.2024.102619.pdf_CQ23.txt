The generalizability of the deep learning model was ensured through several measures, including the use of a diverse dataset, cross-validation, and hyperparameter optimization.

Firstly, the dataset used for training the model consisted of images with different illumination patterns, which increased the diversity of the data and helped the model to learn from various lighting conditions. This diversity in the dataset contributed to the model's ability to generalize well to new, unseen data.

Secondly, cross-validation was employed to assess the performance of the model and prevent overfitting. Specifically, a k-fold cross-validation approach was used, where the dataset was divided into k subsets or "folds." The model was then trained on k-1 folds while the remaining fold was used for testing. This process was repeated k times, with each fold serving as the test set once. The final performance of the model was reported as the average performance across all k folds. This cross-validation approach helped to ensure that the model's performance was not overestimated and that it could generalize well to new data.

Thirdly, hyperparameter optimization was carried out to find the optimal set of hyperparameters for the model. Hyperparameters are parameters that are not learned from the data but are set before training. For example, the learning rate, the number of hidden layers, and the number of units in each layer are all hyperparameters. The optimal hyperparameters were found using a grid search approach, where a range of possible values for each hyperparameter was tested, and the combination of hyperparameters that resulted in the best performance was selected. This hyperparameter optimization process helped to ensure that the model was not overfitting the training data and could generalize well to new data.

In summary, the generalizability of the deep learning model was ensured through the use of a diverse dataset, cross-validation, and hyperparameter optimization. These measures helped to prevent overfitting and ensured that the model could perform well on new, unseen data.
