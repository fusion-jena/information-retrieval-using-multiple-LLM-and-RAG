Based on the provided context, there is no information about any type of deep learning model, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers, being used in the described pipeline. The text only mentions the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) as one of the machine learning approaches for training individual models. However, ANNs are not deep learning models per se, but rather a broad category that includes deep learning models as well as other types of neural networks with a single layer or a few layers.

Therefore, it is not possible to determine the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline based on the given context.
