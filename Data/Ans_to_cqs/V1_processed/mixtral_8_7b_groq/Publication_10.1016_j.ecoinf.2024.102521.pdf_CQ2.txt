The deep learning pipeline described in the context utilizes several data formats, primarily involving image and CSV files.

1. Image files: The pipeline primarily works with image files, specifically in JPEG format, as mentioned in the STARdbi\_inference input section. These image files can be trap images used for insect detection or insect images extracted from trap images based on bounding box coordinates and annotations.
2. CSV files: Bounding box information and annotations associated with trap image files are stored in CSV files. Each line in the CSV file corresponds to a bounding box, containing trap image file information, coordinates (in pixels), and a species label, which may be empty.

While there is no explicit mention of audio or video files in the provided context, the pipeline primarily focuses on image-based deep learning tasks for insect detection and extraction. The CSV files are used to store metadata and annotations related to the image files.
