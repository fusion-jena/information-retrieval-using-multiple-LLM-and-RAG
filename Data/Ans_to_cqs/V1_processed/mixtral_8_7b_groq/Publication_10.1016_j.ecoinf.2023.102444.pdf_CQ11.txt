The provided context does not include information about a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The study mentioned the application of UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) for estimating species distribution based on an analysis of bioclimatic variables. However, there is no information on where the data or code for this pipeline is stored or shared.

The study used a dataset of 1071 target species and selected bioclimatic variables for each species. They also mentioned other studies that used dimensionality reduction methods (DRM) such as Deneu et al. (2022) who used tSNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) to visualize input data and the results of applying a convolutional neural network to model the distribution of species at a fine resolution.

However, the context does not provide a link to the data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. It is possible that the data and code for the pipeline are available upon request from the authors or through a different platform.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to the data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study.
