The dataset used for deep learning model training was split based on the presence of Pacific oysters in the tiles. Specifically, the tiles containing Pacific oysters were divided into 70% for training and 30% for validation. This means that a larger proportion of the dataset with oysters was used for training the models, which could help improve their ability to detect oysters.

Additionally, data augmentation was used to increase the size of the training dataset. Five augmented images were created for each original tile, resulting in an additional 5735 tiles split between the two sites. Data augmentation involved random variations and manipulations to the data, such as flipping, cropping, adjusting contrast, translating, and rotating the images. These augmentations were applied in a random order to create a more diverse training dataset.

It's worth noting that the validation dataset was not augmented, as it was used to evaluate the performance of the trained models. By using a separate validation dataset, the researchers could assess how well the models generalized to new, unseen data.

Overall, the dataset was split based on the presence of Pacific oysters, and data augmentation was used to increase the size of the training dataset. These criteria allowed the researchers to train and evaluate deep learning models for detecting Pacific oysters in aerial imagery.
