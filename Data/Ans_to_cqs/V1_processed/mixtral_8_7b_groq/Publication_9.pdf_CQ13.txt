The provided context does not give specific details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model training procedure involves stochastic gradient descent with backpropagation, which are methods for optimizing the model weights. The learning rate, which is a common hyperparameter in many optimization algorithms, is not explicitly mentioned. The COCO dataset, which is used as a backbone for training, is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset. It is often used as a starting point for recognition tasks with deep learning. The VGG Image Annotator (VIA) was used to manually annotate pixel coordinates for precise organismal segmentation masks. These masks were then used to train a CNN pre-trained on ImageNet. The utility of pre-trained CNNs is constrained by how relevant the novel input data are to the data the CNN was originally trained on. Therefore, the specific hyperparameters used in the model's training process would depend on the specific implementation and requirements of the task.
