In the deep learning pipeline, the optimization technique applied is the Adam algorithm, which is a type of stochastic gradient descent method (SGD). The Adam algorithm is a popular optimization technique in deep learning due to its ability to adaptively adjust the learning rate for each parameter during training. This can help to improve the convergence and generalization performance of the model.

In addition to the choice of optimizer, other hyperparameters that control the training process were also adjusted in the deep learning pipeline. These hyperparameters include the learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs. The learning rate determines the step size at each iteration of the optimization process, while the batch size determines the number of training examples used in each update of the model parameters. The number of epochs determines the number of times the training data is passed through the model during training.

It is worth noting that the choice of hyperparameters can have a significant impact on the performance of the deep learning model. In contrast to other families of machine learning models that have a narrow range of hyperparameters to adjust, ANN are defined by different types of hyperparameters. This can make the optimization process more challenging, as there are more hyperparameters to tune. However, by carefully selecting and adjusting these hyperparameters, it is possible to improve the performance of the deep learning model.

In the deep learning pipeline described in the context, the hyperparameters were initially defined within a small dimensional space and explored with the original variables. This approach can help to avoid an exhaustive search that could consume a lot of time.

Overall, the Adam algorithm and other hyperparameters were adjusted in the deep learning pipeline to optimize the model's performance. By carefully selecting and adjusting these hyperparameters, it is possible to improve the convergence and generalization performance of the deep learning model.
