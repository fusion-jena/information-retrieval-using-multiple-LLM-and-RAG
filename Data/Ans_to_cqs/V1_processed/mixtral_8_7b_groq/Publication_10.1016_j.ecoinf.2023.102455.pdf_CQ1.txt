The provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the models are used to create a multi-temporal forecasting model of daily streamflow (Qflow), which implies that the data is likely collected from sensors or other sources that provide time-series data.

The context also mentions that the models are used for "the absence of streamflow information as input modeling, during the flood seasons to reduce flood damage in residential areas", which further suggests that the data is likely collected from sensors or other sources that measure streamflow.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of "climate signals" in the forecasting of streamflow, which could imply that the data is collected from various sources that measure different aspects of climate, such as temperature, precipitation, and humidity.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data, it does imply that the data is likely collected from sensors or other sources that provide time-series data on streamflow and climate signals.
