The provided context does not give specific information about the learning rate and optimizer used in the deep learning model. However, it does mention some details about the architecture and parameters used in the models. For instance, the VGG19 network architecture was used, and a residual unit with a short-circuit mechanism was added. The models were configured with an Input shape of (64, 64, band\_num), and the weights were set to None. A combination model (VGG19 + ResNet50) was created using Concatenate() to merge the features from VGG19 and ResNet50.

The models had several layers including Dropout(Dropout\_Rate), Dense(256, activation='relu'), Dropout(Dropout\_Rate), and finally, one Dense(8, activation='softmax') layer. The data was prepared in a specific way, including spectral segmentation and band selection. Data augmentation and flattened convolution kernels were used in one of the optimal simulation results.

Therefore, while the specific learning rate and optimizer used in the model are not provided in the context, we can infer that the models were configured with specific input shapes, dropout rates, and dense layers, and that data augmentation and flattened convolution kernels were used in some of the experiments.
