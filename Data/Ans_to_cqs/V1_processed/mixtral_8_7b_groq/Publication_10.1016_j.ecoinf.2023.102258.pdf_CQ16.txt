The text provided does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the sound event detection challenge. However, it does mention that participants used the development set, which consists of a training set and a validation set, to build and refine their systems. It is common in machine learning tasks to use a validation set to check the performance of a model during training and to help determine when training should be stopped. One common approach is to stop training when the validation loss plateaus or starts to increase, indicating that the model is overfitting to the training data. However, the specific criteria used in this challenge are not mentioned in the text.
