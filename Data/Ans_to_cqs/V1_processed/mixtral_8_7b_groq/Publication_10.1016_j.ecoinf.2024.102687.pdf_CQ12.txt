The deep learning models used in the pipeline are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Specifically, four CNN backbones, ResNet18, VGG16, DenseNet121, and AlexNet, are used. These models were pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and then fine-tuned for the specific task of eco-acoustic classification.
