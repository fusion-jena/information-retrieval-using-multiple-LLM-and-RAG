The provided pieces of context do not directly discuss strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, they do describe the use of deep learning and other computational methods in the context of mapping and analyzing mining activities.

In the paper by Couttenier et al. (2022), the authors use a deep learning model to map artisanal and small-scale mines (ASGM) at a large scale from space. They do not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value or other strategies to handle randomness in their deep learning pipeline. However, they do emphasize the importance of using a large and diverse training dataset to ensure the accuracy and robustness of their model.

Similarly, the paper by Elmes et al. (2020) describes the use of a Sentinel-2 based multispectral convolutional neural network to detect ASGM in Ghana. While they do not discuss strategies for handling randomness, they do highlight the need for careful preprocessing and feature engineering to improve the performance of their model.

In general, the use of a random seed value is a common strategy for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. By setting a fixed seed value, researchers can ensure that the random initialization of model parameters and other stochastic processes are reproducible, allowing for more reliable comparisons and evaluations of different models.

In summary, while the provided pieces of context do not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, they do highlight the importance of using large and diverse training datasets, as well as careful preprocessing and feature engineering, to ensure the accuracy and robustness of deep learning models for mapping and analyzing mining activities. Additionally, the use of a random seed value is a common strategy for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, although it is not specifically mentioned in the provided context.
