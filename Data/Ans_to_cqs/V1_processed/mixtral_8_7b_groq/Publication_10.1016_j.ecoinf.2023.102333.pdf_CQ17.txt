The primary regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, as mentioned in the provided context, is dropout regularization. Dropout regularization is a technique where different sets of neurons are randomly removed during training, resulting in the creation of multiple sub-networks. This process reduces overfitting and statistical noise by providing a robust and diverse set of features for the model to learn from.

L2 regularization is not explicitly mentioned in the context; however, it is a commonly used regularization technique in deep learning. L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, which encourages the model to have smaller weights, thereby reducing overfitting.

The context also highlights the importance of other hyperparameters and techniques for optimizing the deep neural network architecture. These include the number of layers and nodes, learning rate, and optimization algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and its variant with momentum. Additionally, recent studies have evaluated different techniques for tuning hyperparameters, such as activation functions, like Exponential Linear Unit (ELU), which addresses ReLU limitations like dead neurons and slow convergence.

In summary, dropout regularization is the primary method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, as mentioned in the provided context. However, other regularization techniques like L2 regularization and optimization methods can also contribute to reducing overfitting and improving the overall performance of deep learning models.
