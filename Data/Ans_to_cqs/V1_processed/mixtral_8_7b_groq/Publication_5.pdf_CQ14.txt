The hyperparameters of the deep learning model used for species richness estimation were optimized using a method called grid search parameter tuning. In this method, a finite set of values for each hyperparameter is chosen, and all possible combinations of these values are tried to find the best set of hyperparameters for the model.

Before training the model, there are several hyperparameters that need to be tuned, but there are common sets of rules or heuristics governing parameter tuning. After iterative grid search parameter tuning, using a small subset of the data, the model was found to perform best with 5 hidden layers (Hj, j=1,2,â‹¯,5) and an unspecified number of neurons (n) in each layer.

Unfortunately, the context does not provide more specific details about the grid search process or the range of values tried for each hyperparameter. However, it is mentioned that a statistical feature importance test (SFIT) was performed to explain which feature had the greatest significance in the species richness retrievals and to determine the optimized features in an operational retrieval system. This test involved randomly shuffling a single feature while keeping all other features constant, and iterating this process by changing the test variable. The feature importance was then determined by the extent to which the model performance decreased with random shuffling.

It is worth noting that the deep learning model was compared to a random forest model in terms of statistical accuracy metrics, and the deep learning model outperformed the random forest model in terms of mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and correlation. However, the deep learning model had a higher bias than the random forest model.

In summary, the hyperparameters of the deep learning model used for species richness estimation were optimized using grid search parameter tuning, but the specific details of this process are not provided in the context. The model was found to perform best with 5 hidden layers and an unspecified number of neurons in each layer. A statistical feature importance test was also performed to determine the optimized features in an operational retrieval system.
