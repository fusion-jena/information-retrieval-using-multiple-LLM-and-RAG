Based on the provided context, there are no specific details about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline for flood susceptibility mapping. However, in general, data augmentation techniques commonly used in deep learning include flipping, rotation, and scaling.

Flipping is a technique that involves flipping the input data horizontally or vertically to increase the size of the training dataset. This technique can help the model generalize better, especially when dealing with objects that have symmetrical features.

Rotation is another technique that involves rotating the input data by a certain angle. This technique can help the model learn to recognize objects from different angles and orientations, making it more robust to variations in the input data.

Scaling is a technique that involves resizing the input data by a certain factor. This technique can help the model learn to recognize objects of different sizes, making it more versatile in handling inputs of varying scales.

In addition to these techniques, other data augmentation methods such as cropping, brightness adjustment, and adding noise can also be used to further increase the diversity of the training dataset and improve the model's performance.

Therefore, while the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for flood susceptibility mapping are not mentioned in the provided context, it is likely that some or all of the above-mentioned techniques were used to enhance the model's ability to handle variations in the input data.
