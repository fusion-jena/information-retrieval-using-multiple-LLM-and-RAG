The deep learning pipeline can use various data formats, including image, audio, video, and CSV files. The specific data format used depends on the problem being addressed and the type of deep learning model being implemented.

For instance, in the context of predicting cotton leaf curl virus (CLCuD) in upland cotton, the researchers used image data as input to the deep learning models. Specifically, they used a dataset of cotton leaf images to train and test their models. The images were preprocessed and then fed into the deep learning models, such as the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and the convolutional neural network (CNN), to predict the severity of CLCuD.

In another study, the researchers used CSV files as input to their deep learning model. The CSV files contained data on environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall, and their impact on the development of CLCuD. The deep learning model, a mathematical model of the begomovirus of CLCuD, was trained on this data to understand the relationship between environmental factors and the disease's development.

Deep learning models can also handle audio and video data. For example, in speech recognition, deep learning models can use audio data as input to transcribe speech into text. Similarly, in video analysis, deep learning models can use video data as input to recognize objects, detect motion, and understand scenes.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline can use various data formats, including image, audio, video, and CSV files. The specific data format used depends on the problem being addressed and the type of deep learning model being implemented. In the context of predicting CLCuD in upland cotton, image data was used as input to the deep learning models. However, other studies have shown that deep learning models can also handle audio, video, and CSV files as input.
