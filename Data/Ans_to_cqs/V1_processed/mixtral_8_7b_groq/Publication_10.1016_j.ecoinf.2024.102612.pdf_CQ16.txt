The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific criterion used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that metrics such as MIoU (Mean Intersection over Union) or MA (Mean Accuracy) were computed after each epoch during the training of the SoftGroup architecture. These metrics were used to analyze the training performance. Once trained, the configuration weights that achieved the best classification performance were selected to establish the reference trained model. This selected model was then used to perform predictions on real MS point clouds, i.e., the ground truth data. Therefore, it can be inferred that the training was completed based on the best classification performance as indicated by the MIoU or MA metrics. However, the specific criterion for determining the completion of training, such as a validation loss plateau, is not provided in the context.
