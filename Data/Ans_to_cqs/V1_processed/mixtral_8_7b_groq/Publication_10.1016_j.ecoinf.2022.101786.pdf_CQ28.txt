The provided context does not explicitly mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that Google Colaboratory was used for building and training the model. Google Colaboratory, also known as Google Colab, is a free cloud service provided by Google that allows users to write and execute Python code in their web browser. It provides a Jupyter notebook-like environment and comes with free access to a GPU or TPU, making it a popular choice for machine learning and deep learning tasks.

However, the context does not specify whether the trained model was deployed on Google Cloud Platform or any other cloud platform. It is also possible that the model was deployed on-premise or on a local machine. Therefore, while we can infer that Google Colaboratory was used for building and training the model, the platform for model deployment remains unknown based on the provided context.
