The provided context does not give information about how raw data is collected in the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text focuses on the description of the methods and techniques used for training deep learning models for object detection and action recognition, such as the use of a pretrained Mask R-CNN backbone, data augmentation techniques, and the ResNet variants. The context also mentions the datasets used for training, which are COCO 2017train dataset for the Mask R-CNN and Kinetics-400 dataset for the ResNets, but it does not provide information on how these datasets were originally collected or created. Therefore, it is not possible to answer this query based on the given context.
