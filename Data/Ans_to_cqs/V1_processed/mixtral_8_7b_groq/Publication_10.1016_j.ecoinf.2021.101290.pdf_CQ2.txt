Based on the provided context, the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned. However, we can infer that audio data is likely used in the deep learning pipeline described in the text. This is because the text discusses a system for automatically annotating and analyzing data online, specifically mentioning the use of a microphone array to collect sound data and the processing of this sound data in the form of power contents and onset/offset events. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the deep learning pipeline in this case involves processing audio data, although the specific format (e.g., WAV, MP3, etc.) is not specified.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of machine learning, computer vision, and artificial intelligence for automated annotation and analysis. While these techniques are not limited to any specific data format, they are often used with image and video data in the context of deep learning. Therefore, it is possible that image or video data are also used in this pipeline, although this is not explicitly stated in the provided context.

In summary, while the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, we can infer that audio data is likely used, and it is possible that image or video data are also used.
