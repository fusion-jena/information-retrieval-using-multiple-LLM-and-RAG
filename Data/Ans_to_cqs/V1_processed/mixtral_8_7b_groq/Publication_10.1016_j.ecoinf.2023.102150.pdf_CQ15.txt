The optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the provided context are the Adam optimizer and a one-cycle learning rate policy.

The Adam optimizer is a type of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization method that is used to update the weights of the neural network during training. It is an extension of the standard stochastic gradient descent algorithm and is known for its efficiency and simplicity. The Adam optimizer uses the past gradients to adapt the learning rate, making it suitable for problems with sparse gradients or noisy data.

The one-cycle learning rate policy is a learning rate scheduling technique that gradually increases the learning rate from a small value to a larger value and then decreases it back to a small value. This policy helps the model to escape from local minima and improve the generalization of the model. The one-cycle policy is used with a minimum learning rate of 0.000001 and a maximum learning rate of 0.001.

These optimization techniques are used in the deep learning pipeline to train a deep neural network for the classification of camera trap images. The network is trained for 55 epochs with the ResNet50 architecture, and image augmentation is applied to expand the training data. The Adam optimizer and the one-cycle learning rate policy are used to improve the training process and the performance of the model.
