The provided context does not give specific details about the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of satellite remote sensing data for predicting forest canopy cover. This implies that satellite imagery is one source of raw data used in the studies discussed.

In the context, several machine learning models are mentioned as having been used to predict canopy cover from planet data. These models include Enet, SVM, RF, XGboost, and LightGBM. While the context does not explicitly state that satellite imagery was the input to these models, it is a reasonable assumption given the overall topic of the studies.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of "surveys" in a different study, but it is not clear whether these surveys were used to collect raw data for a machine learning or deep learning pipeline or for some other purpose.

In summary, while the provided context does not give a comprehensive answer to the query, it does suggest that satellite remote sensing data and possibly surveys are sources of raw data used in studies involving machine learning models for predicting forest canopy cover.
