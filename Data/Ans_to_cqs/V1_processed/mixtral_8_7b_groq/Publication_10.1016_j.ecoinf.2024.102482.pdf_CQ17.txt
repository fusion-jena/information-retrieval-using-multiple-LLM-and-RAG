The provided context discusses the use of a dropout layer as a regularization method to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does not explicitly mention other regularization techniques such as L2 regularization.

In the system structure described, a dropout layer is incorporated into the model to reduce overfitting and improve generalization. Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly sets a fraction of input units to 0 during training, which helps prevent over-reliance on specific neurons and encourages the model to learn more robust features (Srividya et al., 2021).

The context does not mention L2 regularization explicitly. L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function, which is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This penalty term discourages large weight values, promoting a simpler model and reducing overfitting (Ren, 2020).

It is important to note that deep learning models like LSTM can be prone to overfitting due to their complexity and the limited amount of available data in bio-monitoring systems. Thus, the use of regularization techniques, such as dropout and L2 regularization, is crucial to improve model generalization and prevent overfitting (Prasad et al., 2021).

In summary, the provided context mentions the use of dropout as a regularization method to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does not explicitly discuss L2 regularization. Nonetheless, L2 regularization is an essential regularization technique that can be applied alongside dropout to enhance model generalization and prevent overfitting in deep learning models.
