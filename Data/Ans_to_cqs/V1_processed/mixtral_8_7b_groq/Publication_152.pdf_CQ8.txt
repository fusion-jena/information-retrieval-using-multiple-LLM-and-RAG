The provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The sources mainly focus on the methodology, results, and applications of the U-Net convolutional network in classifying invasive vegetation species using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images.

The study by Wagner et al. (2019) discusses the use of U-Net for mapping forest types and disturbances in the Atlantic Rainforest with very high-resolution images. However, there is no mention of the code repository. Similarly, Ronneberger et al. (2015) introduced U-Net for biomedical image segmentation, but the context does not provide information about the code repository for this deep learning pipeline.

The paper by Kitano et al. (2019) uses deep learning and UAV images for corn plant counting, but again, there is no information about the code repository for their deep learning pipeline.

Although the methodology and implementation details are provided, the sources do not mention where the code repository is available. Therefore, it is not possible to answer this query without additional information.
