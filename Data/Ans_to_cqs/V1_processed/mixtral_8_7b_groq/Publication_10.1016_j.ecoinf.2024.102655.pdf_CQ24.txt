Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, there are descriptions of various machine learning models and data pre-processing techniques used in water quality prediction.

In the context of data pre-processing, Casillas-Garc√≠a et al. (2021) employed an outlier detection and artificial data replacement process. This process might involve some level of randomness, but it is not explicitly stated.

In the context of machine learning models, Chen et al. (2023) used a model combining Artificial Bee Colony and Back Propagation Neural Network algorithms, while Wang et al. (2023) applied variational mode decomposition to decompose water quality data into relatively stable components before training a LSTM neural network. These approaches do not directly address the handling of randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

However, in general deep learning practices, the use of a random seed value is a common strategy to handle randomness. By setting a specific seed value, the random number generator used in the deep learning pipeline can be initialized to produce the same sequence of random numbers, ensuring reproducibility of results. This is particularly important in processes like weight initialization, data shuffling, and dropout regularization.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it is a common and important practice in deep learning.
