The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific method used to optimize the hyperparameters of the model. However, it does mention that the authors of the mgcv library recommended the method used to estimate the model parameters. The mgcv library is known for its Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) and Generalized Cross-Validation (GCV) for smoothing parameter selection. GCV is a type of automatic hyperparameter tuning method. Therefore, it can be inferred that the hyperparameters of the model were optimized using Generalized Cross-Validation, as recommended by the authors of the mgcv library. However, the context does not mention any other methods such as grid search or random search for hyperparameter tuning.
