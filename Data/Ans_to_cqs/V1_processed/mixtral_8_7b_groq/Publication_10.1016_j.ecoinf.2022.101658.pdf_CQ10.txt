The provided context does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text describes the methodology and results of a project that uses a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) to estimate boreal forest ground cover vegetation composition from nadir photographs. However, it does not give any details about the code repository or where it is located, such as on GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
