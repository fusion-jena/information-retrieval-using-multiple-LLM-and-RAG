The Hybrid Hyperparameter Optimization Scheme (HHOS) algorithm, as described in the context, does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is important to note that randomness is inherent in various stages of deep learning model development, such as data shuffling, weight initialization, and dropout regularization. While the HHOS algorithm does not directly address the use of a random seed value, it employs strategies to manage variability and improve the chances of finding optimal hyperparameters.

One way the HHOS algorithm deals with randomness is by combining manual and random search methods. In the manual search phase, the authors use frequently used hyperparameter configurations from related studies to identify optimal hyperparameter values and reduce the search space. This approach helps minimize the impact of randomness by leveraging prior knowledge and empirical evidence.

In the random search phase, the algorithm iteratively samples various combinations of hyperparameter values from the reduced search space and trains models with each set. This process allows the HHOS algorithm to explore a wider range of hyperparameter configurations while accounting for the randomness introduced during training.

Additionally, the HHOS algorithm acknowledges the limitations and potential biases of the training dataset, which can contribute to variability in model performance. By emphasizing the importance of collecting more comprehensive and diverse datasets, the authors indirectly address the issue of randomness stemming from data limitations.

In summary, while the HHOS algorithm does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value, it employs strategies to manage randomness in the deep learning pipeline. These strategies include leveraging prior knowledge in the manual search phase, exploring a wide range of hyperparameter configurations in the random search phase, and acknowledging the impact of dataset limitations on model performance.
