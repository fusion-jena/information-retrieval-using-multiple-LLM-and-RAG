The provided context discusses the use of deep learning techniques for identifying a small number of classes with limited labeled images in various fields, including fisheries and limnology. However, it does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

Nevertheless, I can provide some common data annotation techniques used in deep learning:

1. Image-level annotation: In this technique, an image is annotated with a single label indicating the class to which the entire image belongs. This is the simplest form of annotation and is useful when the goal is to classify images into different categories.

2. Bounding box annotation: Here, a bounding box is drawn around each object of interest in an image. Each bounding box is associated with a class label indicating the object it contains. Bounding box annotation is useful for object detection tasks where the goal is to locate objects within an image and classify them.

3. Semantic segmentation: In semantic segmentation, each pixel in an image is assigned a class label indicating the object it belongs to. This technique is useful for image segmentation tasks where the goal is to partition an image into multiple regions based on the objects present in the image.

4. Instance segmentation: Instance segmentation is an extension of semantic segmentation where each instance of an object is segmented and assigned a unique identifier. This technique is useful for tasks where the goal is to identify and segment individual objects in an image, even if they belong to the same class.

5. Class-agnostic bounding box annotation: In this technique, bounding boxes are drawn around objects of interest in an image, but the class labels are not provided. Instead, the deep learning model is trained to learn generic features of objects and localize them in an image.

The choice of data annotation technique depends on the specific task and the desired output. For example, if the goal is to classify underwater videos into different fish species, as mentioned in the paper by Siddiqui et al. (2018), then semantic or instance segmentation may be useful for annotating the images. On the other hand, if the goal is to identify individual Eurasian perch by their stripe patterns, as mentioned in the paper by Hirsch and Eckmann (2015), then bounding box annotation or class-agnostic bounding box annotation may be more appropriate.
