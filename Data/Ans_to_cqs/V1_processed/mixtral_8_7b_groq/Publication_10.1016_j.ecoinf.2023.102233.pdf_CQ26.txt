Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention a technique used to address data bias during the evaluation stage.

A random selection approach, stratified across the model's predictions (logits), was used to reduce class imbalance within the evaluation data and allow for the calculation of reliable evaluation metrics. This approach substantially reduced class imbalance within the evaluation data. However, the nature of this approach alters the distribution of data and prohibits evaluation metrics from being generalized to the unlabelled data.

In addition, the context mentions the use of active learning, where audio frames for review are selected based on the model's predictions. This approach was extended to account for a highly imbalanced dataset. While this technique is used during the active learning process and not preprocessing, it is worth noting as it also addresses data bias.

Therefore, the provided context does not directly answer the query, but it does mention a technique used during the evaluation stage to address data bias and a technique used during the active learning process to address data bias.
