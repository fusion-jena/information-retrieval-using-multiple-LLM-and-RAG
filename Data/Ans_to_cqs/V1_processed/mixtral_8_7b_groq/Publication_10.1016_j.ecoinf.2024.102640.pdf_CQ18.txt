The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the performance of the SegFormer model is evaluated after training on the UGE-D dataset, using average Intersection over Union (IOU) and pixel accuracy (PA) metrics for each category: tree, lawn, shrub, and facility. Additionally, the table comparing different models' parameters, Flops, and IOU and PA of classes, suggests that the performance of each model is assessed using these metrics.

Furthermore, the EPDNet model's training process is evaluated using the R2 metric, which measures the model's fit to the observed data. This metric is used to assess the model's performance after training.

Therefore, while the specific strategy for monitoring the model performance during training is not mentioned, it can be inferred that the performance of the models is evaluated using IOU, PA, Flops, and R2 metrics after training.
