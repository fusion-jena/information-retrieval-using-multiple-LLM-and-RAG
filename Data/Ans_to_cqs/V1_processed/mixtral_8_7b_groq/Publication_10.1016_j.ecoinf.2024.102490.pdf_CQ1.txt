The provided context does not give specific details about the data collection methods used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some techniques and tools used in processing and analyzing the data.

The data used in this study is related to the occurrence records of the Campomanesia species, which is a type of plant. The coordinates of these occurrences are georeferenced, indicating that they may have been collected using GPS-enabled devices or surveys.

In addition, the study used bioclimatic layers, which are environmental variables used to predict the potential distribution of species. These layers were cropped using QGIS, a free and open-source geographic information system (GIS) software. This suggests that the bioclimatic layers were obtained from public datasets, possibly from sources such as the WorldClim database.

Once the data is collected and processed, various machine learning algorithms are used to analyze it. These algorithms include XGBOOST, CTA, GLM, GAM, SER, FDA, ANN, GBM, RF, MaxEnt, MARS, and MaxNet. These algorithms are used to predict the climatic suitability for the Campomanesia species based on the collected data.

Therefore, while the context does not provide specific details about the data collection methods, it can be inferred that the data was collected using GPS-enabled devices or surveys and obtained from public datasets.
