Deep learning models can handle various data formats, including images, audio, video, and structured data like CSV files.

Images are commonly used in deep learning applications such as object detection, image classification, and segmentation. Research has shown that Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) can effectively extract ecological information from camera trap images, including species labels, counts, and behaviors (Borowiec et al., 2022; Frank and Volker, 2021; Manuel et al., 2021).

Audio data is used in speech recognition, natural language processing, and other applications. For instance, the Speech-transformer model (Dong et al., 2018) is a no-recurrence sequence-to-sequence model for speech recognition.

Video data is used in applications such as action recognition, object tracking, and video summarization. Video data can be processed using deep learning models such as 3D CNNs and CNN-LSTM architectures.

Structured data, such as CSV files, can also be used in deep learning pipelines. These data formats are typically used in applications such as regression, classification, and time series forecasting. For example, the deep learning model can be used to predict species density based on environmental data collected through field surveys (Delisle et al., 2023).

In summary, deep learning models can handle various data formats, including images, audio, video, and structured data like CSV files. The choice of data format depends on the specific application and the problem being solved.
