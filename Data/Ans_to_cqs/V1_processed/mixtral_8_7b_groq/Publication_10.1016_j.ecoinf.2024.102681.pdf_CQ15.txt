The provided context does not give specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for drought assessment and prediction. However, it does mention that hyperparameters such as the learning rate are considered in the deep learning model.

In general, optimization techniques are crucial in training deep learning models to minimize the error between predicted and actual values. Some popular optimization techniques include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), and Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSprop).

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a simple optimization algorithm that updates the model's parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient of the loss function. SGD is computationally efficient, but it may not always converge to the optimal solution due to its simplicity.

Adam is an optimization algorithm that combines the advantages of SGD and other optimization methods such as Adaptive Gradient Algorithm (AdaGrad) and Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSprop). Adam adjusts the learning rate for each parameter based on the estimated first and second moments of the gradient.

RMSprop is an optimization algorithm that adjusts the learning rate based on the recent history of the gradients. RMSprop divides the learning rate by an exponentially decaying average of squared gradients.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for drought assessment and prediction, it is likely that one or more of these optimization techniques are used to train the model.
