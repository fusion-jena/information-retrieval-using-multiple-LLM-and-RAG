The context provided does not give specific details about how raw data is collected in the deep learning pipeline for satellite image classification. However, it can be inferred that the data used for training deep learning models for satellite image classification is obtained from satellite sensors and public datasets.

In the context, several studies have used satellite images for training their deep learning models. For instance, Unnikrishnan et al. (2019) used red and near-infrared satellite images for land cover classification using deep learning architectures. Similarly, Yuan et al. (2016) used satellite images for congested scene classification via efficient unsupervised feature learning and density estimation. Zhang et al. (2016) also used satellite images for deep learning-based remote sensing image understanding. These studies suggest that satellite sensors are one of the sources of raw data used in the deep learning pipeline for satellite image classification.

Furthermore, some studies have mentioned using public datasets for training their deep learning models. For example, Li et al. (2014) used a free search krill herd algorithm for functions optimization, which suggests that they might have used publicly available datasets for training their model. Similarly, Lunga et al. (2020) presented a new remote sensing data flow for computing huge amounts of remotely sensed images, which implies that they might have used publicly available datasets for their study.

Therefore, it can be inferred that raw data for deep learning-based satellite image classification is collected using satellite sensors and public datasets. However, the specific details of how the data is collected, such as the type of surveys or sensors used, are not provided in the context.
