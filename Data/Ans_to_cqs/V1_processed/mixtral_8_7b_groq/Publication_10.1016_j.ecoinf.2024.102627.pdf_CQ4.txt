Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling being applied in the described deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the use of a deep neural network with a cross-entropy loss function, trained on presence-only samples and using a spatial block hold-out strategy to limit spatial autocorrelation. However, it does not mention any data augmentation techniques. Therefore, according to the given context, the answer to the query is:

There is no information provided about the use of flipping, rotating, scaling, or any other data augmentation techniques in the described deep learning pipeline.
