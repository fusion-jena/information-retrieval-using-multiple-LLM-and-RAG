Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the models are optimized. The context discusses several models and methods, such as AdaLAM, SORT, Deep SORT, Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC), Res2net, and Container, but it does not mention any specific techniques used for hyperparameter optimization, like grid search or random search. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query. However, it is important to note that hyperparameter optimization is a common practice in machine learning and computer vision tasks, and various methods can be used to find the optimal hyperparameters, depending on the specific model and the problem at hand.
