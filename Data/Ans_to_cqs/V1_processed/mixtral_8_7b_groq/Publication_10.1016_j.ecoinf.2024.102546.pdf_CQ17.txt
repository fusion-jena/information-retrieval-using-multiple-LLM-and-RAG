The provided context discusses various aspects of different deep learning pipelines, but it does not explicitly mention the use of regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting. However, it does mention some data augmentation techniques that can help improve model generalization and prevent overfitting.

Data augmentation techniques like jitter, mosaic, random crop, and scale augmentation are used in the deep learning pipelines discussed in the context. Jitter and mosaic augmentations are used in the weed identification pipeline (Wang et al., 2022), while random crop and scale augmentation are implemented in the DINO model (Wang et al., 2023). These techniques can help increase the diversity of the training data and reduce overfitting by creating new training examples through random transformations of the original data.

Another way to prevent overfitting is by using regularization techniques like dropout and L2 regularization. Dropout randomly sets a fraction of the neurons in a layer to zero during training, which helps prevent over-reliance on specific neurons and promotes the development of more robust features. L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function that encourages smaller weights, which can help reduce overfitting by discouraging overly complex models.

While the context does not explicitly mention the use of dropout or L2 regularization, it is possible that these techniques were used in the deep learning pipelines discussed. However, without further information, it is not possible to confirm their use.
