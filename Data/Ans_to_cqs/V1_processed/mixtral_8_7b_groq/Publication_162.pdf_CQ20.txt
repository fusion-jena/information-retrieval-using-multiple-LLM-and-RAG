The context provided does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that the data stream is transmitted to a powerful single-board computer on the base station for preprocessing. This suggests that a high-performance computer is used for data processing and preliminary analysis.

Furthermore, the deep learning model used in the study is a D-Mask R-CNN architecture, which is a complex model that requires significant computational power for training. Typically, such models are trained using specialized hardware, such as GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) or TPUs (Tensor Processing Units), which are designed to handle the high computational demands of deep learning models.

Therefore, while the context does not provide specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, it is reasonable to assume that a high-performance computer with specialized hardware, such as GPUs or TPUs, was used for training the D-Mask R-CNN model.
