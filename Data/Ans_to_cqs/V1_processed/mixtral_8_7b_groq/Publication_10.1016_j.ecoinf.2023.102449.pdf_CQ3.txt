Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the data annotation techniques used in the described deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the architecture and operation of an auto-encoding variational autoencoder (VAE) for soundscape data, but it does not mention any specific data annotation methods.

In general, data annotation techniques for deep learning models can include:

1. Image annotation techniques:
   - Bounding box annotation: Drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest in images.
   - Instance segmentation: Labeling each pixel of an object instance in an image, differentiating it from other object instances and the background.
   - Semantic segmentation: Labeling pixels according to the object class they belong to, without distinguishing between different instances of the same class.
   - Landmark annotation: Identifying and marking key points on objects within images, often used for facial recognition or human pose estimation.

2. Text annotation techniques:
   - Part-of-speech tagging: Assigning a part-of-speech label (e.g., noun, verb, adjective) to each word in a sentence.
   - Dependency parsing: Analyzing the grammatical structure of a sentence and identifying the relationships between words.
   - Sentiment analysis: Classifying text based on its sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral).
   - Named entity recognition: Identifying and categorizing named entities (e.g., people, organizations, locations) in text.

3. Audio annotation techniques:
   - Sound event annotation: Labeling audio data with the time intervals and corresponding sound event classes.
   - Acoustic scene annotation: Labeling audio data with the corresponding acoustic scene class (e.g., park, traffic, office).

Given the nature of the described deep learning pipeline, which deals with soundscape data, it is possible that sound event annotation or acoustic scene annotation techniques were used. However, the context does not provide enough information to confirm this.
