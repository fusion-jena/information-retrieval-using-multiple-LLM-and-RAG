The deep learning model was built using the PyTorch framework. This information can be inferred from the context provided, as the training was done from scratch using GPU (Tesla T4) and CUDA Version-12.0 in Google Colab, and PyTorch is a popular deep learning framework that supports CUDA and can be used in Google Colab. Additionally, the model is based on YOLOv5, which is a PyTorch-based implementation of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection system.
