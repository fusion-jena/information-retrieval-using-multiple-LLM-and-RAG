Based on the information provided, there is no explicit mention of how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, such as through methods like grid search or random search. Hyperparameter tuning is an important step in model training to ensure that the model is performing optimally. This process involves selecting the best set of hyperparameters for the model, such as learning rate, number of layers, and number of units in each layer.

However, the text does provide some information about the model architecture and training process that can give us some insight into how the hyperparameters may have been optimized. The model is a deep learning model that takes spectrograms of audio clips as input images. The spectrograms are generated using the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) with a window size of 1600 samples, hop size of 400 samples, and 240 mel-scale frequency bins. Each spectrogram has a height of 438 pixels and a width of 436 pixels.

The recordings are segmented into clips with a fixed duration of 3 seconds, which is a common length used in audio classification tasks. The standardized recordings are then used to train the model using the initial model and reinforcement model. The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as AUC and mAP for each of the six classes of owls.

Without more information, it is difficult to say for sure how the hyperparameters were optimized. However, it is possible that the authors used a method like grid search or random search to find the best set of hyperparameters for the model. These methods involve systematically searching through a range of possible hyperparameters to find the set that results in the best performance on a validation set.

In summary, while the text does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, it does provide some information about the model architecture and training process that can give us some insight into how the hyperparameters may have been optimized. It is possible that the authors used a method like grid search or random search to find the best set of hyperparameters for the model.
