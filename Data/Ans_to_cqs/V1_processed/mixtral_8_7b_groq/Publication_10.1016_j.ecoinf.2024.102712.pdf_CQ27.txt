Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model, including steps such as model serialization or platform selection. However, the context does provide information about the use of remote sensing data and models for estimating aboveground biomass density in forests.

In the context, several studies have used remote sensing data from various sources, such as WGS 84 data from QuickMapServices in QGIS, Sentinel-2 data, airborne lidar and hyperspectral data, and data from NASA's GEDI lidar mission, to estimate aboveground biomass density in forests. These studies have used different modeling approaches, such as model-assisted frameworks and hierarchical modeling, to estimate biomass density.

For example, Duncanson et al. (2022) developed aboveground biomass density models for NASA's GEDI lidar mission using a combination of field data and remote sensing data. The study used a machine learning approach to develop the models, but there is no information provided about the specific steps taken to deploy the trained model.

Similarly, Feng et al. (2022) estimated annual forest carbon loss over the tropics using remote sensing data and a machine learning model. However, the context does not provide information about the process followed to deploy the trained model.

Therefore, while the context provides information about the use of remote sensing data and models for estimating aboveground biomass density in forests, it does not provide explicit information about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model.
