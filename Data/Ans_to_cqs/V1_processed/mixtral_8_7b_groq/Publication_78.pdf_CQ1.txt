The provided context discusses a deep learning pipeline for classifying coral types (healthy, bleached, or dead) using underwater images taken by drones. However, it does not explicitly mention the method used for collecting raw data in the pipeline.

Based on the context, we can infer that the raw data is collected using underwater drones equipped with cameras. The images captured by the drones are then used as input for the deep learning pipeline.

The context also mentions the use of public datasets in other studies related to coral reef classification. For instance, [8] and [9] use hyper-spectral bottom index imagery and VGG-19 deep convolutional neural network, respectively, for bottom-type classification in coral reef areas. However, the context does not specify whether these public datasets were used in the deep learning pipeline being discussed.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we can conclude that underwater drones equipped with cameras are used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for coral reef classification. However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of surveys, other sensors, or public datasets for collecting raw data.
