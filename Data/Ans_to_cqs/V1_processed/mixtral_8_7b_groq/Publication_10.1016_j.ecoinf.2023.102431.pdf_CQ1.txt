In the context provided, the focus is on the study of wildlife species, particularly rare ones, using non-invasive survey methods. These methods include the use of camera traps, acoustic recorders, non-invasive genetic sampling (such as scat, hair, urine, feathers), and track collection. These methods are used for species detection over large areas, which can be logistically difficult and expensive.

For instance, the study mentioned in the context used Fisher and Marten tracks for their analysis. They collected tracks of these species and then used discriminant analysis for species and sex discrimination. The sample sizes for training, test, and validation groups for this analysis are detailed in Table 1.

However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of surveys or public datasets for collecting raw data. It's likely that in this specific study, these methods were not used. Instead, the focus was on developing non-invasive survey methods like FIT, which can provide more detailed information (like sex identification) beyond just species presence/absence.

So, while the context does not provide a comprehensive answer to the query about the methods utilized for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline, it does mention the use of sensor-based data (camera traps, acoustic recorders) and specific sampling techniques (non-invasive genetic sampling, track collection) for wildlife studies.
