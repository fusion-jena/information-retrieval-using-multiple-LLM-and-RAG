Based on the provided context, there is no information indicating that a deep learning model such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer is used in the pipeline. The methods mentioned in the context are mainly traditional machine learning algorithms and wavelet transformation techniques. These include Random Forest (RF), Successive Projections Algorithm (SPA), Weight Average Partial Least-Squares Regression (WAPLSR), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Continuum Removal (CR), Continuous Wavelet Transformation (CWT), and Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR). Therefore, I cannot confirm the use of any deep learning models in the pipeline.
