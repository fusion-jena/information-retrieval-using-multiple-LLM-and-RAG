Based on the provided context, there is no information indicating that a deep learning model, such as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer, was used in the study. The study does mention the use of a deep learning-based retrieval of forest biomass, but it does not specify the type of deep learning model used.

The study does mention the use of four regression models for forest above-ground biomass (AGB) estimation: AdaBoost, random decision forest (RF), multilayer neural network (NET), and Bayesian ridge regression (Bayes). However, these are not considered deep learning models as they do not have multiple hidden layers.

The study also mentions the use of Lidar and Landsat 8 data for aboveground biomass estimation, but it does not specify the use of a deep learning model for processing or analyzing this data.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the type of deep learning model used in the study.
