The training process for the model described in the given text is designed to stop early if there is no improvement in accuracy after 20 epochs. This is a form of early stopping, which is a common technique used to prevent overfitting and to save computation time. However, the specific criterion used to determine when training is complete is not explicitly stated as being related to validation loss plateauing.

The training process involves using a batch size of 32, the Adam optimizer, and a learning rate that varies based on the cosine function's law. The learning rate is typically in the range between 0.0 and 1.0. The loss function used is the cross-entropy loss function, which is a common choice for classification problems.

The training set is normalized and standardized before being fed into the network. The training set consists of various band combinations for both salinity and vegetation types, as described in Table 5. During cross-validation, samples are split such that each sample's training set may be used to validate the model, with the goal of increasing the statistical dependability of the outcomes.

While the criterion for stopping training is not explicitly stated as being related to validation loss plateauing, it is possible that the early stopping function used in this training process could indirectly achieve a similar effect. Specifically, if the validation loss does not improve for 20 epochs, then the early stopping function would halt the learning process, effectively stopping training when the validation loss has plateaued. However, this is an inference based on the information provided and is not explicitly stated in the text.

In summary, while the specific criterion used to determine when training is complete is not explicitly stated as being related to validation loss plateauing, the early stopping function used in this training process could indirectly achieve a similar effect by halting the learning process if the validation loss does not improve for 20 epochs.
