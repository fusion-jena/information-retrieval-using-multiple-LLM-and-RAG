The deep learning pipeline in the given context employs several optimization techniques, including Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with momentum and the Adam optimizer.

For the initial phase of the deep learning pipeline, where pre-trained models are used as feature extractors, the base models are frozen and loaded with weights trained on the ImageNet dataset. Here, the SGD optimizer with a learning rate of 0.5 and momentum of 0.9 is used. This classic optimization algorithm computes gradients on individual training examples, enabling faster learning and convergence [1]. Moreover, the addition of momentum helps to smooth the training process and avoid getting stuck in poor local minima [2].

In the fine-tuning stage, where the top layers of the pre-trained models are trained along with the classifier layer, a different optimization technique is applied. The MobileNetV3 model is optimized using the Gradient Descent algorithm, while the MobileNetV2 model is compiled and optimized with the Adam optimizer.

The Adam optimizer, a more recent development in optimization techniques, combines the advantages of two popular optimization algorithms: AdaGrad [3] and RMSProp [4]. Adam calculates individual learning rates for different parameters, making it an efficient optimization algorithm for problems with sparse gradients or noisy data [5].

In summary, the deep learning pipeline described in the context utilizes Stochastic Gradient Descent with momentum for feature extraction and both Gradient Descent and Adam optimizers for fine-tuning, depending on the base model used.
