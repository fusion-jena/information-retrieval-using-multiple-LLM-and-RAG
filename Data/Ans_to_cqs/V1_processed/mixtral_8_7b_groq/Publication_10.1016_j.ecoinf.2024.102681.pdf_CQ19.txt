The specific deep learning frameworks used to build the model are not mentioned in the provided text. The text only mentions the use of a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, referred to as CNN-LSTM(C-L), for predicting drought propagation. However, popular deep learning frameworks for building such models include TensorFlow and PyTorch. TensorFlow is a powerful open-source library for numerical computation, particularly well-suited for large-scale Machine Learning. It was developed by the Google Brain team and is used for a variety of applications, including neural networks. PyTorch, on the other hand, is a Machine Learning library for Python, based on Torch, which is an open-source Machine Learning library that was initially developed for use in computer vision and natural language processing applications. While the text does not explicitly mention the use of either TensorFlow or PyTorch, these are two of the most commonly used frameworks for building deep learning models.
