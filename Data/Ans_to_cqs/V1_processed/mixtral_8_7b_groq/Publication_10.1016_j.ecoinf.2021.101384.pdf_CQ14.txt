The provided context does not contain information about the optimization of hyperparameters for a model. The text describes a method for estimating fishing pressure on stocks and other species, but it does not mention any model or hyperparameters that would require optimization.

The algorithm for estimating fishing pressure involves calculating the number of fishing hours in each cell of a study area, and then associating this information with relevant stocks, species, and threatening status classifications. The distribution of fishing pressure is then approximated with a log-normal distribution, and confidence intervals are used to classify stocks as subject to high, medium, or low fishing pressure.

The context also mentions the use of input parameters such as spatial resolution, minimum number of records, and vessel data, but these are not related to hyperparameter optimization. Instead, they are used to ensure the completeness and suitability of the input data for the analysis.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query about the optimization of hyperparameters for a model.
