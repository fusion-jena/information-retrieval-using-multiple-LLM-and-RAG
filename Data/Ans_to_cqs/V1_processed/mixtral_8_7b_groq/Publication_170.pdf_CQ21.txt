Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention that the model performance was evaluated using three metrics: overall error, commission error, and omission error. These metrics are defined by equations (2), (3), and (4) in the text, but the actual calculation process is not provided.

Additionally, there is a reference to a figure showing the error values for models trained using different methods and on different platforms. This suggests that some form of error calculation or comparison was performed as part of the postprocessing.

There is no mention of other common postprocessing steps such as generating saliency maps or creating confusion matrices. Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to give a comprehensive answer to the query.
