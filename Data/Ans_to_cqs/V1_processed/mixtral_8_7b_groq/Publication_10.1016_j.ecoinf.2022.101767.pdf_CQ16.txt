The provided context does not include information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete for machine learning models. Commonly used criteria for determining training completion include validation loss plateau, convergence of model performance metrics, or reaching a pre-determined number of training epochs. These criteria are used to prevent overfitting and ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data. For a more precise answer, additional context or resources related to machine learning model training and evaluation would be required.
