Based on the provided context, the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP) was used in the study by F. Sivrikaya et al. as it demonstrated the best performance in predicting fire ignition points in forests.

MLP is a type of feedforward artificial neural network that consists of at least three layers: an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The learning rate and the optimizer are two common hyperparameters in MLP. The learning rate determines the size of the steps in the gradient descent, while the optimizer is the algorithm used to find the minimum of the loss function.

In the study, the correlation analysis showed that the NDVI (r = 0.51) index was the most reliable predictor of fire occurrence among the ten different variables analyzed. However, the specific values of the learning rate and the optimizer used in the MLP model are not provided.

Therefore, the answer to the query is:


The specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and the optimizer, are not provided in the given context.
