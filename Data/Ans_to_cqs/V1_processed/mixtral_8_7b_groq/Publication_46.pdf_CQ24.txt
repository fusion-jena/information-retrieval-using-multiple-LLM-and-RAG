The provided context discusses the use of deep learning models, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), for species distribution modeling and compares it to a conventional SDM (Species Distribution Model) called BIOCLIM. However, it does not directly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value.

In general, deep learning models like CNNs involve several hyperparameters and processes that can introduce randomness, such as the initialization of weights and biases, dropout regularization, and data shuffling during training. While the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value, it does discuss the hyperparameters involved in convolution operations, such as the size and number of kernels, which can be randomly chosen.

To handle randomness in deep learning pipelines, researchers and practitioners often employ strategies such as setting a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results. This involves initializing the random number generator with a specific seed value so that the same sequence of random numbers is generated across different runs of the model.

In the context of the provided study, the authors could have employed a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility of their results, especially when comparing the performance of the CNN model to the BIOCLIM model. However, the provided context does not mention whether this strategy was used.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it is common practice to use a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results in deep learning models.
