Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete in the fire risk mapping study. However, the study does mention the use of Landsat 8 satellite images and a methodology involving vegetation indices, Jenks natural break classification method, and ArcGIS 10.6. There is also no information suggesting the use of a machine learning model for which training would be required.

In the context of machine learning model training, common criteria for determining when training is complete include:

1. Validation loss plateau: Training stops when the validation loss (a measure of the difference between the predicted and actual values) stops decreasing or shows only minor fluctuations over a certain number of epochs (iterations through the dataset).
2. Early stopping: A technique that stops training when the validation loss starts to increase, preventing overfitting.
3. Training time: Training may be stopped based on a predetermined time limit.
4. Model performance: Training may be stopped if the model achieves a satisfactory level of performance on the validation set.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific details about the criteria used to determine when training is complete in the fire risk mapping study, common criteria for determining training completion in machine learning model training include validation loss plateau, early stopping, training time, and model performance.
