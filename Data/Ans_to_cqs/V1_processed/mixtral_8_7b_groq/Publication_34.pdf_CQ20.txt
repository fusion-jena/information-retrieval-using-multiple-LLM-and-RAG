In summary, the deep learning models in the study were trained using a Windows 10 machine with 2 CPUs, 2.60 GHz and 4 cores each, and a GPU NVIDIA Quadro M1000M. The mxnet package, which was used to fit the SNN, DNN, and CNN models, integrates a high level symbolic language for quickly building customized models and loss functions, and automatically distributes calculations under CPUs or GPUs. However, the text does not provide specific information on how the training time was affected by the use of CPU or GPU resources.
