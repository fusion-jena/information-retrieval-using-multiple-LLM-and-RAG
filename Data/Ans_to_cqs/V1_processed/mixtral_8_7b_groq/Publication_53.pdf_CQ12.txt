The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the context provided, which mentions that a CNN was trained on labeled images to detect dams, and then fine-tuned to improve its performance. Additionally, the model used for initial data verification was a ResNet34 model, which is a type of CNN. Therefore, it can be concluded that a CNN was used as the deep learning model in this pipeline.
