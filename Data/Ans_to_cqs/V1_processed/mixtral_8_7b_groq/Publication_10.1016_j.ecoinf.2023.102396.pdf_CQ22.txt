Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. However, I can provide you with some general metrics that are commonly used to evaluate the performance of machine learning and deep learning models, including those that deal with time series data.

Metrics for model performance evaluation:



1. Accuracy: It is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of input samples. It works well only if there are equal numbers of samples belonging to each class.

2. Precision: It is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives. It is more useful than accuracy when classes are imbalanced.

3. Recall (Sensitivity): It is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the all observations in actual class. It is more important than precision when dealing with imbalanced datasets.

4. F1-score: It is the weighted average of Precision and Recall. It tries to find the balance between precision and recall.

5. Mean Absolute Error (MAE): It measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction.

6. Mean Squared Error (MSE): It is the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values. It is more sensitive to outliers than MAE.

7. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): It is the square root of the mean of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values. It is widely used in regression problems due to its easy interpretability.

8. Coefficient of Determination (RÂ²): It represents the proportion of the variance for a dependent variable that's explained by an independent variable or variables in a regression model.

9. Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): It is a measure of prediction accuracy of a time series forecasting method in statistics. It calculates the average absolute difference between predictions and actual values as a percentage of actual values.

10. Explained Variance Score: It measures the proportion of variance (of y) that has been explained by the model (f(x)). Explained variance is a measure of fit, returning a value between 0.0 and 1.0. A model that always predicts the expected value of y, disregarding the input features, would have an explained variance score of 0.0. A perfect fit would have a explained variance score of 1.0.

For time series data, additional metrics include:

- Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF)
- Stationarity tests (Augmented Dickey-Fuller test, KPSS test)
- Spectral analysis (Periodogram, Fourier Transform)
- Time Series Cross-Validation (TSCV)
- Grid search with cross-validation
- Time series split (training and testing sets)

These are some of the common metrics used to evaluate the performance of machine learning and deep learning models. Depending on the problem and dataset, you may choose to use one or more of these metrics to assess your model's performance.
