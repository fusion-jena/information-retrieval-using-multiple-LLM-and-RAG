The provided context discusses the use of the Faster RCNN + Overlap Sampler technique as an improvement for object detection, but it does not directly mention any data bias mitigation techniques used during preprocessing in the deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide some information about common techniques used to address data bias, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and Diverse data collection.



During the preprocessing stage of a deep learning pipeline, data bias can be addressed using various techniques to ensure a more balanced and representative dataset. Some of these techniques include:

1. Stratified splitting: This method involves dividing the dataset into subgroups or strata based on specific criteria, such as class labels. When splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets, the same proportion of samples from each stratum is maintained in every subset. This ensures that the distribution of classes remains consistent across the datasets, reducing bias.

2. Oversampling: In cases where one class has significantly fewer samples than others, oversampling can be used to balance the dataset. This technique involves creating additional synthetic samples from the minority class, either by duplicating existing samples or using more advanced methods like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). Oversampling helps prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.

3. Undersampling: Alternatively, undersampling can be employed to balance the dataset by reducing the number of samples from the majority class. This technique, however, may result in the loss of valuable information. To mitigate this, a combination of oversampling and undersampling, known as balanced sampling, can be used.

4. Diverse data collection: Collecting a diverse dataset with equal representation from various sources, demographics, or conditions can help minimize data bias. Ensuring that the dataset is representative of the real-world scenarios reduces the likelihood of the model being biased towards specific subgroups.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention these techniques, they are commonly used in preprocessing stages to address data bias in deep learning pipelines.
