Based on the provided context, there are several postprocessing steps that can be inferred after the model training related to metrics calculation. However, there is no explicit mention of saliency maps or confusion matrix.

The study utilized a training-and-test approach with stratification splitting, where the data was split into 100 different training-and-test sets. Hyperparameter tuning was performed on the training set for each set, followed by model training using an optimal setting of the hyperparameter.

The regression models used in the study include AdaBoost, random decision forest (RF), multilayer neural network (NET), and Bayesian ridge regression (Bayes). To evaluate the performance of these models, several metrics were calculated, including root mean squared error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), and accuracy with tolerance (ACT1 and ACT2).

RMSE is a standard way of measuring the error of a model in predicting quantitative data. A lower RMSE indicates a better fit of the model to the data. R2 is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance for a dependent variable that's explained by an independent variable or variables in a regression model. The value of R2 ranges between 0 and 1, where a value closer to 1 indicates a better fit of the model to the data.

Additionally, the study calculated ACT1 and ACT2, which are accuracy measures with tolerance. ACT1 is the accuracy with a tolerance of 15 t/ha ± 10% of AGB, and ACT2 is the accuracy with a tolerance of 10 t/ha ± 5% of AGB. These metrics provide a measure of how well the model predictions match the actual values within a certain tolerance range.

The study also calculated Diff_R2, which is the difference between R2_test and R2_all, and CV_R2, which is cross-validation R2. These metrics provide a measure of how well the model generalizes to new data and how stable the model performance is across different subsets of the data.

In summary, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training in the study include calculating RMSE, R2, ACT1, ACT2, Diff_R2, and CV_R2. There is no explicit mention of saliency maps or confusion matrix.
