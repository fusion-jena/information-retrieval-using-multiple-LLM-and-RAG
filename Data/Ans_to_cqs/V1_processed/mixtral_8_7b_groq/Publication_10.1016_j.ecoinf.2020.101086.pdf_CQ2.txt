The provided context does not directly mention the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of environmental variable data in a different type of analysis.

In the method proposed by Moua et al. (2017), pixels of a study area are represented in an environmental variable space using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), or Factor Analysis of Mixed Data (FAMD). This would likely involve using a CSV or similar format to store the environmental variable data for each pixel.

Additionally, the method uses a Gaussian-like membership function to define the membership degree of a pixel to the neighborhood of another pixel in the factorial space. This requires calculating the Euclidean distance between pixels in this space, which suggests that the data is represented as numerical values.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the deep learning pipeline in this context would likely use numerical data in a CSV or similar format, representing each pixel's environmental variable values. However, the context does not provide enough information to definitively say whether other data formats such as image, audio, or video are used.
