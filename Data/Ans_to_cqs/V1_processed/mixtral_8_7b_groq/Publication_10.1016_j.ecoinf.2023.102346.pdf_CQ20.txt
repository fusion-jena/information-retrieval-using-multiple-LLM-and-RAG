The provided context does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It mentions the use of RStudio and various R packages for testing the prediction power of machine learning algorithms, but it does not specify the hardware used for training. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query based on the given context. However, it is common practice to use Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) for training deep learning models due to their ability to perform parallel processing, which significantly speeds up the training process compared to using Central Processing Units (CPUs) alone. Other hardware accelerators, such as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), are also used for training machine learning models, particularly in large-scale industrial applications. But without further information, it is not possible to determine which specific hardware resources were used in this case.
