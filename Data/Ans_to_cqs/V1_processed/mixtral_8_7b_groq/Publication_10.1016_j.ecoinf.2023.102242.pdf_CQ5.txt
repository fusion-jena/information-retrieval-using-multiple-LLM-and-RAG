Based on the provided context, the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not mentioned. The text focuses on the processing of high-resolution remote sensing data from a 4-band (red, green, blue, and near-infrared) 8-m multi-spectral image obtained from the GF-1 satellite. However, it does not indicate that any of the standard deep learning datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet were used.

The context discusses the challenges in processing high-resolution remote sensing data, including the significance of representative and sufficient training samples for accurate classification models. It also mentions the use of feature optimization tools to filter classification features and secure the optimal feature combination for the classification process. But it does not refer to any specific datasets.

Therefore, without further information, it is not possible to provide the names of the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline described in the context.

The provided context does not mention any of the standard deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it discusses the processing and classification of a 4-band 8-m multi-spectral image from the GF-1 satellite. Therefore, the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline cannot be determined from the context.
