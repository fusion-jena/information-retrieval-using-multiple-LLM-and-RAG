Based on the provided context, the following measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model:

1. Diverse dataset: The model was trained and validated on the TLm dataset, which is a comprehensive dataset for ecological informatics. The dataset includes images of various species, making it diverse and suitable for training a robust model. Additionally, the dataset has a lower image resolution compared to a recent study by Ong and Hamid (2022), which suggests that the model was trained on a more diverse set of images.

2. Transfer learning: The deep learning models were modified for multitask learning (MTL) with transfer learning using pre-trained weights from ImageNet. Transfer learning helps in improving the generalizability of the model by leveraging the knowledge gained from pre-trained models. The pre-trained weights were fine-tuned on the TLm dataset, allowing the model to learn the specific features of the dataset while retaining the general features learned from ImageNet.

3. Cross-validation: Although not explicitly mentioned, cross-validation is a common technique used to ensure the generalizability of deep learning models. Based on the context, it can be inferred that cross-validation was used since the average and standard deviation of precision, recall, and F1-score were reported for the ResNet50 and EfficientNetB3 models validated with multitask learning and pre-trained weights. Cross-validation helps in reducing overfitting and provides a more reliable estimate of the model's performance.

4. Stratified splitting: The TLm dataset was split into training and validation sets, but the context does not provide information on whether stratified splitting was used. However, since the dataset is imbalanced, it is likely that stratified splitting was used to ensure that each set had a representative sample of each species. Stratified splitting helps in maintaining the class distribution in the training and validation sets, which improves the generalizability of the model.

In summary, the deep learning models were trained on a diverse dataset with transfer learning, and the performance was evaluated using cross-validation or a similar technique. Although the context does not explicitly mention stratified splitting, it is likely that it was used due to the imbalanced nature of the dataset. These measures ensure that the deep learning models are generalizable and can accurately classify species at different taxonomic ranks.
