Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the data repository for the deep learning pipeline used for predicting water quality parameters with hyperspectral data. The context includes several studies that have used machine learning and deep learning techniques for water quality prediction, but it does not mention where the data or code for these pipelines is stored. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific repository where the data for the deep learning pipeline is available. It is possible that the data is not publicly available or was not shared in the studies cited.
