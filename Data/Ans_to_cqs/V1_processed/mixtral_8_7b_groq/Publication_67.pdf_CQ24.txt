The provided context discusses the use of deep learning in remote sensing image classification, but it does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, there are some implicit examples of handling randomness.

In the paper "Adding gradient noise improves learning for very deep networks" (Neelakantan et al., 2015), the authors propose adding noise to the gradients during training as a way to improve learning in deep networks. This can be seen as a strategy to handle randomness, as the noise introduces a stochastic element to the gradient descent optimization process.

In the training phase of the pipeline described in the context, two optimization techniques are used: transfer learning and data augmentation. While not explicitly stated, these techniques can also be seen as ways to handle randomness. Transfer learning involves initializing the model with pre-trained weights, which can introduce some randomness as the pre-trained weights are typically the result of training on a different dataset. Data augmentation, on the other hand, involves creating new training examples by applying random transformations (e.g., rotations, translations, flips) to the original images. This introduces randomness as the transformations applied are different for each image.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, there are some implicit examples of such strategies. These include adding noise to the gradients, transfer learning, and data augmentation.
