The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the metrics of precision, recall, and F-measure. These metrics are used to assess the model's ability to accurately recognize fish in video thumbnails.

Precision is the ratio of true positive predictions (correctly identified fish) to the total number of positive predictions (all instances where the model identified a fish). It measures the model's accuracy in identifying fish.

Recall is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of actual positive instances (all fish present in the thumbnails). It measures the model's ability to identify all fish present in the thumbnails.

The F-measure is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and provides a single metric that balances both measures. It is a more robust metric than either precision or recall alone, as it takes into account both the model's accuracy and its ability to identify all fish.

These metrics are used to compare the performance of the deep learning model to other methods, such as the HOG+SVM method. As shown in Table 4, the deep learning model outperforms the HOG+SVM method in terms of F-measure, indicating that it is more effective at recognizing fish in video thumbnails.

The deep learning model's performance is also evaluated using ROC curves, which plot the true positive rate (recall) against the false positive rate (1 - specificity) for different threshold values. As shown in Figure 6, the deep learning model's ROC curves indicate that it is able to accurately distinguish fish from non-fish instances, even when the threshold value is set very high.

Overall, the deep learning model's performance is evaluated using a combination of precision, recall, F-measure, and ROC curves. These metrics provide a comprehensive assessment of the model's ability to accurately recognize fish in video thumbnails.
