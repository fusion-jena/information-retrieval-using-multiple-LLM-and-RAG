The generalizability of the deep learning model was ensured through several measures. Firstly, a diverse dataset was used, which included bioclimatic data and six different traits. This diversity allowed the model to learn from a wide range of inputs and improve its ability to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.

Secondly, cross-validation was employed to evaluate the model's performance. Specifically, a 3-fold cross-validation was used, where the data was split into three parts, and the model was trained and tested on each of these parts in turn. This process was repeated three times, with different parts of the data used for training and testing each time. The resulting mean absolute error (MAE) was then averaged across the three runs to obtain a more robust estimate of the model's performance.

Thirdly, the data splitting was done in a stratified manner. This means that the data was divided into training, validation, and test sets while maintaining the same proportion of each trait in each set. This approach helped to ensure that the model was trained and tested on a representative sample of the data, and prevented any one trait from dominating the training or testing sets.

Fourthly, transfer learning was used to build upon a pre-existing knowledge base. Specifically, pre-trained layer weights from a classification task on a dataset from image-net.org were employed for all CNN models used in the study. This technique allowed the model to leverage the knowledge gained from the classification task and apply it to the regression task at hand.

Finally, to further improve the generalizability of the model, a mixed data approach was used. In this approach, the model was trained on a combination of image and bioclimatic data, allowing it to learn from multiple sources of information and improve its ability to make accurate predictions.

Overall, these measures helped to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model and improve its ability to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.
