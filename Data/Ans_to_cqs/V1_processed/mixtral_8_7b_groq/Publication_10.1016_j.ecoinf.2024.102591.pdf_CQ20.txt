Based on the provided context, the information about the use of specific hardware resources such as GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) or TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) for training a deep learning model is not available. The context focuses on the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE), a cloud-based platform for high-performance computing, particularly in the context of wildfire science. It is mentioned that GEE facilitates access to a vast remote sensing data catalog, including European Space Agency (ESA) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) datasets, and provides the ability to process this data at large spatial scales using automatic parallel processing.

However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of specific hardware resources like GPUs or TPUs for training deep learning models. Instead, it highlights the use of JavaScript, Python, or R application programming interfaces (APIs) and the associated interactive development environment (IDE) in GEE, which still requires a high-level technical expertise.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to accurately answer the query regarding the use of hardware resources such as GPUs or TPUs for training deep learning models in this particular scenario.
