The provided context does not include specific information on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. There is no mention of techniques such as grid search, random search, or any other optimization methods. The text focuses on the comparison of input and output parameters of permafrost models, the limitations of using certain tools with influence diagrams in the GeNIe software program, and the importance of assessing permafrost model performance and representation. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional information.
