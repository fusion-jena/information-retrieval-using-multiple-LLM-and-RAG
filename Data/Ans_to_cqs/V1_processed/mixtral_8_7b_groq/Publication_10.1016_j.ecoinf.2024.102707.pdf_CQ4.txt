Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. Data augmentation is a common technique used in deep learning to increase the amount of training data and improve model performance by applying random transformations to the existing data. These transformations can include flipping, rotating, and scaling images.

However, the context does mention that the researchers tested working with different spatial resolutions of the imagery during the training phase. Specifically, they used the same images at different spatial resolutions during training, but found that this approach was not beneficial. While this is not explicitly referred to as data augmentation, it is a related technique that involves manipulating the existing data to create new training examples.

Additionally, the context mentions that the researchers used the default settings for the YOLOv6 deep learning model, but it does not specify whether any data augmentation techniques were included in these default settings.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot definitively answer the query about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. It is possible that data augmentation techniques were used, but this information is not provided in the context.
