The text provided does not give information about the specific deep learning framework used to build the object detection network for underwater images. It mainly focuses on the architecture and modifications made to the network, such as the use of dilated and depthwise separable convolutions, and the introduction of new modules like CSMB and LKSP.

The backbone of the network is referred to as CSMBDarknet, which is a modified version of CSPDarknet, the backbone used in YOLOv8. However, the text does not specify the deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) in which these networks are implemented. Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer this query accurately.
