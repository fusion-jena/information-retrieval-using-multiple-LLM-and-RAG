The provided context discusses a deep learning pipeline used for herbarium specimens classification and transfer learning. However, it does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques applied within this pipeline. The context does mention that a simple crop and resize data augmentation was used with the default settings of Caffe for a model implemented in the Caffe framework [37]. Beyond this, there is no detailed information about the specific data augmentation techniques employed, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query.
