The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This information can be inferred from the context provided in the "Post-processing and Bounding Box Fusion" section, which mentions the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to build features for the network. Additionally, the "Deep Learning" section mentions the use of a neural network architecture based on GoogLeNet, which is a type of CNN. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
