The provided context discusses various techniques used to improve the feature learning and accuracy of deep learning models, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), in the context of aquatic ecosystem health classification. However, it does not explicitly mention techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing. Nevertheless, I can provide some general techniques used to address data bias in the context of machine learning and deep learning.

1. Stratified splitting: Stratified sampling is a method of sampling that ensures each subset (or 'stratum') of the population has roughly the same percentage of samples as the entire population. Stratified splitting is particularly useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets, where certain classes or categories are over- or under-represented. By using stratified splitting, one can ensure that each subset of the data (e.g., training, validation, or testing) maintains the same class distribution as the original dataset.

2. Oversampling: Oversampling is a technique used to increase the number of instances from the minority class in an imbalanced dataset. This can be done either by replicating instances from the minority class or by generating synthetic instances using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). Oversampling helps the model to learn more about the minority class, reducing bias towards the majority class.

3. Undersampling: Undersampling is a technique used to decrease the number of instances from the majority class in an imbalanced dataset. This can be done either by randomly removing instances from the majority class or by using more sophisticated methods like Tomek's Links or NearMiss. Undersampling helps to balance the dataset, reducing the influence of the majority class on the model's learning process.

4. Diverse data collection: Collecting diverse data is crucial for reducing bias in deep learning models. By gathering data from various sources, distributions, and demographics, one can ensure that the model is exposed to a wide range of patterns and variations, reducing the likelihood of overfitting or biased learning.

While the provided context does not discuss these techniques explicitly, they are essential for addressing data bias during preprocessing in deep learning pipelines.
