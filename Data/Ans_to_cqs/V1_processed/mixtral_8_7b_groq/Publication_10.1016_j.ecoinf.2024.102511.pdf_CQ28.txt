Based on the provided sources, there is no clear information about which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model for bioacoustic classification. The sources mainly focus on the methods and techniques used for bioacoustic classification, rather than the specific platform or infrastructure used for deploying the deep learning models.

Source [2] discusses image data augmentation for deep learning, but it does not mention any specific platform for deployment. Similarly, source [5] discusses the classification of dolphin echolocation clicks using spectral properties, but it does not mention any platform for deploying the deep learning models.

Source [3] introduces ERDDAP, a data server for oceanographic and atmospheric data, but it does not mention any deep learning models or platforms for deployment. Source [4] provides a link to the ERDDAP website, but it does not contain any information about deep learning models or deployment platforms.

Sources [6] and [7] are preprints of upcoming papers in Ecological Informatics, and they discuss the application of neural network classification methods on a novel dataset. However, they do not mention any specific platform for deploying the deep learning models.

Therefore, based on the provided sources, it is not possible to determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model for bioacoustic classification.
