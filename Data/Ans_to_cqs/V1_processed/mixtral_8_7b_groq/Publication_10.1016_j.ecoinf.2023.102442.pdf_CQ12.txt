The specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline described in the given articles is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This information is directly stated in the title and content of the paper "A Sentinel-2 based multispectral convolutional neural network for detecting artisanal small-scale mining in Ghana" by Gallwey et al., 2020. 

The authors utilized a CNN to detect artisanal small-scale mining in Ghana using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The model was trained to identify mining areas by learning patterns in multispectral images, demonstrating the effectiveness of deep learning techniques in large-scale land use and land cover classification tasks.

In summary, the deep learning model used in the described pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
