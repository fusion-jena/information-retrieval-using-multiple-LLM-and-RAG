The context provided does not give specific information about the exact hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that the growing field of deep learning can be attributed to the recent availability of powerful hardware and large amounts of training data. This suggests that the training of the deep learning model for the specific task of detecting and identifying Collembola on microscope slides was likely performed using high-end computational resources such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). These types of hardware are commonly used for training deep learning models due to their ability to perform parallel processing, which significantly speeds up the training process compared to using a Central Processing Unit (CPU) alone.

In summary, while the context does not provide specific details about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, it is mentioned that the use of powerful hardware is a key factor in the growth of deep learning. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that GPUs or TPUs were used for training the model.
