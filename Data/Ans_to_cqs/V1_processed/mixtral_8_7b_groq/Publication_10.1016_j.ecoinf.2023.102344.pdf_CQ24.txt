The provided context discusses various aspects of deep learning models, but it does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of specific training configurations and optimization algorithms that could be used in conjunction with a random seed value to ensure reproducibility.

For instance, the context mentions that the training configuration for the pre-trained models under Approach 3 converged after 1000 epochs with Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (SGDM) as the optimization algorithm. The use of a fixed random seed value in conjunction with this training configuration would ensure that the same set of weights is updated in the same way during each training epoch, leading to reproducible results.

Furthermore, the context mentions the use of pre-trained models, which are typically trained on large datasets and then fine-tuned on a specific task. The use of pre-trained models can help reduce the impact of randomness in the deep learning pipeline by providing a good starting point for training, which can help avoid getting stuck in poor local minima.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does mention the use of specific training configurations and optimization algorithms that could be used in conjunction with a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility. Additionally, the use of pre-trained models can help reduce the impact of randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
