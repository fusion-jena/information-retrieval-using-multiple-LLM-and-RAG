The provided context does not directly discuss the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some studies that use presence-background methods in the context of environmental and geographic data. These methods are typically used for species distribution modeling and involve the use of presence points (data points where a species is known to exist) and background points (data points representing the environment where the species is not present).

For instance, the studies by El-Gabbas and Dormann (2018), Bazzichetto et al. (2023), and Ten Caten and Dallas (2023) all use presence-background methods to analyze environmental and geographic data. While the context does not explicitly mention how the raw data was collected, it is likely that the presence points were obtained through surveys or observations, while the background points were obtained from public datasets or sensors.

In addition, the study by Xu et al. (2024) mentions one of the key choices when using presence-background methods is the selection of appropriate background data. This suggests that the background data is obtained from external sources, such as public datasets or sensors.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that raw data for environmental and geographic analysis using presence-background methods is collected through a combination of surveys or observations for presence points and public datasets or sensors for background points. However, the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline may vary depending on the type of data and the research question being addressed.
