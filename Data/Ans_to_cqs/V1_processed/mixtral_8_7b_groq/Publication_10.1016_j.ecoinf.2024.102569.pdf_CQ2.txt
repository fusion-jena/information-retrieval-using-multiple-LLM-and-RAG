The deep learning pipeline can utilize various data formats, depending on the specific task and the data available. However, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the pipeline. It mainly focuses on the methodology and statistical techniques employed in the analysis of biodiversity data.

The data used in the study are likely in the form of species occurrence data, which can be obtained from various online platforms such as eBird, Pl@ntNet, iNaturalist, and Observation.org, accessible through the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). These platforms provide point observation (PO) data, which may require special attention due to potential issues like species identification errors and local over-aggregation of records.

While the context does not explicitly state the data formats, it does provide information about the types of variables and measurements included in the analysis. These variables can be broadly categorized into:

1. Environmental variables: These include land area, forest area, water area, elevation, standard deviation of elevation, Laplacian, slope, geological category, annual average of radiation, annual amount of sunshine, height of snow, organic carbon, cation exchange capacity, pH of soil, annual mean temperature, mean diurnal range, isothermality, temperature seasonality, maximum temperature of warmest month, minimum temperature of coldest month, temperature annual range, mean temperature of wettest quarter, mean temperature of driest quarter, mean temperature of warmest quarter, and mean temperature of coldest quarter.
2. Precipitation variables: These include annual precipitation, precipitation of wettest month, precipitation of driest month, precipitation seasonality, precipitation of wettest quarter, precipitation of driest quarter, precipitation of warmest quarter, and precipitation of coldest quarter.
3. Evapotranspiration variables: These include actual evapotranspiration amount (AET) and potential evapotranspiration amount (PET).

Based on this information, it can be inferred that the data used in the study are likely in the form of tabular data (CSV or similar), containing the various environmental, precipitation, and evapotranspiration variables for different geographical locations. However, the context does not provide information on the use of image, audio, or video data formats in the deep learning pipeline.
