I'm sorry for any confusion, but the provided context does not include information about a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the TPEBO algorithm for hyperparameter optimization, its application in fine-tuning LSTM models, and its use in forecasting models. However, it does not mention or provide a link to a data repository like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Please consult the original research source or related documentation for this information.
