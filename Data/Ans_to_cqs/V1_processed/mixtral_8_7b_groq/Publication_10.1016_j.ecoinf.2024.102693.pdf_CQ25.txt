The pieces of context provided discuss three different types of deep learning models, namely Transformer-like models, CNN-like models, and MLP-like models, but they do not explicitly mention the specific purpose of these models in terms of classification, segmentation, or detection tasks. However, based on the descriptions given, we can infer that these models are primarily used for feature extraction and processing in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

The CNN-like model, ResNet, is renowned for its robust translational invariance and ability to extract high-level semantic features, which are crucial for image classification tasks. ResNet has exhibited superior performance compared with previous models in various downstream recognition and detection tasks, implying its use in these tasks.

The Transformer-like models, such as ViT and Volo, are initially designed for sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) tasks in NLP, replacing LSTM with a full-attention structure. With the success of transformers in NLP, researchers have begun to explore their application in CV. The core structure of the transformer-like visual model consists of an encoder module with several stacked blocks. Each block comprises a token mixer module for fusing spatial information and an MLP module for fusing channel information. The token mixer module variations among different transformer-like visual models, such as ViT's self-attention module, indicate their potential use in various CV tasks requiring spatial information processing.

The MLP-like model, while not explicitly mentioned in the context, is a type of neural network with multiple layers of nodes, or "neurons," connected by weights. MLPs are typically used for classification tasks, where they learn to map input features to output classes based on the training data.

In summary, while the pieces of context do not explicitly state the purpose of these deep learning models, based on their descriptions, we can infer that they are primarily used for feature extraction and processing in CV and NLP tasks, including classification, segmentation, and detection tasks.
