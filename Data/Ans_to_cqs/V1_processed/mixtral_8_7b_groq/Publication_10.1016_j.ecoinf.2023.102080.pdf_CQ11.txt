The provided context does not include information about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link for it. The context mainly discusses the "covsel" package in R, which seems to be a tool for collinearity filtering and model-specific embedding in ecological data analysis. The package has three functions: "filteralgo," "embed," and "filter," each with specific inputs and arguments. However, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or any data repository link.

Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information as it is not included in the provided context.
