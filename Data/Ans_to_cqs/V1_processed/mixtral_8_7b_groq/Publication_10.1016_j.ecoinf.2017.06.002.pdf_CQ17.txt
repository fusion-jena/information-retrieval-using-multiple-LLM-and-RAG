I'm sorry for any confusion, but the context provided does not include information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context focuses on data management and synthesis in the field of earth system science, including data description, quality checking, processing, and organization. Therefore, I'm unable to provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
