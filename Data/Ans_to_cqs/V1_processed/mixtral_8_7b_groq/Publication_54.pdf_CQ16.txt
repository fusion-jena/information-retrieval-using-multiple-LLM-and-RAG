The context provided does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention some techniques that are commonly used to monitor and assess the performance of a model during training, which can be used to make a determination about when training should be considered complete.

One such technique is the use of a validation set to provide an unbiased evaluation of the model fit on the training set while tuning model hyperparameters. This can help to identify if the model is overfitting to the training data, which is a common concern when training machine learning models. If the model's performance on the validation set stops improving or starts to degrade, even as the model continues to fit the training data better, this can be an indication that training should be stopped.

Another technique mentioned in the context is k-fold cross-validation, which is a resampling technique used to avoid overfitting. This technique involves dividing the training data into k groups, or folds, and then training and evaluating the model k times, each time using a different fold as the validation set. This can help to provide a more robust estimate of the model's performance and can also be used to identify if the model is overfitting.

In addition, the context mentions a mechanism for swapping the training and validation misclassified datasets and retraining the model until it yields the highest accuracy possible on the validation and test datasets. This can be seen as a form of early stopping, where training is stopped when the model's performance on a validation set stops improving or starts to degrade.

Overall, while the context does not provide specific criteria for determining when training is complete, it does mention several techniques that can be used to monitor and assess the performance of a model during training, which can be used to make a determination about when training should be considered complete.
