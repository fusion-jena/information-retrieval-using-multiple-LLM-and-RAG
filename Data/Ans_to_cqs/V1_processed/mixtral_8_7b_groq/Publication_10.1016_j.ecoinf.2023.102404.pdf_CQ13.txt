The provided context discusses the use of a Random Forest (RF) model, which is a type of ensemble learning method, and not a deep learning model. Therefore, the text does not mention any hyperparameters specific to deep learning models such as learning rate or optimizer.

In the RF model, the following hyperparameters were tuned using a grid search approach:

1. numberOfTrees: This represents the number of decision trees in the ensemble. The grid search explored different values to determine the ideal number of trees that balances model complexity and predictive performance.

2. minLeafPopulation: This refers to the minimum number of samples required to form a leaf node in each tree. The optimal setting was found to prevent overfitting while capturing meaningful patterns in the data.

3. bagFraction: This indicates the proportion of the training dataset used to train each individual tree. The best value was searched for to enhance model diversity and generalization.

4. seed: A random number seed was used to ensure reproducibility in the model training process.


The provided context discusses the use of a Random Forest model, not a deep learning model. Therefore, hyperparameters specific to deep learning models such as learning rate or optimizer are not mentioned. Instead, the text focuses on the tuning of RF model hyperparameters, including numberOfTrees, minLeafPopulation, bagFraction, and seed.
