The provided context does not give specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention a dataset D in the context of plant identification studies.

Dataset D is used in a plant identification study, where a biased dataset is created by randomly taking 70% of the data in D for training and 30% for testing. The distribution is approximate and depends on the number of photos per species in dataset D. For example, if a given species X has 20 photos, 14 randomly chosen photos will go to the training dataset and 6 to the testing dataset. However, if the number of photos for species X is 2, one will go to the training dataset and the other one to the testing dataset, resulting in a 50%-50% distribution.

Additionally, the context mentions Caffe, a convolutional architecture for fast feature embedding, but it does not specify the dataset used with it.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the answer is:

 The specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, are not mentioned in the provided context. However, a dataset D is used in a plant identification study, and a biased dataset is created by randomly taking 70% of the data in D for training and 30% for testing.
