The text provided does not give specific details about the postprocessing steps applied after training the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for digitized natural images. However, it does mention some components of the overall process that can give us a general idea.

The authors describe the use of two types of CNNs: one for distinguishing between stained and unstained images, and another for differentiating between clubmoss and spikemoss images. The models include several layers, such as convolution layers, batch normalization layers, ReLU (Ramp) layers, pooling layers, flatten layers, dropout layers, and linear layers. The training process for these models is carried out using Mathematica notebooks, which are provided as supplementary materials.

After training a model, common postprocessing steps in machine learning projects include:

1. Generating predictions on a separate test dataset.
2. Evaluating the performance of the model using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC).
3. Creating visualizations to help interpret the model's performance, such as confusion matrices, saliency maps, or feature importance plots.

Based on the information provided, we can infer that the authors might have carried out some of these steps. Specifically, they might have calculated accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for their models, since they mention using a test dataset in their methodology. However, there is no explicit mention of generating saliency maps or creating confusion matrices.

In summary, while the text does not provide specific details about the postprocessing steps applied after training the CNNs, it is likely that the authors evaluated the models using various metrics and potentially created visualizations to aid interpretation.
