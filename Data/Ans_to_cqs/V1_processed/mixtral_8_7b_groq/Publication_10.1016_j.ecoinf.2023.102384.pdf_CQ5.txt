Based on the provided context, there are several datasets used in deep learning pipelines, but not all of them are specified. Here are the datasets mentioned:

1. Pest24: A large-scale very small object dataset of agricultural pests for multi-target detection. It was introduced in the paper "Pest24: A Large-Scale Very Small Object Data Set of Agricultural Pests for Multi-target Detection" by Wang et al. in 2020.

2. Sticky trap images: These are images of sticky traps used to monitor and detect whiteflies and thrips in agricultural settings. They are used in the paper "Using an Improved YOLOv4 Deep Learning Network for Accurate Detection of Whitefly and Thrips on Sticky Trap Images" by Wang et al. in 2
