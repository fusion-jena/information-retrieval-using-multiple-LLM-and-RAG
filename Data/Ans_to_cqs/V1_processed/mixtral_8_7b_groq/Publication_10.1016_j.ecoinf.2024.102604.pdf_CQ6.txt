The provided context discusses the process of correcting sampling bias in species distribution models, particularly in environmental spaces. However, it does not directly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

In general, data preprocessing is an essential step in machine learning and deep learning, which involves preparing and cleaning the data before training a model. This step includes various techniques such as:

1. Data cleaning: This involves removing or correcting errors, inconsistencies, and missing values in the data.
2. Data normalization: This is the process of scaling the data to a common range or distribution, which can help improve the model's performance and convergence.
3. Data scaling: This involves resizing the data to a specific range or dimension, which can be useful when dealing with high-dimensional data.
4. Data transformation: This involves converting the data into a different format or representation, which can help improve the model's performance and interpretability.

In the context of species distribution modeling, data preprocessing may involve cleaning and transforming the environmental and species occurrence data. For instance, missing or erroneous environmental data may need to be removed or imputed, and the data may need to be transformed to a common scale or distribution. Similarly, species occurrence data may need to be cleaned and filtered to remove duplicate or erroneous records.

Moreover, the provided context discusses two methods for correcting sampling bias in species distribution models: geographic filtering and representativeness-oriented methods. Geographic filtering involves removing or down-weighting presence points that are close to each other in geographic space, while representativeness-oriented methods assign weights to presence points based on the representativeness of the underlying sampling effort. These methods may also require preprocessing steps such as data cleaning, normalization, or scaling, depending on the specific implementation.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, it is clear that data preprocessing is an essential step in species distribution modeling and machine learning in general. The specific preprocessing steps may vary depending on the data and the model, but they typically include data cleaning, normalization, scaling, and transformation.
