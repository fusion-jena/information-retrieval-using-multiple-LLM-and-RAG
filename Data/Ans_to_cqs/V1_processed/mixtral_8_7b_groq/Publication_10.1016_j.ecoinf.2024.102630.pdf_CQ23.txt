The provided context does not contain specific information about the deep learning model or the measures taken to ensure its generalizability. However, it does mention a study by Li et al. published in Ecological Informatics in 2024, which focuses on Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data and its suitability for different research needs.

In the context of analyzing and selecting NDVI data, the authors discuss the importance of considering factors such as spatial resolution, temporal resolution, and data quality. These considerations could potentially be applied to the development of a deep learning model, as ensuring a diverse and high-quality dataset would contribute to the model's ability to generalize well to new, unseen data.

Additionally, the authors mention the use of cloud cover and surface information across NDVI product datasets, which may introduce distinct strengths and weaknesses. This suggests that the authors may have employed techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting to account for variability in the data and ensure the model's robustness.

However, without explicit information from the study, it is not possible to definitively state which measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.

 
While the provided context discusses a study involving NDVI data and potential factors to consider when working with such data, it does not contain specific information about the generalizability measures taken for a deep learning model. Therefore, a precise answer cannot be given based on the available information.
