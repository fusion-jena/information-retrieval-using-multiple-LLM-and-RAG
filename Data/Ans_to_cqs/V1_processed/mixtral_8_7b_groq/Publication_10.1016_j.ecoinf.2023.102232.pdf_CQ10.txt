The text provided does not give a specific link to the deep learning pipeline used in the study. However, it does mention that all the scripts and dataset used in the study are publicly available at <https://github.com/lucaros1190/LS-MCMC-hybridGenAlgo>. This repository contains the code for the MCMC algorithm used in the study, which is a type of Bayesian inference algorithm commonly used in deep learning. It is possible that the deep learning pipeline used in the study is included in this repository, but the text does not provide enough information to confirm this. Therefore, I would recommend checking the repository for the deep learning pipeline code. If it is not included, it may be necessary to contact the authors of the study for more information.
