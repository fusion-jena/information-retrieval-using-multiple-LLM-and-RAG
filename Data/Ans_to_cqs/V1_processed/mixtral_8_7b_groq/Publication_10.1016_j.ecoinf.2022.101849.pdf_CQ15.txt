The deep learning pipeline in the given context uses the Adam optimizer for training the feed-forward neural network. The Adam optimizer is a method for optimization that combines the ideas of two other methods: adaptive gradient algorithm and root mean square propagation. It is an extension of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) that includes adaptive learning rates for each parameter.

The Adam optimizer is known for its efficiency and is widely used in deep learning applications. It is well-suited for problems that involve large datasets and high-dimensional parameters. The Adam optimizer uses the past gradients to adjust the learning rate, which results in faster convergence and better performance compared to other optimization methods.

In contrast, the SGD optimizer is a simple optimization method that updates the parameters in the direction of the negative gradient. It is a batch-based optimization method that updates the parameters after processing each batch of data. The SGD optimizer is computationally efficient, but it may not converge as quickly as other optimization methods.

Therefore, in the given context, the Adam optimizer is used for training the feed-forward neural network, which is a deep learning technique for predicting potential natural vegetation (PNV) based on climatic features. The Adam optimizer is chosen for its efficiency and ability to converge quickly, even in the presence of noisy or scarce labels.
