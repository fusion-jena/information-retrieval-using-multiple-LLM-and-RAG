The provided context discusses the use of Random Forest (RF) models in the classification of seagrass meadows using multispectral images, but it does not mention anything about deep learning or data annotation techniques. Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot provide an answer to the query about data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

However, I can provide some general information about data annotation techniques used in deep learning. Data annotation is the process of labeling data so that it can be used to train machine learning models. In the context of computer vision, data annotation techniques include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing a box around an object of interest in an image. The box defines the object's location and size, and the annotator may also label the object with a class label.
2. Semantic segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image with a class label. This allows for the creation of a pixel-wise mask that defines the object's shape and location.
3. Instance segmentation: This technique is similar to semantic segmentation, but it also distinguishes between individual instances of an object. For example, if there are multiple cars in an image, instance segmentation would label each car with a unique instance ID.
4. Landmark annotation: This technique involves identifying and labeling key points or landmarks on an object. For example, in facial recognition, landmarks might include the eyes, nose, and mouth.

These data annotation techniques are used to create labeled datasets that can be used to train deep learning models for computer vision tasks. The choice of data annotation technique depends on the specific task and the desired output.
