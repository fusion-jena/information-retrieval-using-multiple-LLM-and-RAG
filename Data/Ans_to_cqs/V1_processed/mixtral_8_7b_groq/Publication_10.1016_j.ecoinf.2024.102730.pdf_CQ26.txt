The provided context discusses the use of deep learning in various ecological studies, but it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge of machine learning and data preprocessing, there are several techniques that can be used to address data bias, including stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting is a method of splitting data into training and testing sets that ensures each set has a similar distribution of classes. This can help to ensure that the model is trained and tested on a representative sample of the data, reducing the risk of bias.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to address class imbalance in the data. Class imbalance occurs when one class has significantly more examples than another class. This can lead to bias in the model, as it may become overfit to the majority class. Oversampling involves creating more examples of the minority class, while undersampling involves reducing the number of examples of the majority class. Both techniques can help to balance the class distribution and reduce bias.

Diverse data collection is a technique that involves collecting data from a wide range of sources and ensuring that the data is representative of the population. This can help to reduce bias by ensuring that the model is trained on a diverse range of examples, rather than a narrow subset of the data.

In the context of ecological studies, these techniques could be used to address bias in the data. For example, in a study of plant species identification, oversampling or undersampling could be used to address class imbalance, while diverse data collection could be used to ensure that the model is trained on a wide range of plant species.

It is important to note that while these techniques can help to reduce bias, they are not a guarantee of unbiased models. Other factors, such as the quality of the data and the choice of model architecture, can also contribute to bias. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider all aspects of the deep learning pipeline when building ecological models.
