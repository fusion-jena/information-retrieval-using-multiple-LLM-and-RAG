Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the performance metrics used to evaluate a deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that PermaBN, a Bayesian network model, was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. These metrics are commonly used to evaluate the performance of predictive models, including deep learning models.

Accuracy is the ratio of correct predictions to the total number of predictions. It is a general measure of a model's performance but can be misleading if the classes are imbalanced.

Precision, also known as positive predictive value, is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of positive predictions. It measures the proportion of correct positive predictions out of all positive predictions made by the model.

Recall, also known as sensitivity, is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of actual positive instances. It measures the proportion of correctly identified positive instances out of all actual positive instances.

Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that similar metrics, such as accuracy, precision, and recall, were used to evaluate the deep learning model. However, the specific metrics used are not mentioned in the provided context.
