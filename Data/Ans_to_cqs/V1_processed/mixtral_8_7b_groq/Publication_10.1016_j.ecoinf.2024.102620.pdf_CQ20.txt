The provided context does not contain information about the specific hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. The text focuses on the application of the CASA model for estimating NPP (Net Primary Production) in the Chinese region, using various data sources such as NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), vegetation type data, DEM (Digital Elevation Model), temperature, precipitation, radiation, road data, GDP data, and population data. It mentions that some data, like NDVI, was resampled to a finer resolution. However, there is no mention of hardware resources used for training any deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
