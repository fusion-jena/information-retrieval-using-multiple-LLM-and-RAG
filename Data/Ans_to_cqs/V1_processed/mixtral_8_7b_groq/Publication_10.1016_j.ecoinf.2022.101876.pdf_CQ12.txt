In the pipeline described, a deep learning model called Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) is utilized. Faster R-CNN is a two-stage object detection model that first identifies regions of interest in an image that may contain objects and then classifies these objects into specific categories. This model is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a popular deep learning architecture for analyzing visual data. CNNs are designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from images, which makes them highly effective for computer vision tasks such as image classification and object detection. Therefore, the deep learning model used in the described pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network, specifically, a Faster R-CNN.
