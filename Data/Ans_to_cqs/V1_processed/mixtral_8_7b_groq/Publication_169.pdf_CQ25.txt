The deep learning model in question is designed for the purpose of plant species classification. The model utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) combined with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to accurately classify plant species into one of the 100 categories. The CNN-LSTM model is implemented with the python library, using Theano and Keras, and optimized using the gradient descent Adam algorithm. The model consists of 20 layers, including 12 convolutional layers, five pooling layers, one Fully Connected layer, one LSTM layer, and one output layer with a softmax function for classification. The convolutional layer, activated by the ReLU function, extracts features from the input image, while the max-pooling layer reduces the dimensions of the input image. The LSTM layer is used to extract time features, and the Fully Connected layer sorts the plant species images based on these features to predict their classification. The input size of the LSTM layer is (196,512) after reshaping. The system requirements for implementing this model include an Intel(R)Core i7-4790@ 3.6GHz CPU, Microsoft window 64bit operating system, and 16GB of RAM.
