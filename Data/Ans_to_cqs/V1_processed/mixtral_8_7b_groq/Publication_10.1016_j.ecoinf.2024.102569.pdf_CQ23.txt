Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some implicit indications that suggest the use of certain techniques.

Firstly, the context refers to the use of a dataset that includes both cultivated and wild species, which can be interpreted as an attempt to increase the diversity of the dataset. This is a good practice as it can help the model to learn a wider range of patterns and relationships, improving its ability to generalize to new data.

Secondly, the context mentions the use of the root trimmed mean squared prediction error (RTMSPE) to select the appropriate values for the tuning parameters τ and ϕ. This suggests the use of some form of cross-validation, as the RTMSPE is calculated using a subset of the data to estimate the model's performance on unseen data.

However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of stratified splitting, which is a technique used to ensure that each fold of the data contains a representative sample of the different classes or categories present in the data. This can be important in ensuring that the model is trained and tested on a diverse range of data, which can help to improve its ability to generalize.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit information on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, there are some implicit indications that suggest the use of diverse data and cross-validation. However, the absence of explicit mention of stratified splitting suggests that this technique may not have been used.
