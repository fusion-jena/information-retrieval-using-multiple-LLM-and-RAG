Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about postprocessing steps such as generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, or creating a confusion matrix after the model training phase in the LaDeco system. The context mainly focuses on the overall architecture, loading pre-trained models, setting thresholds, and the output format of LaDeco.

However, it is mentioned that LaDeco calculates the pixel percentage of each landscape element in the image and exports the results in CSV format. This implies that some form of metrics calculation is involved, but it does not specifically mention any additional common postprocessing steps like generating saliency maps or creating a confusion matrix.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention postprocessing steps like saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix creation, it is possible that some form of metrics calculation is being performed as part of the data processing module. Still, there is no clear evidence of other typical postprocessing steps being carried out within the LaDeco system.
