The context does not provide information about the specific dataset used in the deep learning pipeline. The pipeline involves training a model on a training set, validating it on a validation set, and testing it on an independent test set of 2060 images. However, the specific dataset is not named or described in terms of its source or content.

The pipeline includes data augmentation techniques such as horizontal flips, random zooms, and counter-clockwise shears, which suggest that the dataset may contain images. The data is normalized to ImageNet mean values, indicating that the dataset may be similar to ImageNet in some way. However, this is not enough information to determine the specific dataset used.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
