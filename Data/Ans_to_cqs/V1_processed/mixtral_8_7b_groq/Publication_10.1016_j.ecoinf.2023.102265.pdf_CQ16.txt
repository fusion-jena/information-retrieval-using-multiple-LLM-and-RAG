The context provided does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the manual classification algorithm mentioned. However, it does mention that the classifier is a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model trained with 5-fold cross validation. In general, for SVM models, training is often considered complete when the model's performance on a validation set stops improving or when the validation loss plateaus. This means that the model's ability to accurately classify the validation data has reached a maximum, and further training is unlikely to significantly improve its performance.

Additionally, the context states that the classifier was trained on a basic laptop using its CPU, and it does not mention the use of early stopping techniques which are often used in deep learning models to prevent overfitting and to determine when training should be stopped.

It's also worth noting that the context states that the classifier was trained using features extracted from a previous step, but it does not specify how these features were selected or extracted. It is possible that feature selection or extraction methods were used that helped to reduce the dimensionality of the data and improve the classifier's performance, which in turn could have affected the determination of when training was complete.

In summary, while the context does not provide specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the manual classification algorithm, it is likely that the classifier's performance on a validation set was used as a metric to determine when training was complete.
