The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This model, specifically a ResNet50 model, was chosen due to its successful application in spectrogram classification in previous studies. Although other models and ensembles of models have shown optimal performance, a single ResNet50 model was selected for prediction efficiency and reasonable memory requirements. The implementation of the ResNet50 model only includes the feature extraction layers, excluding the remaining layers used for ImageNet classification, referred to as the network "top". The network top consists of fully connected layers for learning a predictive model from the input features. These layers are composed of nodes that take a weighted sum of the input's values and pass it through a transfer function, with learnable weights. In this case, two fully connected layers separated by a drop-out layer were used.
