The provided context discusses the importance of high-quality training data in deep learning models and the use of benchmark datasets to assess the limits of AI systems. However, it does not directly mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.

Regularization methods are techniques used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models, including deep learning models. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, and performs poorly on unseen data. Regularization methods introduce a penalty to the loss function to prevent the model from learning the noise and outliers in the training data.

Two common regularization methods used in deep learning are dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly drops out, or sets to zero, a proportion of the neurons in a layer during training. This prevents the model from relying too heavily on any single neuron or group of neurons, reducing overfitting. Dropout is typically applied to the fully connected layers in a deep learning model.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This encourages the model to have smaller weights, reducing overfitting. L2 regularization is applied to all the weights in the model.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, dropout and L2 regularization are two common regularization methods used in deep learning. Dropout randomly drops out a proportion of the neurons in a layer during training, while L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights.
