Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text focuses on the details of the deep learning models and techniques used for plant species identification, but it does not mention where the data used in the study can be found or accessed. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to this query.
