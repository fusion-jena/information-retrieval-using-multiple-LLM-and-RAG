In the context provided, there is no explicit mention of the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the machine learning models discussed, namely PCR, PLSR, and Random Forest (RF). However, it is common in machine learning to use a validation set or a plateau in the validation loss as a criterion for determining when training should be stopped.

PCR and PLSR are both linear regression models. For these models, training could be stopped when the validation loss starts to increase, indicating that the model is starting to overfit to the training data. This is known as early stopping.

Random Forest, as an ensemble learning method, is less prone to overfitting due to the averaging of the results from many decision trees. However, training could still be stopped based on a validation loss plateau. Additionally, for RF, a grid search was used to find the best number of trees (ntrees) to use in the model. This process could also involve monitoring the validation loss to determine the optimal number of trees.

In the studies referenced, Guanter et al. (2015) use the EnMAP spaceborne imaging spectroscopy mission for earth observation, but they do not provide details on the training of their models. Guimar√£es et al. (2019) evaluate regression analysis and neural networks to predict total suspended solids in water bodies from unmanned aerial vehicle images, but they also do not provide specific details on their stopping criteria for model training.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific criteria for determining when training is complete, it is common in machine learning to use a validation set or a plateau in the validation loss as a criterion for stopping training.
