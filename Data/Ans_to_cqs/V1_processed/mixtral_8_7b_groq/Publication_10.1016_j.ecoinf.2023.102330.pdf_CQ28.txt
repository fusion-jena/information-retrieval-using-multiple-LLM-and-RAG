The provided context does not contain information about the specific platform that was used to deploy the deep learning model. The context discusses the use of automated recording units (ARUs) for collecting acoustic data and the use of custom convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for species detection and identification. However, it does not mention any specific cloud platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform that was used for deploying the deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
