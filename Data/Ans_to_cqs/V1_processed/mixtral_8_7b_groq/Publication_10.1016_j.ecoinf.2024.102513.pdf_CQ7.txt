The data for deep learning model training was split using specific criteria that are common in machine learning projects. These criteria involve dividing the dataset into three subsets: training, testing, and validation sets.

In the context provided, the dataset for each period was divided in a ratio of 70:20:10. This means that 70% of the data was allocated for training the model, 20% for testing the model, and the remaining 10% for validation.

The training set is the primary dataset used to train the deep learning model. It is the data that the model learns from, enabling it to make predictions or classifications. The model's parameters are adjusted based on the performance on this set.

The testing set, also known as the development set, is used to provide an unbiased evaluation of the model during the training process. It helps to assess the model's ability to generalize from the training data to unseen data. The performance on the testing set is monitored to check if the model is overfitting or underfitting the training data.

Lastly, the validation set, also referred to as the hold-out set or the validation dataset, is used to fine-tune the model's parameters and select the best model. It is the data that the model hasn't seen during the training process. The validation set is used after the training process to validate the model's performance.

These criteria ensure that the deep learning model is trained effectively and can make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.
