Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline in the study does not seem to use any of the standard datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it appears to use NAIP (National Agriculture Imagery Program) imagery for classification purposes. The authors use this imagery to classify different features, such as woody vegetation, in the research plots. They also mention the possibility of incorporating other spectral libraries or remote sensing products with more detailed spectral information for refining classifications. However, they caution that the success of machine learning methods, including deep learning, depends on the quality of the inputs, such as imagery and training data.

To validate their methods, the authors assessed the accuracy and reliability of the classification for the 2020 imagery, using ground truth information. They had conducted ground-based surveys in the research plots in 2020, which enabled them to ground-truth the classifications. They generated a stratified random sample of points across all five sites and calculated the kappa statistic to assess the accuracy of the classifications.

Therefore, while the study does not use any of the standard deep learning datasets, it provides valuable insights into the use of NAIP imagery and ground-based surveys for classification purposes. It also highlights the importance of the quality of inputs in the success of machine learning methods.
