The specific dataset used in this deep learning pipeline is a manually annotated dataset focused on Collembola, a group of small arthropods. This dataset was created to train and evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, specifically Yolov5 and Faster R-CNN, in identifying Collembola on microscope slides. The dataset contains 2195 annotations, including 9 species of interest and a category labeled as "Other". 

While the context does not explicitly mention other standard datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, it does mention that both versions of Faster R-CNN were pre-trained on ImageNet, indicating that ImageNet was used as part of the deep learning pipeline. 

It's important to note that the choice of dataset is often dependent on the specific task and context. In this case, the dataset was created to address the challenge of Collembola species identification on microscope slides. The authors found that Yolov5 outperformed Faster R-CNN in identifying Collembola on these microscope slides, demonstrating the importance of selecting a dataset that accurately represents the problem at hand. 

In summary, the datasets used in this deep learning pipeline are a manually annotated Collembola dataset and ImageNet, which was used for pre-training Faster R-CNN.
