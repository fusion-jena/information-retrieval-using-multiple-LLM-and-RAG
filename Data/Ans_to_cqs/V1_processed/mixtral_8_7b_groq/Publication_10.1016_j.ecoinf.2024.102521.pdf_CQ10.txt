I was unable to find a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline in the provided context. The sources mention various studies and systems that use deep learning for insect detection and monitoring, such as STARdbi, the whitefly pest abundance estimation pipeline, and the AI-powered mobile image acquisition system for vineyard insect traps. However, they do not give a direct link to a code repository for these pipelines. It is possible that the code for these pipelines is not publicly available or was not shared in the mentioned sources. If you are interested in a specific pipeline, I would recommend reaching out to the authors of the corresponding study for more information.
