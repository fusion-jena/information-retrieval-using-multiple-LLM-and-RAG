The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of a validation set, which is a subset of the full dataset used for modeling. In this particular context, the full dataset is divided into three parts: a training set, a validation set, and a test set. The training set is used for fitting the models, while the validation set is used to estimate prediction error for model selection and hyperparameter tuning.

The validation set is used to assess the performance of the model at different stages of the training process. This allows for adjustments to be made to the model in order to improve its accuracy. The validation set serves as an unbiased estimate of the model's ability to generalize to new data, which is important for ensuring that the model is not overfitting to the training data.

In addition to the validation set, resampling methods are also used to assess the accuracy of the final model. These methods involve randomly dividing the full dataset into multiple subsets, and then repeatedly training and evaluating the model on different combinations of these subsets. This helps to provide a more robust estimate of the model's performance, as it takes into account the variability of the data.

It's important to note that data availability is often limited, so setting aside a test set cannot always be afforded. In such cases, resampling methods become essential to evaluate the model's performance.

In summary, the strategy for monitoring model performance during training involves the use of a validation set, which is used to estimate prediction error for model selection and hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, resampling methods are used to provide a more robust estimate of the model's performance. These methods allow for adjustments to be made to the model in order to improve its accuracy and prevent overfitting.
