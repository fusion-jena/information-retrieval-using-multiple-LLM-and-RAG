The provided context does not specifically mention the optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. However, it does discuss various machine learning algorithms and techniques used in remote sensing and digital soil mapping.

Machine learning algorithms like Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Random Forests (RF) are used for land cover classification and digital soil mapping. These algorithms require optimization techniques to adjust the model parameters for better performance.

For instance, the backpropagation algorithm is commonly used in ANN for adjusting the weights and biases of the network. It is an optimization technique that minimizes the error between the predicted and actual values by updating the parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient.

In the context of digital soil mapping, Mohammadi and Toomanian (2016) used ANN and artificial neural networks with a database extension for soil mapping. Although they do not explicitly mention the optimization technique, they might have used a variant of the backpropagation algorithm for training the ANN.

Similarly, Congalton and Green (2009) discussed assessing the accuracy of remotely sensed data, which is crucial for any machine learning pipeline. Accuracy assessment involves optimization techniques like cross-validation and bootstrapping for estimating the model performance.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines like SGD or Adam, it does discuss various machine learning algorithms and techniques used in remote sensing and digital soil mapping. These algorithms require optimization techniques for adjusting the model parameters, such as backpropagation in ANN and cross-validation in accuracy assessment.
