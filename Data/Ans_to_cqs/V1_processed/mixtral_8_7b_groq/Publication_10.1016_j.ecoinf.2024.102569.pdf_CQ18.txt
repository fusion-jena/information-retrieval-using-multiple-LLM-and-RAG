In the provided context, there is no explicit description of a strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention the use of Root Trimmed Mean Squared Prediction Error (RTMSPE) for tuning parameters τ and ϕ, which could be used as a form of monitoring the model performance. RTMSPE is a measure of the difference between predicted and actual values, and by calculating it at different stages of training, one could monitor how well the model is learning.

Additionally, the use of a penalized loss function with an L1 penalty could also be seen as a form of monitoring the model performance during training. The L1 penalty, also known as Lasso regularization, helps in preventing overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which is proportional to the absolute value of the coefficients. By gradually increasing the value of the tuning parameter ϕ, one could monitor the impact of this penalty on the model performance and thus ensure that the model is not becoming too complex and is still able to generalize well.

Furthermore, the use of gradient ascent method for computing the L1 penalized estimates, also provides a way of monitoring the model performance. Gradient ascent is an optimization algorithm that iteratively moves in the direction of the gradient of the function to be optimized, in this case the penalized loss function. By tracking the value of the loss function and the coefficients at each iteration, one could monitor how the model is changing and whether it is converging to a good solution.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention a strategy for monitoring the model performance during training, it does mention the use of RTMSPE, L1 penalty and gradient ascent method, which could be used as a form of monitoring the model performance.
