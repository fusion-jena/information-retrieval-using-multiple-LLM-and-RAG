The provided context does not give specific information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. There is no mention of techniques such as grid search, random search, or any other optimization methods. The context focuses on the data splitting procedure, white balance setting, and the validation of the model's performance. It also mentions the use of the YOLOv5 model and "Slicing Aided Hyper Inference" (SAHI), but it does not explain how these methods are related to the optimization of hyperparameters. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to provide an accurate answer to this query.
