The provided context does not contain information about a specific deep learning model and its purpose. However, it does mention two models, Word2Vec and BERT, which are word embedding techniques and transformer-based models, respectively. These models are used for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, but their specific purposes are not provided.

Word2Vec is a widely known word embedding technique that can be carried out in two ways: by creating and training a custom word2vec space or by using pre-trained models. The purpose of Word2Vec is to investigate cultural ecosystem services (CES) from social media data. It can predict the target word based on a nearby word or learn to predict a target word according to its context.

BERT, on the other hand, is a transformer-based model that has been shown as a promising tool for text classification. It is expected to improve NLP algorithms primarily by including textual data from social media or applying transformer-based models.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the purpose of deep learning models in NLP tasks is to improve the accuracy of NLP algorithms and investigate CES from social media data. However, a specific deep learning model and its purpose are not provided.
