The deep learning model employed in LaDeco is a semantic segmentation algorithm, specifically the deeplabv3 Ã¾ resnet269 model. Semantic segmentation is a technology used in image recognition that assigns specific objects or categories to each pixel of an image. This is different from image classification, where an entire image is classified into a single category, or object detection, where individual objects within an image are detected and classified.

In the context of LaDeco, the semantic segmentation model is used to calculate the pixel percentage of each landscape element in the image. The model comprises two main components: a downsampling network that detects objects within an image, and an upsampling network that assigns each pixel to its corresponding object or landscape element. By setting a threshold, users can filter out negligible values and round them to zero, which helps to highlight the dominant landscape elements in the image.

The deep learning model used in LaDeco is particularly well-suited for landscape-based applications, as it has been trained on the ADE20K dataset, which focuses on the recognition of 150 indoor and outdoor objects. The ADE20K dataset is a significant contributor to the field of semantic segmentation and has been developed by the MIT Torralba team.

In summary, the deep learning model used in LaDeco is a semantic segmentation algorithm that assigns specific objects or categories to each pixel of an image. This model is well-suited for landscape-based applications and has been trained on the ADE20K dataset, which focuses on the recognition of 150 indoor and outdoor objects.
