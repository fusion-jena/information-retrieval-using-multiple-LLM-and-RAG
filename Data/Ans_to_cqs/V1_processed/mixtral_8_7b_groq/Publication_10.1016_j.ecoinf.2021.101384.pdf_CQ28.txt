Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information that specifies the particular cloud platform (such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud) used to deploy the deep learning model. The context does mention that Global Fishing Watch (GFW) data is used, and that this data is downloadable for scientific purposes and includes vessel data aggregated at 0.01 resolutions with fishing activity cells classified through a machine learning model. However, it does not give details about the cloud platform used for deploying this model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query with the given context.
