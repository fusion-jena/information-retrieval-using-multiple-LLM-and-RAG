Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that larger R2 values are found when considering L < 500, which could imply that some form of subsampling or scaling is being used. Additionally, the use of a pre-trained DeeplabV3+ model with the COCO dataset suggests that the model may have been trained on a diverse range of images and objects, which could include transformed versions of the original images. Common data augmentation techniques in deep learning include flipping, rotating, and scaling, as well as other transformations such as cropping, brightness and contrast adjustments, and adding noise. It is possible that one or more of these techniques were used during the training of the DeeplabV3+ model on the COCO dataset, but without further information, this cannot be confirmed.
