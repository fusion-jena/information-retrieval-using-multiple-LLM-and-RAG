Based on the provided context, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is specified in the section "2.4. Convolutional neural network setup and training" where it's mentioned that CNNs are particularly suitable for image analysis due to their ability to extract spatial features. Furthermore, the text describes the architecture and training process of the CNN in detail, which includes the use of ReLU activation for convolutional layers, ELU activation on the fully connected layer, ADAM optimizer, and a specific number of iterations and batch size for training. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model used in this pipeline is a CNN.
