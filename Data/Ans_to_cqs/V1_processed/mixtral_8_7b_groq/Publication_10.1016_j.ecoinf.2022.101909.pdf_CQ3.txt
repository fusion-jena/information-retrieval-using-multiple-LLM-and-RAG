The provided context discusses the use of transfer learning and fine-tuning techniques with the ResNet50 deep learning model for bioacoustic tasks, specifically for identifying bird species using color spectrograms of two-second durations. However, it does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

Common data annotation techniques for computer vision tasks include:

1. Image-level annotation: In this method, each image is labeled with a single class or category. This is the simplest form of annotation and is often used for image classification tasks.
2. Bounding box annotation: Here, a bounding box is drawn around the object of interest in an image. This technique is useful for object detection tasks where the goal is to locate and classify objects within an image.
3. Semantic segmentation: This method involves labeling each pixel in an image with a specific class or category. Semantic segmentation provides a more detailed understanding of the image content, as it not only classifies objects but also delineates their boundaries.
4. Instance segmentation: This technique combines object detection and semantic segmentation, where each instance of an object is segmented and classified individually.

For bioacoustic tasks like bird species identification using spectrograms, the following annotation techniques could be used:

1. Image-level annotation: Each spectrogram could be labeled with the corresponding bird species.
2. Bounding box annotation: Rectangular bounding boxes could be drawn around the spectrogram regions corresponding to the bird calls.
3. Segmentation: The spectrogram could be segmented to separate the bird call from background noise.

However, the provided context does not mention which of these techniques were used in the deep learning pipeline for bird species identification. It only mentions that the implemented CNN corresponded to a modified version of ResNet50 and that RGB images of 224×224×3 (color spectrograms) were used as inputs.
