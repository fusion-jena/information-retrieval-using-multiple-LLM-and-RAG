Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific preprocessing steps (such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning) applied directly to the training data before training a deep learning model for mining detection. However, there is some information about a preprocessing step applied to the data after the model has been trained and used for initial classification.

In the context "A Sentinel-2 based multispectral convolutional neural network for detecting artisanal small-scale mining in Ghana" (Elmes et al., 2020), a post-processing step is mentioned to remove the influence of isolated, small, misclassified pixels. This step is applied to the initial classification results and not directly to the training data. The minimum size of a mine is set to 3 pixels (or > 2700 m2 in a Landsat Image) to remove the influence of small, misclassified pixels on the reclassification of water bodies.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to provide specific details about the preprocessing steps applied directly to the training data before training a deep learning model. However, it is common practice in deep learning to apply preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning to the training data. Normalization and scaling are used to adjust the range of input features to improve model convergence and performance. Cleaning is used to remove noise, outliers, or irrelevant data from the training set. These steps help improve the model's accuracy and generalization.


Although the provided context does not contain specific details about the preprocessing steps applied directly to the training data before training a deep learning model, it is common practice in deep learning to apply preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning to the training data. These steps help improve model convergence, performance, and generalization.
