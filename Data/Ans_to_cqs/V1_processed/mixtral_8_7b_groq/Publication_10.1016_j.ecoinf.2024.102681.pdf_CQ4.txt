Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling in the described deep learning pipeline. The focus of the provided studies is primarily on the development and application of deep learning models for drought assessment, prediction, and analysis of drought propagation characteristics.

In the study by Kaur and Sood (2020), they developed a deep learning-based drought assessment and prediction framework using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). However, they do not discuss any data augmentation techniques. Similarly, in the study by Khorram and Jehbez (2023), they proposed a hybrid CNN-LSTM approach for monthly reservoir inflow forecasting, but there is no information on data augmentation techniques.

In the context, there is an emphasis on the architecture of the CNN-LSTM (C-L) hybrid model, which includes convolutional layers, LSTM layers, and fully connected layers. The authors mention adjusting the size and number of convolution kernels and hyperparameters like learning rate, but no data augmentation techniques are mentioned.

However, data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in deep learning pipelines, particularly in computer vision tasks, to increase the size of the training dataset and improve model performance by generating transformed versions of the original images. These techniques can also be applied to time series data by creating transformed versions of the original time series, such as shifting, scaling, or adding noise.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention specific data augmentation techniques in the deep learning pipeline, these techniques are widely used in deep learning applications and can be beneficial in improving model performance.
