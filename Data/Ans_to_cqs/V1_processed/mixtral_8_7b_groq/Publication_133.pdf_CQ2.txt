Deep learning models in insect ecoinformatics, as described in the provided context, primarily use image data. This is evident in the studies and projects referenced, which focus on using deep learning for analyzing and classifying insect images. For instance, the study "Deep Learning for Insect Ecoinformatics" uses trap images for insect detection and classification. Similarly, the paper "Detection and Classification of Insects on Stick-Traps in a Tomato Crop Using Faster R-CNN" also utilizes images of insects on stick-traps.

Moreover, the data availability statement for the study "Deep Learning for Insect Ecoinformatics" indicates that the trap images are available online, further confirming the use of image data in this deep learning pipeline. Additionally, the review paper "Insights and approaches using deep learning to classify wildlife" discusses various deep learning models and techniques for image classification in the context of wildlife, which can be applied to insects as well.

While image data is the primary format used in the deep learning pipelines mentioned in the context, other data formats such as CSV or text files might also be used but are not explicitly mentioned. These could include metadata about the images, such as capture time, location, or environmental conditions, which could be stored in CSV or text files and used to supplement the image data in the deep learning process. However, the main focus of the provided context is on the use of image data for insect detection and classification in deep learning pipelines.
