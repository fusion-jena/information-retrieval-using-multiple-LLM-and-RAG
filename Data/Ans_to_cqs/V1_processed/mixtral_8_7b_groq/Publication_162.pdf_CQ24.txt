The provided context does not contain direct information about strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does discuss some techniques used in deep learning for fauna and flora classification that could indirectly relate to handling randomness.

In the context, Dimitri Korsch and Paul Bodesheim are researchers working on fauna and flora classification using deep learning at Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Germany. They are involved in unsupervised machine learning, reinforcement learning, and fine-grained visual categorization, which may include methods for handling randomness.

The paper by M. Simon, E. Rodner, and J. Denzler (2014) discusses a method for part detector discovery in deep convolutional neural networks. This method could potentially involve strategies for handling randomness during the training process.

The iNaturalist Species Classification and Detection Dataset (Horn et al., 2018) is mentioned as a resource for training deep learning models for fauna and flora classification. This dataset could be used to train models with techniques that handle randomness.

The paper by Radig et al. (2021) describes a deep learning classifier for moth recognition using ResNet-50 and ImageNet. They used additional images from internet image search engines to augment the training dataset. To handle the noise from these noisy annotated images, they proposed filtering different types of label noise. This filtering process could involve strategies for handling randomness in the annotations.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value, it does discuss techniques for fauna and flora classification that could potentially involve methods for handling randomness. These techniques include part detector discovery in deep convolutional neural networks, training on large and diverse datasets like iNaturalist, and handling noisy annotations in augmented training datasets.
