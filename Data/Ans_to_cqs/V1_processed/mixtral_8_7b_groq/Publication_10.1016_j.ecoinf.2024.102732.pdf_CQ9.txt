Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The article does mention using data from Landsat-9 and field data in temperate forests of the Himalayan region, as well as using SRTM DEM data from the USGS Earth Explorer website. However, it does not specify where the data and code for the machine learning pipeline are stored or made available for reuse. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query. It would be best to contact the authors of the article or check their affiliated institutions' repositories for more information.
