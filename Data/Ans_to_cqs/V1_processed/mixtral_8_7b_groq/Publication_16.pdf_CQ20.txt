The deep learning model is trained using a GPU, specifically an Nvidia 2070 super GPU with 8GB of memory. This is facilitated by the use of CUDA 11 and cuDNN 7.6.5, which enable GPU-accelerated learning. The use of a GPU for training the model can significantly speed up the process compared to using a CPU alone. This is because GPUs are designed to handle parallel computations, which are well-suited for the matrix and vector operations that are common in deep learning algorithms. Therefore, the use of an Nvidia 2070 super GPU with CUDA and cuDNN can help to reduce the training time of the deep learning model, making it more efficient.
