The provided context does not give information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The text focuses on the comparison of ResNet models, feature extraction, and classification algorithm results. It mentions the use of an SVM model with 5-fold cross-validation but does not specify how the data was split for training and validation in this context. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer based on the given information.
