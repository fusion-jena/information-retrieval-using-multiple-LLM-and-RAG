The pieces of context provided do not explicitly mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, they do mention the use of data augmentation, ground truth validation, and the comparison of the model's performance with two trained models using data from 22 fishing sets.

From this information, we can infer that the following metrics might have been used to evaluate the model's performance:

1. Accuracy: This is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of input samples. It is a common metric used to evaluate the performance of classification models.
2. Precision: This is the ratio of the number of true positives (correctly predicted positive samples) to the total number of positive predictions. It measures the model's ability to avoid false positives.
3. Recall: This is the ratio of the number of true positives to the total number of actual positive samples. It measures the model's ability to identify all positive samples.
4. Data augmentation: This technique is used to increase the size of the training dataset by creating modified versions of the existing samples. It helps to improve the model's ability to generalize and can be used to evaluate the model's performance on a larger dataset.
5. Ground truth validation: This is the process of comparing the model's predictions with the actual values to evaluate the model's accuracy. It is an essential step in the development and evaluation of any machine learning model.
6. Comparison with other models: Comparing the model's performance with other trained models can provide insights into the relative strengths and weaknesses of different models and architectures.

Therefore, while the specific metrics used to evaluate the model's performance are not mentioned in the provided context, we can infer that accuracy, precision, recall, data augmentation, ground truth validation, and comparison with other models might have been used to evaluate the deep learning model's performance.
