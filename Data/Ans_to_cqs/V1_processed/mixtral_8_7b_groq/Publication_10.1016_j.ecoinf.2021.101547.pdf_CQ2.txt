The deep learning pipeline can utilize various data formats, including image, audio, video, and CSV files, depending on the specific task and model. However, the provided context focuses mainly on the use of image data in a deep learning pipeline with ResNet-50.

In the described scenario, the deep learning pipeline processes three-band (RGB) input images with a size of 224 Ã— 224 pixels. These images are organized in a training set, which is used to teach the network how to classify the input data. The training set is divided into small 'mini-batches' of images, typically with a size of 64 images. This approach allows the model to learn from a variety of images at each iteration, while also managing computational complexity.

The images in the training set are labeled according to the user-defined classes, and the network estimates the probability that an image represents each of the different classes during the classification process. The network then computes a 'loss' score for each image based on the difference between the estimated class probability scores and the actual scores.

Although the context primarily discusses image data, deep learning models can also work with other data formats. For instance, audio data can be processed using models like WaveNet or VGGish, while video data can be handled by models like C3D or Two-Stream CNN. Additionally, structured data, such as CSV files, can be processed using models like MLP or DNN for tasks like regression or classification.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline can handle various data formats, including image, audio, video, and CSV files. The provided context focuses on the use of image data in a ResNet-50 model, but other models can be employed for different data formats depending on the specific task and requirements.
