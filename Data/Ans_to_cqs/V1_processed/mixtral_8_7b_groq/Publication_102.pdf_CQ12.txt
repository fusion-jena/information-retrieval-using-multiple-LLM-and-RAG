The deep learning models employed in the pipeline are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Specifically, feed-forward regression networks, CCNN and ResNeXt models, UNet architecture, and VGG16 are used. The feed-forward regression networks, CCNN and ResNeXt models, and VGG16 are all types of CNNs that are used for compressing and encoding images into smaller representation vectors. The UNet architecture is also a CNN model, which is based on an encoder-decoder network and is used for capturing context information from the image. The Model-K architecture is a regression model based on VGG16 without the feature extractor on top, and it is also a type of CNN. The Count-ception network, which is used for comparison, also uses a fully convolutional architecture, which is a type of CNN. Therefore, the pipeline primarily uses CNNs for image processing and object counting.
