The provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does describe the use of ensemble models in the context of species distribution modeling for orchids in New Guinea.

Ensemble models combine the predictions of multiple base models to produce a final prediction. This approach can help reduce the impact of randomness and variability in the predictions of any individual model. In the study described in the context, the ensemble models incorporate Random Forest and Support Vector Machine components, which are trained on 80% of the data for each orchid group. The remaining 20% of the data is used for testing the models.

While the context does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value, it is possible that such a technique was employed during the training of the base models. Using a fixed random seed value can help ensure that the randomization used in the training process, such as the initialization of weights in a neural network, is reproducible and consistent across different runs of the model.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does describe the use of ensemble models, which can help reduce the impact of randomness and variability in the predictions of individual models. It is also possible that techniques such as using a fixed random seed value were employed during the training of the base models.
