The provided context does not include information about data augmentation techniques typically applied in deep learning pipelines, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Instead, it focuses on the importance of considering color blindness when creating maps and visualizations, and introduces an R function that simplifies the process of applying color blind friendly palettes.

To answer the query, I would refer to standard data augmentation techniques used in deep learning, particularly in computer vision tasks. These techniques are used to increase the diversity of training data and improve the robustness of models. Some common data augmentation techniques include:

1. Flipping: Horizontal or vertical flipping of images, which can help the model generalize better and be more invariant to the orientation of objects in the image.
2. Rotating: Rotating images by a certain angle, which can help the model handle objects at different angles and orientations.
3. Scaling: Changing the scale or size of images, which can help the model handle objects at different distances and scales.
4. Cropping: Randomly cropping sections of images, which can help the model focus on important parts of objects and be more robust to occlusions.
5. Color jittering: Randomly changing the brightness, contrast, saturation, or hue of images, which can help the model handle variations in lighting and color conditions.

These techniques can be applied to the training data during the deep learning pipeline to improve the model's performance and prevent overfitting. It is important to note that the specific data augmentation techniques and parameters used may vary depending on the specific task and dataset.
