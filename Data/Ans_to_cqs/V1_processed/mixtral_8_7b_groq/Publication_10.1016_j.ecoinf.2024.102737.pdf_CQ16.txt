The criteria used to determine when training is complete is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that different loss functions, such as contrastive loss, were explored for better performance. This suggests that the choice of loss function might be a factor in determining training completion. In addition, the context discusses the use of training and test sets for each experiment, which implies that the evaluation of the model's performance on the test set could be another criterion for training completion. Typically, training is considered complete when the performance on a validation set stops improving or plateaus, even if the training loss is still decreasing. However, without specific information in the context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
