The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a specific cloud platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform for deploying the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the cyber system where the CNN training application runs is a workstation with specific hardware and software configurations. The workstation runs Windows 10 Pro, and it has an AMD Threadripper Pro 3955WX processor with 32 GB RAM and a GPU NVIDIA Quadro P620. Therefore, it can be inferred that the deep learning model was deployed on a local workstation instead of a cloud platform.
