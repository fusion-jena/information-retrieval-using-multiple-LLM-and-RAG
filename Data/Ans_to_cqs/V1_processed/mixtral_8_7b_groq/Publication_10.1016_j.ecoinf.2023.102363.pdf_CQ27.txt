The process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model involved model serialization and platform selection. First, the model was trained and fine-tuned using the EfficientNet B0 network, which had been previously trained for generic image classification. The feature extraction layers of the model were frozen, and only the weights of the final dense classification layers were updated during training. The model was trained within the Google Colaboratory 'Colab' platform, using the Tesla K80 GPU accessed through cloud computing. An Adam optimizer was used to control gradient descent during training.

Once the training was complete, the model was serialized, which involved saving the model's architecture and weights to a file. This allowed the model to be easily loaded and deployed on other platforms. The serialized model can be used as a tool by other researchers for marine bioacoustic research.

The selection of the platform for deployment would depend on various factors such as the required computational resources, the need for real-time processing, and the available infrastructure. For instance, if real-time processing is required, a local server or an edge computing device could be used for deployment. On the other hand, if computational resources are not a constraint, the model could be deployed on a cloud-based platform such as Google Cloud Platform or Amazon Web Services.

It is important to note that the performance of the deployed model would depend on the computational resources available during deployment. Therefore, it is recommended to use resources that are sufficient to handle the computational requirements of the model. Additionally, the model should be tested and validated on the deployment platform to ensure that it performs as expected.
