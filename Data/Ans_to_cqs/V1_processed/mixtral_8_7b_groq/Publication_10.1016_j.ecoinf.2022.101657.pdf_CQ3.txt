The provided context discusses two main data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for processing camera trap data: bounding box annotation and instance segmentation.

Bounding box annotation is the process of drawing a rectangle around the object of interest in an image. This technique is used in the deep learning architecture mentioned in the context, where the network outputs a belief (a value between 0 and 1) that a particular species has been identified. The mAP metric, used to evaluate the model's performance, takes the mean over all considered species of their respective, species-specific average precision. The subscript 50 in mAP50 refers to the requirement that the area of the intersection of the ground truth bounding box and the predicted bounding box needs to be at least 50% of the area of the union of both for an otherwise true species identification to be considered correct.

Instance segmentation, on the other hand, is a more advanced annotation technique that involves not only drawing a bounding box around the object but also segmenting each instance of the object in the image. This technique is used in the study by Schindler and Steinhage (2021), where they combine Mask R-CNN with Flow-Guided Feature Aggregation to optimize instance segmentation of animal species in video clips.

Additionally, the context also mentions the use of a tool called Zilong, which identifies empty images in camera-trap data, and an Image filtering and labelling assistant (IFLA) that expedites the analysis of data obtained from camera traps. While the specific annotation techniques used in these tools are not mentioned, it can be inferred that they also use some form of data annotation to function effectively.

In summary, the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for processing camera trap data include bounding box annotation and instance segmentation. These techniques help improve the accuracy of species identification and reduce the amount of useless data collected.
