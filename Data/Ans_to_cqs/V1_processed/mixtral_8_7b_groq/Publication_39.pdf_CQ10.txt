The provided context does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It contains details about a specific deep learning architecture called SlowFast, which is used for action recognition in videos. The architecture involves two pathways, a Slow pathway that works on a low frame rate for detecting spatial semantics, and a Fast pathway that uses a high frame rate to capture motion and temporal aspects of the video. The pathways are implemented using ResNets, and lateral connections are used to combine the features from both pathways. The architecture is trained for 40 epochs using Stochastic Gradient Descent with a decreasing learning rate.

 However, the context does not provide any information about the code repository or implementation details of this pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to the GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository for this deep learning pipeline.
