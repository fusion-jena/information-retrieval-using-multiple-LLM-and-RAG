The provided context discusses methods for addressing data bias in map evaluation, particularly in the context of limited data availability and the use of resampling methods. However, it does not directly address the query about techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline.

In the context of deep learning, data bias can arise from various sources such as unrepresentative sampling, class imbalance, or insufficient data diversity. To address these issues, several techniques can be employed during the preprocessing stage:

1. Stratified sampling: This technique involves dividing the population into homogeneous subgroups (strata) based on certain characteristics, and then selecting a sample from each stratum. This ensures that each stratum is proportionally represented in the sample, reducing bias due to unequal representation.

2. Oversampling: In cases where one class is underrepresented, oversampling can be used to increase the number of instances from that class. This can be done by randomly duplicating instances from the minority class or by using techniques like Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) that generate synthetic instances.

3. Undersampling: Conversely, if one class is overrepresented, undersampling can be used to reduce the number of instances from the majority class. This can be done randomly or by using techniques like NearMiss that select instances based on their proximity to the minority class.

4. Diverse data collection: To ensure that the data is representative of the entire feature space, it is important to collect data from a diverse range of sources and contexts. This can help reduce bias due to insufficient data diversity and improve the generalizability of the model.

It is important to note that while these techniques can help reduce data bias during preprocessing, they do not guarantee complete elimination of bias. Careful consideration should be given to the specific sources of bias in the data and the appropriate techniques to address them. Additionally, it is important to continue monitoring for bias throughout the modeling process, including during model training, validation, and testing.
