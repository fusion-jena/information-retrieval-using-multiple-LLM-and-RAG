In the context provided, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for sound classification, include data augmentation and the creation of mel-spectrogram images.

First, data augmentation is performed on the sound database to generate a more robust training set. This involves creating 10 additional audios for each of the 865 audio samples in the database through transformations such as rotations and size modifications. These transformations are applied to the audios, and are then reflected in the mel-spectrogram images.

Next, the augmented audios are converted into mel-spectrogram images, which are then used as input for the CNN. The mel-spectrogram images are created by taking the Fourier transform of the audio signal, and then applying a mel-filterbank to the power spectrum. This results in a 2D image, where the x-axis represents time, and the y-axis represents frequency on a mel-scale.

It is worth noting that no explicit mention is made of other common preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it can be inferred that the data augmentation process and the creation of mel-spectrogram images serve as a form of normalization and scaling, as they generate a standardized set of images with similar properties. As for cleaning, it is assumed that the original sound database was curated and free of errors, as the text does not mention any steps taken to clean or preprocess the data.

In summary, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model for sound classification in the provided context include data augmentation and the creation of mel-spectrogram images. These steps serve as a form of normalization and scaling, while it is assumed that the original data was clean and did not require further preprocessing.
