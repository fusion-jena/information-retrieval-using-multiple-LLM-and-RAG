The deep learning pipeline in the given context utilizes the Adam optimization technique during the training of the YOLOv5s object detection model and the Faster R-CNN model.

For the YOLOv5s model, the network was trained for 300 epochs using an Adam optimizer with a batch size of 16. Similarly, in the Faster R-CNN training process, the Adam optimizer was used to train the model for 3000 iterations.

Although the context does not explicitly mention the use of other optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), it is possible that other parts of the deep learning pipeline employ different optimization algorithms. However, based on the provided context, the Adam optimizer is the only optimization technique explicitly mentioned.
