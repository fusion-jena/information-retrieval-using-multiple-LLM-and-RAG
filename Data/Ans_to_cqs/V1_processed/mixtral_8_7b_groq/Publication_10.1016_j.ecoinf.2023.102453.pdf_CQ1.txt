The primary method for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines for ecological studies, as described in the provided context, is through the use of camera traps. Camera traps are sensors that capture images or videos of wildlife in their natural habitats. These devices can be deployed in large numbers across different geographical locations, enabling the collection of extensive data sets for deep learning model training.

For instance, the studies "How many images do I need?" by Shahinfar et al. (2020), "DeepWILD: wildlife identification, localisation and estimation on camera trap videos using deep learning" by Simoes et al. (2023), and "Classification efficiency of pre-trained deep CNN models on camera trap images" by Stancic et al. (2022) all utilize camera trap data for their deep learning pipelines.

In addition to camera traps, other methods for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines can include surveys and public datasets. Surveys can be used to collect data in a structured manner, allowing researchers to gather specific information relevant to their study. Public datasets, on the other hand, can provide access to large and diverse data sets that can be used for training deep learning models. However, these methods are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context in relation to ecological studies using deep learning techniques.

In summary, the primary method for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines for ecological studies is through the use of camera traps. Other methods, such as surveys and public datasets, can also be used but are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
