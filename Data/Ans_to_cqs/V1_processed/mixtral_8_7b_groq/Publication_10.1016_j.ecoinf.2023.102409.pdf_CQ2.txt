Deep learning pipelines can handle various data formats, including image, audio, video, and CSV files, depending on the specific task and model architecture.

For image-based tasks, deep learning models typically process image data in their original format, which is usually a multi-dimensional array or a tensor. For instance, Unet and Deeplabv3+ models, which are commonly used for image segmentation, process 512 Ã— 512 pixels images as input. These models utilize convolutional layers to extract features from images and generate corresponding output masks.

For audio-based tasks, deep learning models often process audio data in the form of spectrograms or Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs). Spectrograms are two-dimensional time-frequency representations of audio signals, while MFCCs are a representation of the short-term power spectrum of a sound. These representations are then fed into deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs), for tasks like speech recognition or emotion detection.

Video-based tasks typically involve processing sequences of images or frames. Deep learning models for video processing, such as 3D CNNs or CNN-LSTM architectures, handle video data by processing each frame as an individual image and incorporating temporal information using recurrent connections or 3D convolutions.

CSV files, which contain tabular data, are also used in deep learning pipelines for tasks like regression, classification, or time-series forecasting. Deep learning models, such as fully connected neural networks (FCNNs) or RNNs, process CSV data by converting each row into a vector and feeding these vectors into the model.

In summary, deep learning pipelines can handle various data formats, including image, audio, video, and CSV files. The specific data format used depends on the task and the deep learning model architecture.
