Deep learning models can handle various data formats, including image, audio, video, and structured data formats like CSV.

Images are commonly used in deep learning applications, such as object detection, image segmentation, and image classification. For instance, Chollet (2017) presented the Xception model for computer vision tasks, while Durve et al. (2022) used YOLOv5 for automatic droplet tracking in microfluidic applications. In the context of fisheries, Palmer (2021) and Qin et al. (2022) employed deep learning models for fish length and catch number monitoring and fish detection in fuzzy underwater images, respectively.

Deep learning models can also process audio data for tasks like speech recognition, speaker identification, and sound event detection. However, there are no examples in the provided context that deal with audio data.

Video data, which can be considered a sequence of images, is used in deep learning for applications like action recognition, object tracking, and video summarization. In the context of fish monitoring, Coro and Walsh (2021) developed an intelligent underwater video device for fish size monitoring.

Structured data formats, like CSV, are used in deep learning for tasks involving tabular data, such as regression, classification, and time-series forecasting. In the context of fisheries, da Cunha et al. (2023) studied the selection of fish resources for consumption and sale by artisanal fishers.

Moreover, deep learning models can be used for natural language processing tasks, where text data is typically represented in a structured format, such as word embeddings or token sequences. However, the provided context does not include any examples related to text data.

In summary, deep learning models can handle various data formats, including images, audio, video, and structured data formats like CSV. The provided context primarily focuses on image data and structured data formats, with a few examples involving video data.
