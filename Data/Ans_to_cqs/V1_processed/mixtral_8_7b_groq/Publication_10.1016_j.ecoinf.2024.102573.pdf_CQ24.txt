The provided context discusses various aspects of deep learning, particularly in the context of bird species classification, but it does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it is possible to infer some relevant information based on the broader context of deep learning.

Deep learning models often involve randomness during various stages, such as weight initialization, data shuffling, and dropout regularization. A fixed random seed value ensures reproducibility of the training process by making these random events deterministic. Although the context does not explicitly mention this, it is a common practice in deep learning to set a fixed random seed value for ensuring consistent results across multiple runs.

In the context of bird species classification, the Gawlikowski et al. (2023) survey discusses uncertainty in deep neural networks, which can be related to randomness in the training process. They mention that deep learning models can be sensitive to small changes in input data, which can be linked to randomness during data shuffling or weight initialization. However, they do not explicitly discuss strategies to handle such randomness.

In another study, Ha et al. (2021) propose adaptive wavelet distillation from neural networks through interpretations. While their work does not directly address randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it highlights the importance of understanding and interpreting the model's behavior, which can be helpful in diagnosing issues related to randomness.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it is a common practice to use a fixed random seed value for ensuring reproducibility. Additionally, understanding and interpreting the model's behavior can help diagnose issues related to randomness.
