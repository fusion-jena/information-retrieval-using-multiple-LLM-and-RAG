The deep learning models in the study were trained using both personal computer and high-performance computing resources, which included Graphics Processing Units (GPUs).

For semantic segmentation of vegetation mapping, a personal computer with Ubuntu 18.04 operating system was used. This computer was equipped with a 28-core Intel i9-7940× CPU, 125 GB RAM, and two NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080Ti graphics cards.

On the other hand, the open-source DEtection TRansformer (DETR) for object detection was trained on the high-performance computing resources of the Consortium des Equipements de Calcul Intensif (CÉCI) using the Dragon 2 cluster hosted at the University of Mons, Belgium. The specific cluster node used for the training consisted of an Intel Skylake 12-cores Xeon 6126 processor with a frequency of 2.6 GHz, a Nvidia Tesla V100 GPU with 5120 CUDA cores, 16GB HBM2, and 7.5 TFlops double precision.

Therefore, both NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080Ti graphics cards and Nvidia Tesla V100 GPU were used for training the deep learning models in this study.
