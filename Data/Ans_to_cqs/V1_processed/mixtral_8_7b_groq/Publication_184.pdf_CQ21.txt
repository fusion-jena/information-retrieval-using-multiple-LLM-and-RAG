Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after training the model. However, it can be inferred that metrics calculation is one of the postprocessing steps as the text mentions the reduction of average loss to 0.54% and the improvement of precision, recall, and mean average precision during the training process.

Moreover, the creation of a confusion matrix could also be a postprocessing step, as it is a common method to evaluate the performance of machine learning models, especially for classification tasks. A confusion matrix provides a summary of prediction results on a classification problem and can be used to calculate various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

However, there is no mention of saliency maps or any other visualization techniques in the provided context. Saliency maps are often used to visualize the regions of an input that are most important for a model's prediction. While it is not explicitly stated, it is possible that saliency maps were not used in this study.

In summary, based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after training the model likely include metrics calculation and possibly the creation of a confusion matrix. However, there is no explicit information about the use of saliency maps or any other visualization techniques.
