The specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline for oil palm yield prediction are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the data is likely in a structured format such as CSV or a similar format, since machine learning and deep learning algorithms typically require numerical data to train models.

The context does mention that "comprehensive datasets" are used in the research, and that these datasets include information about climate patterns, soil quality, fertilizer use, and seed varieties. These factors suggest that the data is likely to be collected from various sources, such as weather stations, soil analysis reports, and farm management systems, and then processed and structured into a suitable format for machine learning and deep learning algorithms.

Additionally, the context mentions that hyper-parameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV with cross-validation, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning and deep learning to optimize model performance. This further supports the inference that the data is in a structured format, as this technique requires numerical data to perform optimization.

Overall, while the specific data formats are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, it can be inferred that the data is likely in a structured format such as CSV, and that it includes information about various factors that affect oil palm yield, such as climate patterns, soil quality, fertilizer use, and seed varieties.
