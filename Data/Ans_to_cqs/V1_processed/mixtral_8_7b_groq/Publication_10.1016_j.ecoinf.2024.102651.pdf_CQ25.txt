The deep learning model in question is designed for the purpose of classification. This model is built upon a network known as CA-Hybrid, which is a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) modules. The CA-Hybrid network is specifically constructed for the precise categorization of Cervidae, which are localized by YOLOv7.

The CNN component of the CA-Hybrid network is particularly effective at extracting local information, while ViT excels at extracting features from a spatial perspective. The integration of the Class Activation Mapping (CAM) into the residual structure of the CNN enhances the network's ability to focus on critical features, thereby improving its generalization ability.

The CAM mechanism allows the network to assign varying weights to each channel, enabling it to focus on important features. This enhancement improves the feature representation capability of the network, making it more effective at learning image features.

The model's classification performance was evaluated for both small objects (pixels less than 32*32) and medium objects (pixels between 32*32 and 96*96). The results showed that the medium objects achieved higher classification accuracy compared to small objects under identical network conditions.

Furthermore, the monitoring pipeline of this model was compared with object detection networks, demonstrating its effectiveness in resolving background issues. The CA-Hybrid network, with its residual structure and CAM integration, provides a robust solution for the classification of Cervidae, making it a valuable tool in this specific application.
