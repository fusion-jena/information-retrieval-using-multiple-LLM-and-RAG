The provided context does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning models mentioned in the studies. The articles focus on the methodologies, techniques, and applications of the models in various fields such as rice disease identification, chlorophyll content estimation, vegetation extraction, crop type mapping, and biomass estimation.

However, it is common practice to use powerful computational resources like Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) for training deep learning models due to their high computational requirements. These hardware resources can significantly speed up the training process and enable the handling of large datasets.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the hardware resources used for training the deep learning models, it is likely that GPUs or TPUs were used given the complexity of the models and the general practices in deep learning research.
