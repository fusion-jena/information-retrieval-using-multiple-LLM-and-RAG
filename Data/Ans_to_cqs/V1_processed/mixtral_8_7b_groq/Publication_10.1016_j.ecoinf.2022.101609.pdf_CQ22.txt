The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model for predicting pollutant levels are mean squared error (MSE) and root mean squared error (RMSE). These metrics are commonly used for regression problems, which is the type of problem present in predicting pollutant levels. The model was trained to make day-ahead predictions of three pollutants, and the evaluation metric had to be selected appropriately. Other metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall are typically used for classification problems.

The training and validation losses of the model were plotted against the number of epochs, and it was observed that there was a gradual decrease in both losses as the training epochs increased. This indicates that the model was learning. Further training beyond 20,000 epochs would have either resulted in overfitting or no further drop in both losses.

Additionally, the model's predictions were compared with the actual readings of the NO2 pollutant, and it was found that the model's predictions were not too far off the actual readings.

In summary, the deep learning model's performance for predicting pollutant levels was evaluated using MSE and RMSE, which are appropriate metrics for regression problems. The training and validation losses of the model were plotted against the number of epochs, and the model's predictions were compared with the actual readings of the NO2 pollutant.
