The deep learning model for insect detection was trained using a workstation equipped with a specific set of hardware resources. The workstation consisted of an Intel(R) Xeon(R) Silver 4214 CPU with a processing speed of 2.4GHz and a memory capacity of 32 GB. Additionally, the workstation was equipped with a powerful NVIDIA Quadro RTX 5000 GPU, which had a memory capacity of 16 GB and supported CUDA Version 11.4.

The choice of hardware resources was motivated by the need to handle the computational demands of training a deep learning model while ensuring training efficiency. Specifically, the use of a GPU was essential for accelerating the training process, given the large size of the dataset and the complexity of the model. The GPU's memory capacity also played a crucial role in determining the batch size used during training, which was set to 16 tiles at a time.

It is worth noting that the training procedure of the detection model ran for 150 epochs, and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) was used as the model's optimizer with a momentum of 0.9. The default data augmentation techniques of YOLOv5 were also applied during training to improve the model's robustness.

In summary, the deep learning model for insect detection was trained using a powerful workstation equipped with an Intel Xeon Silver 4214 CPU, a large memory capacity of 32 GB, and a high-performance NVIDIA Quadro RTX 5000 GPU with a memory capacity of 16 GB and CUDA Version 11.4. These hardware resources were essential in handling the computational demands of training the model while ensuring training efficiency.
