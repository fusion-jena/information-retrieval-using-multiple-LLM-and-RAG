The provided context does not give information about which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses several models used for ecological informatics, such as ResNet-50, Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST), and HuBERT, but it does not mention where these models were deployed. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
