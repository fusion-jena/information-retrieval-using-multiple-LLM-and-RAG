I'm sorry, but the provided context does not include information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and machine learning algorithms for water quality parameter estimation, as well as model performance assessment techniques. However, it does not mention any data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Data augmentation techniques are often used to increase the amount of training data and improve the robustness of deep learning models. Common data augmentation techniques include horizontal flipping, vertical flipping, rotating, scaling, and translating images. These techniques can help improve the performance of deep learning models by increasing the variability of the training data and reducing overfitting.
