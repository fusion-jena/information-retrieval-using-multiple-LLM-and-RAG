The provided context does not give specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for analyzing the Brazilian Amazon forest. However, it can be inferred that high-resolution images are used as input data in the deep learning model.

One of the papers referenced in the context, "U-net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation" by Ronneberger et al., uses biomedical images for semantic segmentation, which is a similar approach to the one used in the analysis of the Brazilian Amazon forest. In this paper, the authors used a dataset of microscopy images for training their deep learning model.

In the context of analyzing the Brazilian Amazon forest, it can be assumed that remote sensing techniques are used to collect high-resolution images of the forest. Remote sensing is the acquisition of information about the Earth's surface using sensors that are not in direct contact with the surface. These sensors can be carried by satellites, aircraft, or drones.

The context mentions the use of GeoEye image extents, which suggests that high-resolution satellite imagery is used in the analysis. GeoEye is a company that provides high-resolution satellite imagery, and its images have a ground resolution of 0.41 meters.

Therefore, it can be concluded that high-resolution satellite imagery is used as raw data in the deep learning pipeline for analyzing the Brazilian Amazon forest. However, the context does not provide information on whether surveys or public datasets are also used as sources of raw data.
