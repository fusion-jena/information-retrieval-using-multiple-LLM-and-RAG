The provided context discusses a study on transfer learning for automatically identifying empty camera trap images using deep convolutional neural networks. However, it does not explicitly mention any strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value.

However, there are some implicit indications of how randomness might be handled in this specific study. For instance, the authors mention that they "randomly extracted capture events" and "randomly selected events" to create training, validation, and test sets. This implies that some form of randomization was employed during the data preparation phase. However, the specific method for implementing this randomization, such as setting a random seed value, is not provided.

Furthermore, the authors mention that they employed the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer with a momentum value of Î¼ = 0.9 to train the model. The SGD optimizer is a stochastic optimization method that introduces randomness during the training process by sampling a mini-batch of data at each iteration. This randomness helps the model escape local minima and explore the weight space more effectively. However, the context does not mention whether a fixed random seed value was used for the SGD optimizer.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention any strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does imply that some form of randomization was used during the data preparation phase and the training process. However, the specific methods for implementing this randomization, such as setting a random seed value, are not provided.
