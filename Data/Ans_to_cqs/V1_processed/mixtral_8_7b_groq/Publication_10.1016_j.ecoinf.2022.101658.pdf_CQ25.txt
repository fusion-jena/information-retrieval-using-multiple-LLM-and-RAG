The deep learning model in this study is used for semantic segmentation.

Semantic segmentation is a pixel-wise classification task, where the goal is to assign a class label to each pixel in an image. In this specific study, the deep learning model is trained to identify and classify different fuel types in forested areas. This is crucial for understanding wildfire behavior and creating more accurate fire spread models.

The model is built using a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), which is a type of neural network particularly well-suited for image analysis tasks. The DCNN takes as input the ground photographs collected from the Pelican Mountain (PM) and Calling Lake (CL) field sites. These images are manually classified into up to two dominant tree species or other fuel types, forming the basis for the semantic segmentation training and testing.

The model's performance in semantic segmentation is challenged by the high class-imbalance and the limited number of available images. To address this, the researchers employed data augmentation strategies, including horizontal flipping, Gaussian noise addition, and contrast reduction. These strategies increased the training set size fourfold, helping the model to generalize better and improve its segmentation performance.

The augmented training dataset and the manually classified images from PM and CL are used to train the DCNN model. Once trained, the model's performance is evaluated using independent validation data from the Conklin (CK) field site. This ensures that the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data is thoroughly assessed.

In summary, the deep learning model in this study is designed for semantic segmentation, specifically to classify different fuel types in forested areas. Data augmentation techniques are used to improve the model's performance and ability to generalize, ensuring more accurate and reliable segmentation results.
