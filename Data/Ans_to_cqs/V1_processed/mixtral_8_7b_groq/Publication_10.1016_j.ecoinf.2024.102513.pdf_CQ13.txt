The provided context discusses the use of a deep learning model for land use and land cover (LULC) classification, but it does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in the model such as the learning rate or optimizer. However, it can be inferred that the model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the mention of using a CNN for LULC classification.

CNNs typically have several hyperparameters that can be adjusted during training, including:

* Learning rate: This determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function.
* Optimizer: This is a method used to update the weights and biases in the network based on the gradient of the loss function. Common optimizers include stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop.
* Number of layers and number of neurons per layer: These determine the complexity of the model.
* Type of pooling: This includes methods such as max pooling, average pooling, and sum pooling.
* Activation function: This is a non-linear function applied to the output of each neuron, such as a rectified linear unit (ReLU) or sigmoid function.
* Regularization techniques: These are used to prevent overfitting, such as L1 and L2 regularization.

It is common practice to tune these hyperparameters using techniques such as grid search or random search to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters for a given problem.

Therefore, while the specific hyperparameters used in the model are not provided in the context, it can be inferred that the model is a CNN and that it likely has several adjustable hyperparameters such as learning rate, optimizer, number of layers, type of pooling, activation function, and regularization techniques.
