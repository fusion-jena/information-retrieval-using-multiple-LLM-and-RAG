The text provided gives information about several measures that were taken to ensure the performance and generalizability of different models, including a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model. However, it does not explicitly mention the use of diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting for the DNN model.

Regarding the DNN model, the text mentions that a batch normalization layer was added after hidden layer 2, which helped increase the testing accuracy of the model. Batch normalization is a technique that can help reduce overfitting and improve generalization by normalizing the inputs of each batch. Additionally, the hyperparameters of the DNN model, including the learning rate, number of epochs, and batch size, were tuned to optimize the testing accuracy and kappa. Hyperparameter tuning is an essential step in model development that can help improve the model's performance and generalizability.

The text also mentions that the quantity of training data derived from ground data collection was limited. To address this issue, a U-Net model was implemented using the arcgis.learn module of the ArcGIS API for Python, which removed the requirement for a large dataset and used a pretrained ResNet-50 backbone. Pretraining a network on a large dataset can help improve the model's performance and generalizability, especially when the available training data is limited.

In summary, while the text does not explicitly mention the use of diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting for the DNN model, it does describe several measures that were taken to ensure the model's performance and generalizability. These measures include batch normalization, hyperparameter tuning, and pretraining a network on a large dataset. However, without more information, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer to the query.
