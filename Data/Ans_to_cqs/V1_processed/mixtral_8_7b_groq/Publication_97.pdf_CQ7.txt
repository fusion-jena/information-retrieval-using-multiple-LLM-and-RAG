The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, as described in the given context, involves dividing the satellite images into two groups for training and validation. Specifically, satellite images for sites #1, #3, #5, #7-10 were used for training, while sites #2, #4, #6 were used for validation. 

In addition, the training data was generated as batches of size (m, 256, 256, 3), where m is the batch size (m = 20 in their experiments). These batches consisted of sub-images of size 256 Ã— 256 that were randomly cropped out from the original satellite images. The sub-images were almost never repeated and were combined into batches for the neural network training. 

Furthermore, the network training assessment was performed on sub-images generated from image #2, while images #4 and #6 were used for visualization and demonstration of the algorithm's efficacy. 

Therefore, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in this context involved dividing the satellite images into two groups for training and validation, and generating batches of sub-images for the neural network training.
