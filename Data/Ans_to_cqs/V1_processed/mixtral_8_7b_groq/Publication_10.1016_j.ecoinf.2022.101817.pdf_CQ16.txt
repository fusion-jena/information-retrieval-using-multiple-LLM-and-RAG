The criteria used to determine when training is complete for the environmental condition model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that Model 4 has the best performance based on accuracy, and its validation performance is shown in a confusion matrix. This implies that the training process for this model involved monitoring its performance on a validation set, and stopping the training when a desired level of performance was achieved.

In general, one common criterion used to determine when training is complete is when the validation loss plateaus or starts to increase, indicating that the model is starting to overfit to the training data. This is because as the model continues to train, it becomes better at fitting the training data, but may start to perform worse on new, unseen data. Monitoring the validation loss helps to ensure that the model is not overfitting and is still able to generalize well to new data.

Another criterion that could be used is based on the performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, F1 score, etc. If the performance of the model on the validation set stops improving or even starts to degrade, then the training process can be stopped.

In this case, Model 4 has the highest accuracy, recall, and F1 score, and the second highest precision and specificity among the five models compared. Therefore, it can be inferred that the training of Model 4 was stopped based on its performance on the validation set.

It's also worth noting that the provided context only shows the validation performance of Model 4, and not the training performance. Therefore, it's not possible to determine if the training process was stopped based on the training loss or other training-related criteria.
