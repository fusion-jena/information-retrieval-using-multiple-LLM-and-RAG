I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the use of a VGG16-based CNN model for classifying environmental conditions in terrestrial images, as well as the performance of this model under various conditions. However, it does not mention where the code for this pipeline might be found. I recommend checking the paper or additional materials associated with the research for more information.
