Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the optimization of hyperparameters such as grid search or random search being used in the model. The text focuses on the process of clustering freshness data into classes for seven fish species using six organoleptic parameters. 

The clustering method used here is not specified, and it's possible that the number of clusters was determined using the elbow method, as mentioned in the context. However, the optimization of any clustering algorithm's hyperparameters is not discussed.

The clustering algorithm solely considers Euclidean distance as a metric, given the uniform data range. While the text acknowledges the potential influence of different distance metrics on class determination, it does not discuss any systematic approach to optimizing these hyperparameters.

In summary, based on the given context, there is no information suggesting that grid search, random search, or any other hyperparameter optimization techniques were used in this research.
