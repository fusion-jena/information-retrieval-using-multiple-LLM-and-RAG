Based on the provided article information, it can be inferred that the following measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model:

Firstly, the researchers used a diverse dataset to train the deep learning model. They focused on the cloudy coastal zone and utilized the Google Earth Engine platform to handle the massive amount of data required by the pixel-based method. This ensured that the model was exposed to a wide variety of spectral signatures, which is crucial for the model's ability to accurately classify paddy rice and other land cover types.

Secondly, the researchers used a method called Phenology-based Pixel-wise Completion (Ppf-CM) to generate a complete time-series of Landsat images. This method eased the problems caused by the scarcity of entire scene cloud-free Landsat scenes. By using Ppf-CM, the deep learning model had access to more comprehensive and accurate phenological information, which improved its ability to distinguish between different land cover types in different growth stages.

Thirdly, the researchers used a deep learning classifier, which optimized the use of the phenological information yielded from Ppf-CM. The deep learning classifier, a Stacked Auto-Encoder (SAE), has a deep network structure and strong self-learning ability. This allowed the classifier to easily capture and exploit more complex information compared to traditional machine learning methods, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM). The use of a more sophisticated classifier contributed to the model's generalizability.

Lastly, although not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, it can be inferred that the researchers used cross-validation to assess the model's performance. This technique involves dividing the dataset into training and validation sets, training the model on the training set, and then evaluating the model's performance on the validation set. By repeating this process with different divisions of the dataset, the researchers could assess the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

In conclusion, the researchers ensured the generalizability of the deep learning model by using a diverse dataset, Ppf-CM, a deep learning classifier, and possibly cross-validation.
