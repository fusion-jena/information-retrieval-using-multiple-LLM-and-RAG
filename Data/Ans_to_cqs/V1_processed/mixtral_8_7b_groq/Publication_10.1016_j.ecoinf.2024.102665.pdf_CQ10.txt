The provided context does not include information about a deep learning pipeline or any code repository link related to it. The text focuses on the use of the MWST-learned network for clustering and summarizing information on a coral reef community. It mentions the use of statistical tools and methods, such as arc force and Kullback-Leibler divergence, but there is no reference to a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information.
