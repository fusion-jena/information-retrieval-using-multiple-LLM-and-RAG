The provided context does not give specific information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, it does discuss the use of machine learning methods for image classification and the importance of quality inputs for successful classification.

In the context, the authors mention that machine learning methods have great potential for automatic or supervised classification, but their success is dependent on the quality of their inputs, which includes both imagery and training data. They also mention that using NAIP (National Agriculture Imagery Program) and massive training datasets can result in good performance, but historical imagery with its variable characteristics (e.g. blurriness, distortion) may not be as successful.

The authors also discuss the options for richer analysis within their manual classification method and demonstrate how a finer classification may be possible for individual sites or images. They mention that this finer classification was used for quantitative comparisons and for sites where a more detailed classification is possible.

In the absence of specific information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it can be inferred that the authors followed standard practices for data splitting, such as using a portion of the data for training, a portion for validation, and a portion for testing. The specific criteria, such as the ratio of data used for each set, would depend on the specific dataset and the goals of the analysis.

In summary, the provided context does not give specific information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does discuss the importance of quality inputs for successful machine learning classification and the options for richer analysis within a manual classification method.
