The provided context does not give specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for the vegetation biomass density prediction. However, it does mention the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and a hybrid model combining wavelet analysis and the NARX ANN algorithm for enhancing the performance of the NARX ANN model.

In general, optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad are commonly used in deep learning pipelines for optimizing the weights and biases of the neural network. These optimization algorithms aim to minimize the loss function by iteratively adjusting the parameters of the model.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a simple optimization algorithm that updates the parameters in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function. However, it can be slow and may not always converge to the optimal solution.

Adam, which stands for Adaptive Moment Estimation, is a more advanced optimization algorithm that combines the ideas of momentum and adaptive learning rates. It estimates the first and second moments of the gradients to adapt the learning rate for each parameter.

RMSprop and Adagrad are other optimization algorithms that adapt the learning rate for each parameter based on the historical gradient information. RMSprop uses a moving average of the squared gradients to scale the learning rate, while Adagrad uses the sum of the squared gradients.

Therefore, it is possible that one or more of these optimization techniques were used in the deep learning pipeline for the vegetation biomass density prediction, but the provided context does not give enough information to make a definitive conclusion.
