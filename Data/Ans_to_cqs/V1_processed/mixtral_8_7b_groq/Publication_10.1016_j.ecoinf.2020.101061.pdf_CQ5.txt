The specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the network was retrained using hand-annotated data for 40 epochs, and data augmentation techniques such as random flips and translations were tested. It is also mentioned that the unsupervised classifications were normalized by subtracting the ImageNet mean from each channel, which suggests that ImageNet may have been used as a pretraining dataset.

Additionally, the context discusses the use of NEON sites for collecting training data for RGB tree models. The NEON (National Ecological Observatory Network) program provides high-resolution (0.1 m) data that can be used for pretraining deep learning networks. However, it is not explicitly stated that the NEON data was used as a dataset in the deep learning pipeline.

It is also mentioned that there has been a shift in computer vision towards approaches that learn features from data using neural networks, and that there have been few attempts to use learned features in tree detection due to the need for large amounts of labeled training data. This suggests that the authors may have used a custom dataset for training their deep learning model for tree detection.

Overall, while the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, it can be inferred that hand-annotated data, ImageNet, and potentially NEON data were used in the pipeline. However, it is possible that the authors used a custom dataset for training their deep learning model for tree detection.
