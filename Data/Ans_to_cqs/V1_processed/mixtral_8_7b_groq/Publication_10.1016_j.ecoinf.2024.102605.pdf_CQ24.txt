In summary, randomness is employed in machine learning and remote sensing pipelines to improve model performance, prevent overfitting, and ensure representative training data. Strategies include random initialization, random sampling, regularization techniques, random selection of training samples, and data augmentation. These strategies may also be applicable in deep learning pipelines.
