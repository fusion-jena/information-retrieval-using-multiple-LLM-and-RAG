Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context focuses on the data analysis of videos containing wild birds, including the classification of thumbnail characteristics into six categories.

However, we can infer that some form of annotation was performed on the videos since the study analyzed the species richness, ranging from 1 to 106 wild bird species in the videos. To determine the number of species in a video, an ornithologist or an automated system would need to annotate the birds in the video, at least at the species level.

The context also mentions that R software and several packages, including Boruta, lmerTest, car, MuMIn, and randomForest, were used for data analysis. While these packages can be used for machine learning and statistical analysis, they do not provide specific information about data annotation techniques.

In summary, while the context does not directly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that some form of annotation was performed on the videos to determine the species richness. The specific techniques, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, are not provided in the context.
