Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, it is mentioned that the model required no further user input and no post-processing steps. It is also stated that the analysis was seen as more objective, comparable, and robust across time steps.

The context does mention that the model was tested for correlation, which suggests that some form of metrics calculation was performed. However, it does not specify whether this was done as a postprocessing step after model training or as part of the model validation process.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query.


 The provided context does not contain information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. It is mentioned that the model required no further user input and no post-processing steps, but it is not clear if any metrics calculation was performed as part of the model validation process or as a separate postprocessing step.
