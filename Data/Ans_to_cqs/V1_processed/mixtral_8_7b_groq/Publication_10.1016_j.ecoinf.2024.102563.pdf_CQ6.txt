The provided pieces of context do not specifically mention the preprocessing steps for deep learning models. However, they do discuss preprocessing techniques for other types of models and remote sensing data.

In the context of digital soil mapping using artificial neural networks (Mohammadi & Toomanian, 2016), the authors mention that the input data (soil properties) were normalized to a range between 0 and 1. Data normalization is a common preprocessing step for neural networks and other machine learning algorithms to ensure that all features have similar scales and ranges, preventing any single feature from dominating the learning process.

In another study, Lu et al. (2010) used QuickBird imagery for land cover classification. They mention that they performed atmospheric correction and geometric correction on the images before classification. Atmospheric correction is a common preprocessing step for remote sensing data to minimize the effects of atmospheric conditions on image quality. Geometric correction, on the other hand, is used to align the image with real-world coordinates and remove distortions caused by image acquisition.

Clausi (2002) discusses co-occurrence texture statistics, which are calculated based on grey-level quantization. This process involves converting continuous data (e.g., image intensities) into discrete categories (grey levels) to facilitate the calculation of texture statistics. Although not explicitly mentioned as a preprocessing step for deep learning models, grey-level quantization can be useful for reducing the dimensionality of input data and extracting relevant features.

Congalton & Green (2009) provide a comprehensive overview of remote sensing data accuracy assessment. While not directly related to deep learning model preprocessing, their work highlights the importance of data quality control and validation in remote sensing and geospatial analysis.

In summary, while the provided context does not specifically mention preprocessing steps for deep learning models, it does discuss several techniques relevant to machine learning and remote sensing data preprocessing. These techniques include data normalization, atmospheric correction, geometric correction, grey-level quantization, and data validation. These methods can be adapted and applied as preprocessing steps for deep learning models depending on the specific application and data type.
