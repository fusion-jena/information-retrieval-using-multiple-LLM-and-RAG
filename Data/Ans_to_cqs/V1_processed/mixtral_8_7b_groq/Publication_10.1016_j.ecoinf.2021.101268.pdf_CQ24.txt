The provided context does not directly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does discuss the use of various deep learning models for plant species classification in the Peruvian Amazon Forestry Dataset. These models include AlexNet, VGG-19, ResNet-101, and DenseNet-201.

In the context of training these models, randomness can be introduced through various factors, such as the initial weights of the neural network, the order in which training samples are presented, and data augmentation techniques. While the provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies to handle randomness, it does report the accuracy of these models under both raw and pre-processed conditions. This suggests that the authors may have employed techniques such as using a fixed random seed value to ensure consistent initial weights and/or using a consistent order of training samples.

Additionally, the authors report the use of cross-validation, where the dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets. This approach can help reduce the impact of randomness by providing a more robust estimate of the model's performance.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it implies the use of techniques such as fixing the random seed value and using cross-validation to ensure consistent and robust model performance.
