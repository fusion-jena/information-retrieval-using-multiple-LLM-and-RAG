The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline described in the given context is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is inferred from the specific application of the deep learning model mentioned, which is semantic segmentation for vegetation mapping. Semantic segmentation is a computer vision task that involves labeling each pixel in an image with a corresponding class, and CNNs are commonly used for this purpose due to their ability to effectively analyze spatial data. Additionally, CNNs are the most commonly used type of deep learning model for image analysis tasks, making it a likely choice for this study. However, the context does not explicitly specify the type of deep learning model used, so this inference is based on the given information and common practices in the field of deep learning for image analysis.
