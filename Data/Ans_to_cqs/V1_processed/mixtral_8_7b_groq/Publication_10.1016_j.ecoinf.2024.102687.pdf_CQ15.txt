The deep learning pipeline in the given context uses the Adam optimizer for fine-tuning the model. The Adam optimizer is a popular optimization algorithm used in training deep learning models. It is an adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm that combines the advantages of AdaGrad and RMSProp. Adam keeps an estimate of first moment (mean) and second moment (uncentered variance) of the gradients. The algorithm updates the weights based on the estimates of the first and second moments of the gradients.

The Adam optimizer was initialized with a default learning rate of 0.0001 and a weight decay of 0. The learning rate is a hyperparameter that controls how much to change the model in response to the estimated error each time the model weights are updated. The weight decay is a regularization technique that helps to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty to the loss function based on the size of the weights.

The experiments were conducted in PyTorch, which is an open-source machine learning library based on the Torch library. PyTorch provides a wide range of optimizers, including Adam, SGD, and many others. The choice of the Adam optimizer in this case might be due to its ability to adapt to the learning rate and its efficiency in handling sparse gradients.

It is important to note that no other optimization techniques, such as learning rate scheduling or momentum, were mentioned in the context. However, the use of a fixed learning rate and weight decay suggests that the focus was on fine-tuning the pre-trained model rather than training the model from scratch.
