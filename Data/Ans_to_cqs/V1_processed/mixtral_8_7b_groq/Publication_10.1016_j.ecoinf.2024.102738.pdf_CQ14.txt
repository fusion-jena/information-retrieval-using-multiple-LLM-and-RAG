Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, such as through methods like grid search or random search. The text focuses on the data sets, indices, and classification methods used in a land use and land cover (LULC) study in the Amazon forest, but it does not mention the specific techniques employed for hyperparameter optimization. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query with certainty based on the given context.
