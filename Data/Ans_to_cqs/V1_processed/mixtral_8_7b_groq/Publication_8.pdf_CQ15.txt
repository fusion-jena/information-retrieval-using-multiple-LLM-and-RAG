The specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that transfer learning was implemented to initialize the model weights pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. This suggests that some form of fine-tuning was used during the training of the model.

Fine-tuning is a common optimization technique used in deep learning, where a pre-trained model is further trained on a new dataset. This is often done using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or adaptive moment estimation (Adam), which are two popular optimization algorithms used in deep learning.

SGD is a simple optimization algorithm that updates the model weights based on the gradient of the loss function. It is widely used due to its simplicity and efficiency. However, it can be sensitive to the learning rate, which can make convergence difficult.

Adam, on the other hand, is an optimization algorithm that combines the advantages of SGD and other optimization algorithms. It uses an adaptive learning rate that is calculated based on the historical gradient information. This makes it more robust to the choice of learning rate and can result in faster convergence.

Therefore, it is likely that either SGD or Adam was used as an optimization technique in the deep learning pipeline described in the provided context. However, without explicit mention, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
