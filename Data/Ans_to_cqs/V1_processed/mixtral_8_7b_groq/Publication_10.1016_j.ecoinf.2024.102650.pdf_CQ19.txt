Based on the provided context, the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model are not mentioned. However, it is mentioned that the enhanced representation through knowledge integration (ERNIE) model was used for Chinese named entity recognition (Wang et al., 2020). ERNIE is a model that achieved significant results in previous studies by learning prior semantic relationships and word order features from massive amounts of data. It earned first place for a mixed-language emotional analysis task at the International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation 2020.

Additionally, the proposed framework for on-site text classification and knowledge mining for large-scale projects construction by integrated intelligent approach was discussed in Tian et al. (2021). However, the specific deep learning frameworks used in this proposed framework were not specified.

In summary, while the ERNIE model was mentioned as a deep learning model used in a specific task, the deep learning frameworks used to build the models in the studies mentioned in the context are not explicitly stated.
