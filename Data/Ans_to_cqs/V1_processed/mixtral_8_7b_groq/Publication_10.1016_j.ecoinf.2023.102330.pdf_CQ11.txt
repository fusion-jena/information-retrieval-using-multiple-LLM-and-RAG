The provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on a study that used point count and automated recording unit (ARU) distance sampling models to estimate the density of northern bobwhite on Di-Lane Plantation Wildlife Management Area in Burke County, Georgia, during autumn 2016-2018. The authors used a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a score detection threshold of 0.95 to analyze the recordings. However, there is no mention of the data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study.
