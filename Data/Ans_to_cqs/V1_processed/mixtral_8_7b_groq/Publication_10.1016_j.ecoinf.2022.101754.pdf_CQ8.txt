Unfortunately, there is no information in the provided context about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used for estimating forest biomass. The sources cited in the context mainly focus on the methodology, results, and applications of using LiDAR and Landsat data for biomass estimation, but they do not provide any details about the code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
