The provided context does not mention any deep learning pipelines or datasets commonly used in deep learning, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it discusses a classification study using three classifiers (RF, SVM, MARS) and two sets of classes (7C and 13C) on 10 variable sets. These variable sets are derived from 17 variables, including spectral bands, spectral indices, and texture indices.

The context describes the application of the Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) method to determine the most important variables based on the largest overall accuracy (OA). The RFE method is combined with the Random Forest (RF) algorithm to remove the variable with the lowest contribution stepwise.

The datasets used in this study are related to remote sensing and consist of combinations of spectral bands, spectral indices, texture indices, and a Digital Surface Model (DSM). The context provides a table (Table 2) describing the different combinations of input datasets used for the classifications. However, the table is not provided directly in the text.

In summary, the provided context discusses a classification study using three classifiers and two sets of classes on 10 variable sets derived from 17 remote sensing-related variables. The study uses the Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) method to determine the most important variables. The context does not mention any deep learning pipelines or datasets commonly used in deep learning.
