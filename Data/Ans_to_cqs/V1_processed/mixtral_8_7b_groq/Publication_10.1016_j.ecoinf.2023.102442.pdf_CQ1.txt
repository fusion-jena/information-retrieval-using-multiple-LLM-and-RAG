The methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipelines for the studies mentioned in the context are primarily based on satellite imagery and public datasets available on cloud-based platforms.

In the study by Gallwey et al. (2020), the data was collected using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. They used a multispectral convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect artisanal small-scale mining (ASGM) in Ghana. The CNN was trained using labeled Sentinel-2 images, and the model was able to accurately detect ASGM sites.

Similarly, Couttenier et al. (2022) used satellite imagery to map artisanal and small-scale mines at a large scale. They used a deep learning model to classify mining areas and non-mining areas using high-resolution satellite images.

The study by Dethier et al. (2023) used satellite imagery to quantify the increase in alluvial mining in tropical rivers. They used a combination of Landsat and Sentinel-2 images to estimate the sediment load in rivers caused by mining activities.

The studies mentioned above have used satellite imagery as the primary source of raw data. However, other studies have used public datasets available on cloud-based platforms. For instance, the study by Girardin et al. (2016) used MODIS satellite data available on NASA's Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) to study the seasonal trends of Amazonian rainforest phenology, net primary productivity, and carbon allocation.

Moreover, the studies have used cloud-based platforms such as Google Earth Engine (GEE) for processing and analyzing the satellite imagery. GEE provides a public catalog containing petabytes of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets, allowing for high-performance and rapid planetary-scale processing and analysis of images (Gorelick et al., 2017).

In summary, the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipelines for the studies mentioned in the context are primarily based on satellite imagery and public datasets available on cloud-based platforms. These platforms allow for high-performance and rapid processing and analysis of images, enabling accurate and timely detection of mining activities and other environmental changes.
