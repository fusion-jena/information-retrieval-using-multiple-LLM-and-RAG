Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, the authors did mention employing four evaluation metrics (coefficient of determination (R2), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and error relative global accuracy (ERGAS)) to assess and contrast the disparities between the predicted and actual images. These metrics can provide insights into the model's performance and help identify potential issues, but they do not directly contribute to improving the model's generalizability.

In the context of remote sensing and image processing, ensuring a diverse dataset could involve using data from various geographical locations, different times of the year, and various environmental conditions. Cross-validation is a common technique to assess the performance of a model and its ability to generalize. Stratified splitting, on the other hand, can help ensure that the training and testing datasets have a similar distribution of samples, especially when dealing with imbalanced classes.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention these techniques, it is possible that the authors employed them to enhance the deep learning model's generalizability. However, without further information, it is not possible to definitively answer this question.
