The data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in this study has not been specified in the provided context. The study utilizes two independent data sources: the iNaturalist database for plant photographs and the TRY database for trait measurements. However, there is no information on where or how the data and the deep learning pipeline are made available for others to access or reproduce the results. It is possible that the data and pipeline may be available upon request to the authors or through their institutional repositories. Therefore, I would recommend contacting the authors for more information if you are interested in accessing the data or the deep learning pipeline.
