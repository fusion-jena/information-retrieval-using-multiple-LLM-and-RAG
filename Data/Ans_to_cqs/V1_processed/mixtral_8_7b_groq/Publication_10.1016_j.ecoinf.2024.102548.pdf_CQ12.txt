Based on the provided context, the deep learning models used in the pipeline are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This is inferred from the mention of various CNN architectures such as VGG-19, ResNet-50, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, and EfficientNet. These models are commonly used for image-related tasks due to their ability to extract and learn hierarchical features from image data. CNNs are particularly suitable for tasks where spatial information and local correlations in the data are important, such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation.
