The specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the performance of YOLO_MRC was explored on the Bactrocera cucurbitae pest dataset and the public dataset Pest_24_640.

The Bactrocera cucurbitae pest dataset is a dataset that was specifically created for this study, and it is used for training and testing the YOLO_MRC model on the task of detecting a specific type of pest.

The Pest_24_640 dataset, on the other hand, is a public dataset, which means that it is available for anyone to use. This dataset is used for benchmark experiments with several other excellent SOTA models to explore the performance of YOLO_MRC on multiclass pest detection tasks.

It is worth noting that the models used for comparison in the study, such as YOLOv5s-ECA, Fast-RCNN (Mobilenetv2), YOLOv5Ghost, and YOLOv7Tiny, may have been trained on different datasets, such as COCO, PASCAL VOC, or ImageNet. However, the specific datasets used for training these models are not mentioned in the provided context.

In summary, the provided context mentions the use of two specific datasets, the Bactrocera cucurbitae pest dataset and the Pest_24_640 dataset, in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does not provide information on the datasets used for training the models used for comparison.
