The deep learning pipeline in the study mentioned above utilizes several data formats, including images, CSV files, and labeled numbers.

Firstly, the study works with single-tree point clouds, images of single-trees, and CSV files containing the attributes used to produce the images. These CSV files are crucial for processing and understanding the images. Additionally, the pipeline includes clusters of numbers in two different point-thickness settings, labeled numbers, preprocessed images of the numbers, and tables containing the results of digit recognition. These components are essential for training the deep learning models.

Next, the study introduces three models (Models 4, 5, and 6) trained using the clusters of extracted numbers as input for training. This data is likely in a format that can be used by the deep learning framework, such as a multi-dimensional array or a preprocessed image format.

Lastly, the researchers used the Models 1, 2, and 3 trained with the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset of handwritten digits. The MNIST dataset is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. This dataset is in image format, with each image representing a digit from 0 to 9.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline in this study utilizes images, CSV files, and labeled numbers. These data formats are essential for training the deep learning models, processing and understanding the images, and evaluating the model's performance.
