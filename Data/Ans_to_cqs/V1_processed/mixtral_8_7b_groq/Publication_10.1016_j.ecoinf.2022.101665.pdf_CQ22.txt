The provided context discusses the evaluation of thematic maps produced by a calibrated statistical prediction method, rather than a deep learning model specifically. However, it does mention two metrics used to evaluate the performance of the map accuracy estimates: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Excess Carriage (MEC).

The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is a standard way of measuring the error of a model in predicting quantitative data. It is calculated as the square root of the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values. A lower RMSE indicates better performance.

The Mean Excess Carriage (MEC) is a measure of the average magnitude of the errors, rather than just the number of errors. It is calculated as the average of the absolute differences between the predicted and actual values, where the actual values are greater than the predicted values. A lower MEC indicates better performance.

Additionally, the context also mentions that relative deviations of the accuracy estimates from their reference metrics were expressed as percentages, for example, the relative RMSE (rRMSE) was computed.

It is important to note that these metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the map accuracy estimates, not the deep learning model directly. However, these metrics can still be used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model in predicting quantitative data.

In summary, the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Excess Carriage (MEC) are the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the map accuracy estimates in the provided context. These metrics can also be used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model in predicting quantitative data.
