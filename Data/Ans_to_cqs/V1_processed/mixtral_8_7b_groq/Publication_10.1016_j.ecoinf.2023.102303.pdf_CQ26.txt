The provided context does not give specific information about the data bias mitigation techniques used during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of a semi-supervised contrastive learning approach for training a deep learning model on the FishInTurbidWater dataset.

In semi-supervised contrastive learning, a self-supervised model is first trained and then fine-tuned on the weakly labeled fish dataset. This approach can help reduce the impact of reliance on a high volume of accurately labeled data, which is often a source of data bias.

Moreover, the dataset was weakly labeled and quickly collected to contribute to the first weakly-supervised fish dataset in turbid waters. This suggests that the data collection process may have prioritized diversity in the dataset to ensure that it is representative of the turbid water environment.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of specific data bias mitigation techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, it does suggest that the use of semi-supervised contrastive learning and weak supervision may have helped reduce the impact of data bias in the deep learning pipeline.
