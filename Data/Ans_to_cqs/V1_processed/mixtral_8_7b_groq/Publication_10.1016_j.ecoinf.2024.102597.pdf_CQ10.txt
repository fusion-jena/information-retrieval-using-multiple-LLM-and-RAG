I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The text mentions the use of deep learning algorithms for estimating water quality parameters (WQP) in small and medium-sized lakes. However, it does not specify the code repository or location where the implementation of these algorithms can be found. Therefore, I am unable to provide the requested link to the deep learning pipeline.
