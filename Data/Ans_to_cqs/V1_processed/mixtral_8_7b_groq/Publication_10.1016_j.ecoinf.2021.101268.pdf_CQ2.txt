Based on the provided context, the deep learning (DL) pipeline in the discussed study involves the use of image data. The research focuses on feature representation from hand-crafted and deep-learning perspectives in the context of the Peruvian Amazon Forestry Dataset. This dataset includes 59,441 samples from ten of the most profitable and endangered species. Six different commercial cameras were used to ensure variability and to develop flexible solutions for real-world conditions.

The DL techniques used in this study are convolutional neural networks (CNN), which are particularly suited for image processing tasks. CNNs process data on two levels: a convolutional block for automatic feature extraction and fully connected layers to establish feature-output correlation. The convolutional block comprises convolutional, ReLU, and max-pooling layers, which are designed to process local sections of the input space and diversify features by applying a set of parallel filters.

Although the context does not explicitly mention other data formats like audio, video, or CSV, it is essential to note that CNNs and DL methods can be applied to various data formats. For instance, CNNs have been successfully used for audio signal processing, video analysis, and even time-series data when represented as images (such as spectrograms). Therefore, while the specific context focuses on image data, the DL pipeline can be adapted to handle other data formats as well.
