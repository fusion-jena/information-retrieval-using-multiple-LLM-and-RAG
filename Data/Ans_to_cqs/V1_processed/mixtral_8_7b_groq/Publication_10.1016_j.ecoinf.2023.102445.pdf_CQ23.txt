Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, the paper does describe the use of ablation experiments to evaluate the enhancements made to various components of the network architecture. These experiments involve training and testing the model with different modified structures, which could potentially help in assessing the model's performance across different scenarios and contribute to its generalizability.

Additionally, the authors have specified consistent training parameter settings for all the experiments, including a batch size of 16, input image resolution of 640 Ã— 640, 150 epochs, a learning rate of 0.01, and the Adam optimizer. Using the same training parameters for all the models ensures that any differences in performance can be attributed to the modifications made to the network architecture, rather than differences in training parameters.

Furthermore, the authors have reported evaluation indices such as Precision (P), Recall (R), and mean Average Precision (mAP) for each experiment. These metrics provide insights into the model's performance in detecting objects and can help in assessing its generalizability.

However, without explicit information about the diversity of the dataset used, or the use of techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting, it is challenging to definitively comment on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model in this study.
