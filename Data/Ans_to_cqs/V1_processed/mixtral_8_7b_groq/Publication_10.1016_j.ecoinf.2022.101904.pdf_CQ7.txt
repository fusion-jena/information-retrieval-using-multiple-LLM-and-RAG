The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the data split is based on the ratio of training data to reference data. The training ratio was varied from 10% to 90% in increments of 10% to evaluate the impact of the data split on the final accuracy of wetland mapping. This implies that the data was divided into training and test (or validation) sets, with the proportion of training data changing according to the selected ratio. The specific method of splitting the data, such as random sampling or stratified sampling, is not specified in the given text. Therefore, while the context provides information on the importance of data split and the effect of different training ratios, it does not explicitly mention the criteria used for splitting the data.
