Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. However, the text does discuss the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process, which includes data acquisition, processing, and analytical determination steps. It can be inferred that within this process, there would be steps to train, serialize, and deploy a deep learning model.

The KDD process involves identifying the aim for a specific study area, pre-selecting useful data, making analytical determinations, optimizing and elaborating results, mapping and interpreting results, and making decisions. In the context of deep learning, training a model would be part of the analytical determination step, where patterns or relationships within the dataset are detected. Once the model is trained, it can be serialized for deployment.

Model serialization is the process of saving the trained model into a file, which can then be used for deployment. This allows the model to be easily loaded and used in different platforms or environments. Common model serialization formats include HDF5, JSON, XML, and protocol buffers.

Platform selection would depend on the specific requirements of the project. For example, if the deep learning model needs to be integrated into a web application, a cloud-based platform like AWS SageMaker or Google Cloud AI Platform could be used. If the model needs to run on an edge device, a lightweight platform like TensorFlow Lite or ONNX Runtime would be more appropriate.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not explicitly describe the process of deploying a trained deep learning model, it can be inferred that this process would be part of the larger KDD process. Specific steps, such as model serialization and platform selection, would be carried out as needed based on the requirements of the project.
