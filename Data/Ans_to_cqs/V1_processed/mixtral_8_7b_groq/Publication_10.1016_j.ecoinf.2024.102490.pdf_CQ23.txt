Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of measures such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, there are several other techniques mentioned that were used to ensure the robustness and precision of the models.

Firstly, the study used an 80-20 split of the data, where 80% of the data was used for training and 20% for evaluation. This approach allows for a thorough assessment of model performance on unseen data.

Secondly, two metrics were used to evaluate the accuracy of the models: the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and the true skill statistics (TSS). These metrics provide a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance, particularly in imbalanced datasets, which is common in biodiversity studies.

Thirdly, to ensure the robustness of the results, committee averaging and weighted mean approaches were applied to create separate ensemble models for each climate scenario and period. Ensemble methods like these can help reduce overfitting and improve the generalizability of the models.

Lastly, when selecting the final ensemble models, special attention was given to those with a TSS score of â‰¥0.7. This criterion ensures that only models with a satisfactory level of accuracy are considered for further analysis.

Therefore, while the text does not explicitly mention the techniques you listed, it does describe several other methods that were used to ensure the robustness and generalizability of the models.
