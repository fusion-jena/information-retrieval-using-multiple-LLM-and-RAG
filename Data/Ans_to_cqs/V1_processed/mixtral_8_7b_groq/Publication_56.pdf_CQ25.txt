Based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model is land use classification. This model is used in the context of the European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) for analyzing remote sensing data, particularly Sentinel-2 time series. The model's classification function is intended to aid in the understanding of CAP activities where payments to farmers need to be justified. The model's interpretability is a significant aspect of its design, as it is crucial in applications involving public budget management and policy compliance. The model's development and interpretation are discussed in the literature "AI: Interpreting, Explaining and Visualizing Deep Learning" and other sources such as "Estimating and understanding crop yields with explainable deep learning in the Indian wheat belt" and "Semantically interpretable activation maps: What-where-how explanations within CNNs". However, the specific architecture of the model (e.g., classification, segmentation, detection) is not explicitly mentioned in the context.
