The specific deep learning (DL) optimization techniques used in the biodiversity monitoring pipeline are stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants, such as Adam.

Deep learning models are typically trained using optimization algorithms that update the model's parameters based on the gradient of the loss function. The most common optimization algorithm used in DL is stochastic gradient descent (SGD). SGD updates the model's parameters by computing the gradient of the loss function for a single training example or a small batch of training examples, rather than the entire training dataset. This approach makes SGD computationally efficient and well-suited for training large DL models.

However, SGD has some limitations, such as sensitivity to the learning rate and slow convergence. To address these limitations, several variants of SGD have been proposed, including momentum-based methods, adaptive learning rate methods, and second-order optimization methods.

One popular variant of SGD is Adam, which stands for Adaptive Moment Estimation. Adam combines the advantages of two popular optimization algorithms, momentum and adaptive learning rate methods. Specifically, Adam maintains an exponentially decaying average of past gradients and squared gradients, which are used to adapt the learning rate for each parameter. This approach allows Adam to effectively handle sparse gradients and non-stationary objectives, making it a popular choice for DL applications.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline for biodiversity monitoring uses optimization techniques such as SGD and its variant, Adam, to train deep learning models for classification and detection tasks. These optimization algorithms are chosen for their computational efficiency and ability to handle large-scale DL models.
