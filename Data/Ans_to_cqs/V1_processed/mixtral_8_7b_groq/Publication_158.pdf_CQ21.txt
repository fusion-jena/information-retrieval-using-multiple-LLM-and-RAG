Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include the calculation of metrics such as F1-Score, Accuracy, and Kappa, and the generation of a confusion matrix.

In the study, two models were trained: an ensemble of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and a Random Forest classifier. After training, the performance of these models was evaluated using various metrics. For the ensemble CNN, the F1-Score, Accuracy, and Kappa were calculated for each land cover class, including Bare Grass, Pasture Water, Crop, Forest Wetland, and Shrub. These metrics provide insights into the model's performance in terms of precision, recall, and overall accuracy. Similarly, for the Random Forest classifier, F1-Score, Accuracy, and Kappa were calculated.

Additionally, a confusion matrix was generated for the ensemble CNN. A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model. It compares the actual values (referred to as the reference) with the predicted values (referred to as the predicted) and provides information about the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. This matrix can be used to calculate various metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1-Score.

However, there is no mention of saliency maps in the provided context. Saliency maps are a way to visualize the importance of input features in the prediction made by a model. They highlight the parts of the input that the model found most important in making its prediction.

In summary, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include the calculation of metrics such as F1-Score, Accuracy, and Kappa, and the generation of a confusion matrix. These steps provide insights into the model's performance and help in evaluating its effectiveness.
