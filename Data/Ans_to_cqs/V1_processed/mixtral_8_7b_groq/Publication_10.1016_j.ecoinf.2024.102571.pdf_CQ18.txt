The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves dividing the data into three sets: training, validation, and testing. Seventy percent of the data is used for training, which involves adjusting the weights and biases of the neural network to minimize the error between the predicted and actual output. Fifteen percent of the data is used for validation, which is used to tune the model's hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. The remaining 15% of the data is used for model testing, which evaluates the model's performance on unseen data.

The performance of the model is monitored using the coefficient of determination (R2), which measures the proportion of the variance in the output that is predictable from the input factors. An R2 value close to 1 indicates that the model's predictions are highly accurate, while an R2 value close to 0 indicates that the model's predictions are not much better than random guesses.

The training process is further monitored for dimensional problems, which can occur when the input factors have different scales or units. To address this issue, the input factors are standardized to have zero mean and unit variance, which ensures that each input factor contributes equally to the model's predictions.

Additionally, the model's performance is evaluated at a turning point, which is the point at which the model's performance on the validation set starts to degrade. This turning point indicates that the model is starting to overfit the training data, and the model's hyperparameters are adjusted accordingly to prevent further overfitting.

Finally, the model's performance is evaluated in terms of per capita GHGdwts, which is the predicted output divided by the population size. This metric allows for a fair comparison of the model's performance across different countries or regions, as it takes into account the differences in population size.

Overall, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves dividing the data into three sets, using R2 to measure the model's accuracy, standardizing the input factors to prevent dimensional problems, monitoring the model's performance at a turning point, and evaluating the model's performance in terms of per capita GHGdwts.
