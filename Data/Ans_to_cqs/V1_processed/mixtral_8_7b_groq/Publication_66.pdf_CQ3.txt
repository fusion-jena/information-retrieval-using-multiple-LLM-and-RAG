Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for this particular study. The study focuses on comparing the performance of deep learning models with other prediction methods for classifying foraging behavior in seabirds.

However, in general, data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines for computer vision tasks can include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest in an image. It helps the model to learn the spatial location and size of the objects.

2. Instance segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image according to the object it belongs to. It helps the model to learn the precise shape and location of objects, even if they overlap or are occluded.

3. Semantic segmentation: Similar to instance segmentation, but without distinguishing between individual instances of the same object class.

4. Landmark annotation: This technique involves identifying and labeling key points or landmarks on objects, such as the corners of a bounding box or the joints of a human body.

5. Scene classification: This technique involves labeling an entire image according to its overall content, such as "indoor" or "outdoor".

The choice of data annotation technique depends on the specific task and the level of detail required for the model to make accurate predictions. In the context of the provided study, it is possible that the GPS track and dive data used for training the deep learning models were pre-processed and cleaned, but the specific annotation technique is not mentioned.
