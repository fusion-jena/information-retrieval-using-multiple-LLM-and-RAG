I am unable to provide the exact code repository link of the deep learning pipeline for tree species identification as it was not included in the provided context. However, the context does mention several studies and authors who have worked on tree species classification and identification using various methods, including machine learning and remote sensing.

For instance, Immitzer et al. (2012) used random forest for tree species classification with very high spatial resolution 8-band WorldView-2 satellite data. Similarly, Jernej et al. (2023) developed a machine learning forest simulator (MLFS) using R package for data-driven assessment of the future state of forests. Jiaxin Kong (2020) classified and identified subtropical evergreen deciduous broad-leaved mixed forest tree species based on UAV remote sensing images. Judith et al. (2023) evaluated the predictive performance of random forest on the identification of mangrove species in arid environments.

Moreover, Kim and Hong (2008) identified tree species from high-resolution satellite data, and Hadlich et al. (2018) recognized Amazonian tree species in the field using bark tissues spectra. Xu et al. (2013) researched object-oriented classification using ERC-forests and Rainfalling watershed algorithm, and Hu (2017) extracted non-commercial forest plots dynamic change based on object-oriented classification.

Therefore, it is possible that the deep learning pipeline for tree species identification developed by these authors or researchers is available on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. I would recommend searching for the repositories of these authors or studies to find the code.
