Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling being applied in the described deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the architecture of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model, its training process, and the use of the model for species distribution modeling (SDMs).

However, the context does mention that the researchers address issues such as class imbalance and sampling bias in diverse datasets. While not explicitly stated, it is possible that they employ data augmentation techniques to tackle these issues. For instance, they might use techniques like oversampling the minority class or applying specific augmentations to balance the class distribution.

In general, data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in computer vision tasks to increase the size of the training dataset and improve the model's ability to generalize. In the context of SDMs, data augmentation might involve creating synthetic samples of species occurrences or non-occurrences while considering the underlying environmental factors.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of flipping, rotating, or scaling as data augmentation techniques, it is possible that they are employed to address class imbalance and sampling bias in the datasets used in the study.
