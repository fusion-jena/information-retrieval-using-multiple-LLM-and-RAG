The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that a comparison experiment between SAE (Stacked Auto-Encoder, a deep learning method) and SVM (Support Vector Machine, a traditional machine learning method) was conducted using six different types of Landsat images.

In general, for deep learning model training, the data is usually split into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune the model's hyperparameters and select the best model, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final performance of the selected model.

In the context of remote sensing image classification, the training set typically consists of labeled samples of different land cover classes, which are used to train the deep learning model. The validation set is used to evaluate the model's performance during the training process and adjust the model's hyperparameters to prevent overfitting. The testing set is used to evaluate the final performance of the trained model on unseen data.

In the study mentioned in the context, the authors used spectral data from three phenological stages of paddy rice (sowing, green, and harvest) to enhance the spectral separability between paddy rice and other land cover classes. These spectral data were combined with phenological features using Ppf-CM (Phenological Profiles from Cloud-Masked MODIS data) to improve the performance of deep learning in detecting invasive S. alterniflora.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the data used for deep learning model training in this study were likely split into training, validation, and testing sets, and the training set consisted of spectral data from three phenological stages of paddy rice and other land cover classes, labeled with their corresponding class labels. However, the specific criteria used for splitting the data are not provided in the context.
