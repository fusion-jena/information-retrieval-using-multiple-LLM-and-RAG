The provided context does not give information about the specific hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of a Raspberry Pi 3B+ for the Rasp2SPAD prototype development. The Raspberry Pi 3B+ is a single-board computer that features a quad-core ARM processor and 1 GB of RAM. It is not designed for deep learning tasks that require significant computational power and memory.

In the context, a simple linear model (LM), a generalized linear model with a gamma distribution (GLM), and an artificial neural network (ANN) were used for SPAD value modeling. However, it does not specify the hardware resources used for training these models. Typically, deep learning models are trained on powerful hardware such as GPUs or TPUs, which are not available on the Raspberry Pi 3B+.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the deep learning model was not trained on the Raspberry Pi 3B+, but on a more powerful hardware system. However, the context does not provide information on the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model.
