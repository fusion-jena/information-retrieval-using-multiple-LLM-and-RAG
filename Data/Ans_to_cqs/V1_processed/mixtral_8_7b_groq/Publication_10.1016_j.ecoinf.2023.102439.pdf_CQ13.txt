The provided context does not explicitly mention the learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model. However, it does provide information about the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model and the NARX model used in the study.

The ANN model consists of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The input layer includes three processing elements (neurons) corresponding to the Land Surface Temperature (LST), temperature, and precipitation parameters. The Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data was used as the output layer. The number of neurons in the hidden layer was incrementally adjusted to determine the optimal configuration that yields the best results.

The study also mentions the use of a hybrid model, which combines wavelet analysis and the NARX ANN algorithm to enhance the performance of the NARX ANN model. The hybrid model improved learning success, with an increase of 18.7% in Iznik and 7.3% in Alanya.

Therefore, while the context does not provide specific information about the learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model, it does mention the use of the ANN and NARX models and a hybrid model that combines wavelet analysis and the NARX ANN algorithm.
