Based on the provided context, the specific type of deep learning model (Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, or Transformers) used in the pipeline is not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is likely to be a type of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) due to the mention of hyperparameters such as the number of layers, number of neurons, dropout rate, learning rate, and batch size. These hyperparameters are commonly associated with ANNs.

Moreover, the study by Liu and Chen (2012) mentioned in the context developed ML models based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) using meteorological conditions to predict the temperature in water masses. Although the study does not explicitly mention the use of deep learning models, ANNs can be considered as the precursor to deep learning models.

Therefore, while the specific type of deep learning model is not explicitly mentioned in the context, it is likely to be a type of ANN.
