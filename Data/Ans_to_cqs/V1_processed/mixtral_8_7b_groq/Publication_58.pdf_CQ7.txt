The data was split into three sets for the deep learning model training: a learning set, a validation set, and a test set. The learning set and validation set were derived from four of the five study areas, while the test set was obtained from the remaining isolated scene. This test set contained all the classes for both the land cover (LC) and land use (LU) nomenclatures, and represented the diverse New Caledonian landscape, including urban, mining, mountainous, and forest environments.

The learning set and validation set were used to train and validate the deep learning architectures, while the test set was used to compute the final confusion matrix and quality metrics. The test set was essential to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

The data splitting criteria were not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the data was split based on the study areas, with four areas used for learning and validation, and the fifth area used for testing. This approach ensures that the model is trained and validated on a variety of landscapes, and tested on a completely new and independent scene.

Moreover, the context mentioned that the data was split into a learning set, a validation set, and a test set that were mutually exclusive, indicating that there was no overlap between the sets. This is a common practice in machine learning to ensure that the model is evaluated on data it has never seen before, thereby providing a more accurate estimate of its generalization ability.

In summary, the data was split based on the study areas, with four areas used for learning and validation, and the fifth area used for testing. This approach ensures that the model is trained and validated on a variety of landscapes, and tested on a completely new and independent scene. The learning set and validation set were mutually exclusive, ensuring that the model is evaluated on data it has never seen before.
