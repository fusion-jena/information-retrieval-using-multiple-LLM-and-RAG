The provided context does not give specific information about the datasets used in deep learning pipelines such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention the use of hyperspectral data for predicting water quality parameters.

In the study by Maier, P.M., Keller, S., Hinz, S., 2021, they used WASI simulation data for estimating chlorophyll a concentration of inland water bodies using deep learning algorithms. Similarly, the study by Olmanson, L.G., Brezonik, P.L., Bauer, M.E., 2013, used airborne hyperspectral remote sensing data to assess spatial distribution of water quality characteristics in large rivers.

Therefore, it can be inferred that hyperspectral data can be used as a dataset in deep learning pipelines for predicting water quality parameters. However, the context does not provide enough information to answer the query about the specific datasets used in deep learning pipelines such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
