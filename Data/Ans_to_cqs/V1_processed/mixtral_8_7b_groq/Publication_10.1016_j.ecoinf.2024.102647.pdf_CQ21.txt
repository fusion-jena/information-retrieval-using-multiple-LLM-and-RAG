Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training for groundwater (GW) salinity hazard maps. However, we can infer some possible postprocessing steps that might have been taken based on the given information.

Firstly, the training and testing of the models involved evaluating their performance using various metrics. For the statistical models, the performance was assessed using frequency ratio (FR) and statistical index (SI). On the other hand, the machine learning models' performance was evaluated using coefficient of determination (R2), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE), and correlation coefficient (COR). Therefore, calculating these metrics after training the models is likely to be one of the postprocessing steps.

Secondly, the context mentions the use of Random Forest (RF) and Classification and Regression Trees (CART) models, which are machine learning algorithms. These models' outputs can be used to generate saliency maps, which highlight the most important features that contribute to the model's predictions. However, the text does not explicitly mention the use of saliency maps in this study.

Lastly, the development of standard GW salinity vulnerability maps is mentioned in the context. Creating such maps would require postprocessing steps such as thresholding the model outputs to create binary or categorical maps, and possibly combining the outputs of multiple models to create an ensemble map.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific postprocessing steps taken, it is likely that the models' performance metrics were calculated, and the outputs of the machine learning models may have been used to generate saliency maps. Additionally, postprocessing steps such as thresholding and ensemble modeling may have been used to create the final GW salinity vulnerability maps.
