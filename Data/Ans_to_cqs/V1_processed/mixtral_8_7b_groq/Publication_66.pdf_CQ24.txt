The provided context discusses the use of deep learning models to predict diving behavior in seabirds using GPS data, but it does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does mention that a random hyperparameter search was conducted to determine the optimum model structure. This process likely involved some level of randomness, although the specific methods used are not detailed.

In general, deep learning models often involve randomness in various stages of the pipeline, such as the initialization of model weights, the selection of mini-batches for stochastic gradient descent, and the selection of hyperparameters. To ensure reproducibility and manage randomness, deep learning practitioners may employ strategies such as:

1. Fixing the random seed value: By setting a fixed seed value, the sequence of random numbers generated by the algorithm will be the same across different runs, ensuring reproducibility. This can be done in many deep learning libraries, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, by calling a function (e.g., `tf.random.set_seed()` or `torch.manual_seed()`) and providing a seed value.
2. Using deterministic algorithms: Some algorithms, such as the Adam optimizer, have a deterministic version that does not rely on randomness. Using these algorithms can help reduce the impact of randomness on the training process.
3. Running multiple trials: To account for the impact of randomness, it is common practice to run deep learning models multiple times with different random seeds and average the results. This can help provide a more robust estimate of the model's performance.
4. Hyperparameter optimization: Techniques such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization can be used to systematically explore the space of hyperparameters and find the combination that leads to the best performance. These methods can help manage the impact of randomness on model performance by ensuring that a wide range of hyperparameters are explored.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention these strategies, they are common practices in deep learning and could have been employed in the study described.
