Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when the training of the models is complete. Commonly, in machine learning and statistical modeling, training of a model can be considered complete when there are no significant improvements in model performance on a validation dataset, despite further training. This is often observed as a plateau in the validation loss or a stable performance metric. However, the context provided here does not mention any specific criteria related to validation loss or performance plateau as indicators of training completion. Instead, it focuses on the data splitting procedure, model evaluation metrics (AUC-ROC and TSS), and ensemble model creation. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query from the given context.
