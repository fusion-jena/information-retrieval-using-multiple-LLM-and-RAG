The provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text focuses on the methodology, results, and discussions related to the use of TensorFlow in species identification. While it does mention the use of the warbleR package and other tools, there is no information about where the code for the deep learning pipeline is stored or made available. It is possible that the code repository is not publicly available or was not included in the text. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
