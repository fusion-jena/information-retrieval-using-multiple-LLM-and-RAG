The provided context does not contain specific information about techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of data augmentation to increase the amount of training data for a deep learning model used for identifying tropical bat calls.

In the study "Automatic standardized processing and identification of tropical bat calls using deep learning approaches" published in Biological Conservation, the authors used data augmentation to increase the size of their training dataset. They applied time-stretching and pitch-shifting to the original audio files to create new samples. This technique can help to increase the diversity of the training data and reduce overfitting, but it does not directly address data bias.

In addition, the context mentions the use of BatNet, a deep learning model that uses a cascade of multiple layers of nonlinear processing units for feature extraction from low-level features to high-level features. The model also includes shortcuts among layers to prevent information loss. However, it does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query about techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection are not mentioned in the context.
