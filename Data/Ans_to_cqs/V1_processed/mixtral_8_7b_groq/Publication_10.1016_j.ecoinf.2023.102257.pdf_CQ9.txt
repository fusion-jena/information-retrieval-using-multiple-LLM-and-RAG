The provided article does not explicitly mention where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It is not specified in the abstract, materials and methods section, or in the list of references. The article focuses on the impact of machine learning (ML) model performance on tagging efficiency for species-detection in remote wildlife monitoring using camera traps and does not include information about the data repository.

The authors do mention several open-source species-level classification models that have been released, such as those by BÂ¨ohner et al., (2022), Norouzzadeh et al., (2018), Tabak et al., (2019, 2020, 2022), Vecvanags et al., (2022), and Whytock et al., (2021), but there is no information provided about the data repositories associated with these models.

In addition, the authors cite several methods papers related to camera trap image processing and analysis, such as Balantic and Donovan (2020), Beery et al., (2019), Buehler et al., (2019), and Bothmann et al., (2023), but again, there is no information provided about the data repositories associated with these studies.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is not available in any of the specified repositories (Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF). It is possible that the data repository is available in another location, or that it was not made publicly available. If you are interested in obtaining the data, it may be best to contact the authors directly for more information.
