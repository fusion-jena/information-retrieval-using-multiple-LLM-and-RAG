The provided context does not give specific details about how the raw data for the birdsong classification project was collected. It mainly focuses on the data augmentation techniques and deep learning strategies used in the project. However, it can be inferred that the raw data used in this study likely comes from audio recordings of various bird species in natural soundscapes. These recordings could have been obtained through different methods such as field surveys, sensors, or existing public datasets.

In ecology, field surveys are a common method for collecting data on wildlife, including bird species. These surveys can be conducted using various techniques, such as point counts, line transects, or area searches, to systematically record bird observations and/or audio recordings in specific habitats.

Sensor devices, such as automated audio recorders, can also be used to collect continuous audio data in the field. These devices can be deployed in different environments for extended periods, allowing for the recording of a wide range of bird vocalizations, even during times when human observers might not be present.

Additionally, the authors mention using the bird audio detection data set from the DCASE challenge, which suggests that they also utilized existing public datasets for their birdsong classification project. Publicly available datasets can be a valuable resource for researchers, providing access to large amounts of diverse data that would be difficult to collect individually.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly state the methods used for collecting raw data in the birdsong classification project, it can be inferred that the data was obtained through a combination of field surveys, sensor devices, and/or public datasets.
