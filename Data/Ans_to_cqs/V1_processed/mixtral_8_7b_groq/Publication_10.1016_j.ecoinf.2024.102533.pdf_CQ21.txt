Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include clustering the freshness data using six body parts parameters and evaluating the clustering results.

In step 5, the freshness data is clustered using a clustering method that groups similar data in one cluster and separates dissimilar data into other clusters. The number of clusters is determined based on the most suitable number of clusters from the previous stage, which becomes the standard for the proposed number of freshness classes. Each species attains several freshness classes based on its freshness stronghold.

In step 6, the clustering results are evaluated internally using Silhouette and Calinski-Harabasz methods. Clustering divides data into groups based on inherent characteristics without requiring external information such as classes, which become data labels. Therefore, the created groups align naturally with the data conditions and the clustering algorithm. High evaluation scores on both methods indicate that the clustering results obtained by the clustering method are the best outcome.

However, the provided context does not mention any postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix, which are commonly used in machine learning models. Saliency maps are used to highlight the important features in the input data that contribute to the model's prediction. Metrics calculation is used to evaluate the performance of the model using various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification model by comparing the predicted labels with the actual labels.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include clustering the freshness data using six body parts parameters and evaluating the clustering results. However, other postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix are not mentioned in the provided context.
