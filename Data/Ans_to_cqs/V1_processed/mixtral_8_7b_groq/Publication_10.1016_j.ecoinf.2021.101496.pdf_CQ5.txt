The provided context does not contain information about the datasets commonly used in deep learning pipelines, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context mainly discusses the use of a Raspberry Pi-based system for contact imaging and image analysis in the context of medical applications and agriculture. Specifically, it mentions the use of a Raspberry Pi and Pi Camera to capture images of winter rapeseed and calculate various parameters related to the SPAD value obtained by a SPAD-502Plus handheld sensor. Other papers mentioned in the context discuss topics such as fog computing for smart cities, optical assays in the food safety field, and thermal-RGB imaging for agricultural crop monitoring. However, none of these papers or the Kanani and Padole (2020) and Yildiz and Boyraz (2019) papers mentioned in the initial statement provide information about the datasets commonly used in deep learning pipelines.
