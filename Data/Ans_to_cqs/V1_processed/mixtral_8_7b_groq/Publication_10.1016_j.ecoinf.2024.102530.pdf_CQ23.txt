The provided context does not mention any deep learning model. Instead, it discusses a toolkit that includes various ecosystem service models, one of which is the Apis-FIS model. The Apis-FIS model is based on fuzzy logic, not deep learning. Therefore, I cannot provide information on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model because no such model is mentioned in the context.

The Apis-FIS model's generalizability may be affected by the quality and representativeness of the data used to develop it. The context states that the model was evaluated by comparing its output to field data from 12 sites. However, it does not provide information on how these sites were selected or whether they are representative of the broader population of interest.

Moreover, the Apis-FIS model's rules are based on expert data from the literature, which may also affect its generalizability. The model's rules may not capture all the complexities and variabilities of the real-world systems it aims to model.

Therefore, while the context provides some information on the evaluation of the Apis-FIS model, it does not mention any measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model.
