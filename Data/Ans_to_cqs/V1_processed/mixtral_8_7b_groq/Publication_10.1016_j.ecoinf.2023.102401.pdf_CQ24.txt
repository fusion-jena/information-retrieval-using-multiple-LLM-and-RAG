While the provided context does not directly discuss strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does mention the use of specific hyperparameters and techniques for data augmentation. These methods can indirectly help manage randomness and improve model performance.

Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the diversity of training data by applying random transformations to the images. Table 2 from the context presents the hyperparameters used for data augmentation, specifying the ranges and probabilities for each augmentation technique. These techniques include random horizontal flipping, random vertical flipping, and random rotation. By introducing this randomness in the training phase, deep learning models can learn to be more robust and generalize better to unseen data.

In addition to data augmentation, the choice of attention mechanisms can also impact the model's ability to focus on relevant image regions and suppress irrelevant background information. The context compares the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) with other existing attention modules, such as coordinate attention (CA) and squeeze excitation (SE). By evaluating these attention modules, the study demonstrates the CBAM's superiority in improving the model's ability to focus on relevant image regions, which can help reduce the impact of randomness in the input data.

While not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline often include:

1. Fixed random seed value: By setting a fixed random seed value, researchers ensure that the random number generator produces the same sequence of random numbers, which helps in reproducing the same data splits, data augmentations, and weight initializations across multiple runs.
2. Model ensemble: Combining multiple models trained with different random seeds can help reduce the impact of randomness on the final model performance.
3. Cross-validation: Dividing the data into multiple folds and training the model on each fold can help reduce overfitting and improve the model's generalization ability.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does mention data augmentation and attention mechanisms that can help manage randomness and improve model performance. Additionally, common strategies for handling randomness include setting a fixed random seed value, model ensemble, and cross-validation.
