The provided context does not contain information about any specific research or deep learning model, so I cannot directly answer the question about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of that particular model. However, I can provide a general answer about measures that are typically taken to ensure the generalizability of deep learning models.

To ensure that a deep learning model can generalize well to new, unseen data, it is important to use a diverse and representative dataset for training. This includes collecting data from a variety of sources, and ensuring that the data is representative of the population that the model will be applied to. Additionally, it is important to avoid overfitting, which can occur when a model learns the training data too well and is not able to generalize to new data. This can be prevented by using techniques such as regularization, dropout, and early stopping.

Cross-validation is another technique that is commonly used to ensure the generalizability of deep learning models. This involves dividing the dataset into multiple subsets, or folds, and training the model on one subset while testing it on another. This process is repeated for all the subsets, and the results are averaged to get a more robust estimate of the model's performance.

Stratified sampling is a method of sampling that ensures that the sample is representative of the population with respect to certain key variables. This can be useful when the dataset is imbalanced, for example, if there are many more examples of one class than another.

In addition, data preprocessing techniques such as data deduplication, data cleansing, data transformation, and data compression can help to improve the quality of the data and the performance of the model.

In summary, to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, it is important to use a diverse and representative dataset, avoid overfitting, use cross-validation, and consider data preprocessing techniques.
