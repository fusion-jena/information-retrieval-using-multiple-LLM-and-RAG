The provided context discusses the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in land use and land cover (LULC) classification, specifically the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) type of ANN. However, it does not explicitly mention any optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam.

The context does mention that the "nnet" package in R was used for ANN classification, which provides possibilities for adjusting weighted decay and size to counter the effects of model overfitting. Weight decay, also known as L2 regularization, is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages large weights and promotes a simpler model.

Additionally, the backpropagation learning algorithm was used during the training phase of the model. Backpropagation is an optimization technique used to train ANNs by minimizing the error between the predicted and actual outputs. It involves computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to the model's weights and updating the weights in the direction of the negative gradient.

However, the context does not provide information on more advanced optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam. SGD is an optimization algorithm used to train deep learning models by iteratively adjusting the model's weights in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function. Adam, on the other hand, is an adaptive optimization algorithm that adjusts the learning rate for each weight based on the historical gradient information, making it more efficient and effective than SGD in some cases.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot determine if any optimization techniques beyond weight decay and backpropagation were used in the deep learning pipeline for LULC classification.


Based on the provided context, the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for LULC classification include weight decay and backpropagation. However, there is no explicit mention of more advanced optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam.
