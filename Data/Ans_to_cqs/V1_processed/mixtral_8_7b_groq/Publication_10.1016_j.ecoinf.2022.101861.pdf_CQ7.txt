The provided context does not give information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context focuses on the use of Kaleidoscope Pro 5.4.7, an automated signal recognition software, to analyze acoustic data of the Band-tailed Nighthawk. The software extracts sounds of interest based on five parameters, including minimum and maximum signal length, minimum and maximum frequency range, and maximum intersyllable gap. The signal parameters used in the study were 900 and 1500 Hz for minimum and maximum frequency, respectively, and 4 and 30 seconds for minimum and maximum signal length, respectively. The maximum intersyllable gap was set to 4000 ms.

The study characterized 67 songs of the Nighthawk using all recordings uploaded in Xeno-canto and recorded in the State of Mato Grosso. However, the context does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, or validating a deep learning model. It is important to note that data splitting is a crucial step in developing a deep learning model, as it helps to ensure that the model can generalize well to new, unseen data. Common approaches for data splitting include random sampling, k-fold cross-validation, and holdout validation.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
