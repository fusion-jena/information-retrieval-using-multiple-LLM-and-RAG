Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix after the model training. However, it does mention that three models (a simple linear model, a generalized linear model with a gamma distribution, and an artificial neural network) were fitted using a "training dataset" and further validated using a "testing dataset."

For the artificial neural network (ANN) model, the performance was evaluated by calculating the mean deviance of the model response from SPAD value measurements, which was 1.904 (95% CI: 1.89â€“1.92), and the best "run" showed a mean deviation of 1.70 (max. 2.22, 95% CI, one-sided t-test). The GLM approach also achieved significant results, although only slightly better than LM.

It is important to note that the context focuses on the model training, validation, and comparison of their performances. Therefore, it does not discuss any postprocessing steps like saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

In summary, based on the given context, there are no specific postprocessing steps mentioned after the model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The focus of the context is on the model training, validation, and comparison of their performances.
