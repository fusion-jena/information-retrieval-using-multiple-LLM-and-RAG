The provided context does not directly discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the optimization of parameters for a Land Transformation Rate (LTR) model, which can improve the accuracy and kappa of the model.

In the context of remote sensing and geospatial analysis, data bias can occur due to various factors such as the spatial distribution of samples, the quality of data, and the representativeness of the data. To address these biases, several preprocessing techniques can be used, such as:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the data into homogeneous subsets or strata based on certain criteria, such as land cover type or vegetation index. This ensures that each subset has a similar distribution of samples, reducing bias in the training and testing datasets.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of samples from a particular class or group that is underrepresented in the dataset. This can help to balance the dataset and reduce bias.
3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of samples from a particular class or group that is overrepresented in the dataset. This can also help to balance the dataset and reduce bias.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from a variety of sources and locations to ensure that the dataset is representative of the study area. This can help to reduce bias and improve the accuracy of the model.

While the provided context does not mention these specific techniques, it does highlight the importance of selecting the most appropriate index for a given region to improve the accuracy of the LTR algorithm. This suggests that the authors recognize the importance of addressing data bias and ensuring that the model is appropriate for the specific climate and vegetation cover conditions of the study area.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, it does emphasize the importance of selecting appropriate indices and optimizing model parameters to improve accuracy and reduce bias. Other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection can also be used to address data bias during preprocessing.
