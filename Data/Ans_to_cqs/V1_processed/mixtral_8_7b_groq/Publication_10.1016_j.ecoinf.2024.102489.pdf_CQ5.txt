The provided context does not give information about any deep learning pipeline or specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention that Jamali et al. (2023) used deep neural networks for estimating leaf parameters. But it does not specify the dataset used in their study.

The context mainly focuses on the use of high spatial resolution satellite image data for machine learning methods. Specifically, it mentions the MOD09A1 dataset, which is a synthesized dataset from the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) product. The dataset is used for training samples and has been processed to remove cloud-contaminated and poor-quality pixels.

Additionally, the context provides information about other satellite data sources, such as Landsat-8, GF-1, and Sentinel-2A, which have been used for acquiring high spatial resolution satellite images. However, there is no mention of these datasets being used in a deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query about the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline.
