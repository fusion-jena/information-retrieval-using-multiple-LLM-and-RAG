The provided context does not directly mention the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does discuss the creation and utilization of a specific dataset related to forest fires in the Panhandle area of Florida, USA.

First, researchers used Sentinel-2 satellite images and integrated them with a cloud platform. Then, they employed machine learning techniques to classify fire-damaged monuments, achieving success in detecting minor fires. Furthermore, they utilized the platform's cloud computing capabilities to conduct extensive geospatial computations for quantifying carbon emissions from forest fires, considering intricate influencing factors.

To enhance the "ForestFireArea" image collection with Above Ground Biomass (AGB) data, the researchers obtained MODIS projection details and implemented the "ee.reduceResolution()" function. This process averaged the values and rescaled the image resolution to 500 m, resulting in the updated "ForestFireAreawithAGB" image collection. This dataset offers improved overall quality for each individual pixel, increasing its interpretability and reliability for analytical purposes.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly name the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, it does detail the creation and enhancement of a custom dataset focused on forest fires in Florida. This dataset underwent various processing steps, including the integration of machine learning techniques and the incorporation of AGB data, to improve its analytical capabilities and reliability.
