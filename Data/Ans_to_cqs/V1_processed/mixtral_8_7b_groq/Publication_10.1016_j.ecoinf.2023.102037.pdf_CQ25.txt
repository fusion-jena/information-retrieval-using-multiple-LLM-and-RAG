The purpose of the deep learning model in the given context is object detection, specifically for insect detection. This is evident in the use of the YOLOv5 model, which is known for its object detection capabilities. Furthermore, the model is designed to improve detection and classification accuracy in the COCO dataset, a popular object detection benchmarking dataset. The model backbone, CSPNet, is used to enhance the learning capability of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), while a Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) layer and a path aggregation network (PANet) are used to boost information flow. The head in YOLOv5 achieves multi-scale prediction by generating different output feature maps. Therefore, the deep learning model is primarily used for insect object detection in this context.
