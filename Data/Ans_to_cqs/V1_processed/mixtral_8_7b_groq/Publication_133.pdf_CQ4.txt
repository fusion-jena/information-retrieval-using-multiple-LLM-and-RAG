In the context provided, there is no explicit mention of the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, data augmentation is a common technique used in deep learning to increase the amount and diversity of training data, improve model performance, and prevent overfitting.

Data augmentation techniques typically include flipping, rotating, scaling, and other transformations that generate new training samples by applying various modifications to the existing ones. These techniques can help the model generalize better and become more robust to variations in the input data.

For instance, in the study "Deep Learning for Insect Ecoinformatics" by Gerovichev et al., the authors use a deep learning model called YOLO (You Only Look Once) to identify and classify insects in images. While the study does not explicitly mention data augmentation techniques, it is likely that they were applied to increase the diversity of the training data and improve the model's performance.

Common data augmentation techniques for image data include:

1. Flipping: Horizontal or vertical flipping of the images, which can help the model become more robust to changes in orientation.
2. Rotating: Rotating the images by a certain angle, which can help the model generalize better to objects with different orientations.
3. Scaling: Changing the size of the images, which can help the model handle objects of different scales.
4. Translation: Shifting the images horizontally or vertically, which can help the model become more robust to changes in position.
5. Color jittering: Changing the brightness, contrast, or hue of the images, which can help the model handle images with different lighting conditions.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, these techniques are commonly applied to improve model performance, prevent overfitting, and increase the diversity of the training data.
