The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of specific evaluation metrics and a validation dataset. Although the specific details of this validation strategy are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, we can infer some aspects of it.

First, the model's performance is measured using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and a percentile value, which are calculated for both the training and testing datasets. The MAE is a common metric for regression problems, and the percentile value could be an additional measure of dispersion or accuracy. These metrics are useful for understanding the model's performance and identifying potential overfitting or underfitting issues.

Second, the context indicates that a portion of the dataset is used for testing, and the real and predicted values of thermocline presence are plotted in Figure 6. This visualization allows for a more intuitive understanding of the model's performance, particularly in terms of how well it captures the stratification of the reservoir.

Third, the training process includes the use of an early stopping mechanism, which is implicitly suggested by the mention of different epoch numbers in Table 4. By trying various epoch numbers, the trainers likely aimed to find the best balance between model accuracy and computational cost. This approach helps prevent overfitting and reduces the training time.

In summary, the strategy for monitoring the model performance during training includes the use of evaluation metrics (MAE and percentile), visualization of predictions, and early stopping based on the model's performance during training.
