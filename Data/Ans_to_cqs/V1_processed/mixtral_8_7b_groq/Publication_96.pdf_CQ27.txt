The process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model involved using graphics processing units (GPUs) and specialized hardware components for running parallel arithmetic operations in the Google Cloud suite of cloud Platform. The deep learning methods required a powerful computational processing, which was facilitated by the Google Cloud environment. The trained deep neural network models were developed using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) satellite images and spectral training samples of burned and non-burned areas. After training the models, the prediction was made for the entire study area, followed by model assessment, validation, and concordance analysis. The fire hotspot data analysis indicated that most of the fire events in the Cerrado biome occurred between May and December, with a peak in September 2017. Therefore, the mapping analysis of burn scars was focused on this period, which comprised 98% of fire hotspots detected in 2017. However, the context does not provide specific details on model serialization or platform selection. It can be inferred that the model was deployed and run on the Google Cloud Platform, but the specifics of how the model was serialized or deployed are not provided.
