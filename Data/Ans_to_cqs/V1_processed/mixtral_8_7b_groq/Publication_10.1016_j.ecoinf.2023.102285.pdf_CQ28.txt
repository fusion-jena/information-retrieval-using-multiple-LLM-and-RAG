The provided context does not explicitly mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The text only mentions that the model was constructed using various datasets and was tested, evaluated, and validated (Figure 3 in the context). The model's architecture is based on the HSV color space (Figure 4), and it uses a Gaussian function for data distribution (Figure 5).

The context also mentions that the deep learning model was developed using supervised approaches and aims to be incorporated with camera systems in aeroplanes and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for real-time rescue missions on high seas and open oceans. However, it does not specify the cloud platform used for deployment.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
