The context does not provide specific information on the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions that the most suitable architecture was chosen based on the best validation accuracy and precision obtained during training. This suggests that the training process likely involved monitoring the performance on a validation dataset and stopping the training when a certain level of performance was achieved or when there were no significant improvements for a certain number of iterations. The specific criteria used for determining training completion could be based on various factors such as validation loss, accuracy, or precision plateauing or reaching a predefined threshold. Nonetheless, the exact criteria were not specified in the provided context.
