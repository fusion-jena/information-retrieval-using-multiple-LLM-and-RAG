Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The context includes details about the training process, such as the use of GPU Tesla T4, CUDA Version-12.0, Google Colab, input image size, batch size, epochs, weights, custom data set, and cache. It also describes the dataset used, which is publicly available on Roboflow and named Animal2-v1, consisting of 9952 images belonging to different classes. The preprocessing applied to the dataset and the integration of the SENet attention mechanism with the YOLOv5 architecture are also mentioned. However, there is no information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline.
