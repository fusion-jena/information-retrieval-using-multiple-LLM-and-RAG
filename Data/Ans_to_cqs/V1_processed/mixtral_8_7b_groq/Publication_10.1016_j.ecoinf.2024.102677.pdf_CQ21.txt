Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. However, it does mention that the performance of the models was evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores. It also mentions that the ResNet50 model was selected because it had the best values for these metrics among the five networks. Therefore, it can be inferred that the postprocessing steps likely included the calculation of these metrics. However, there is no information to confirm the use of other postprocessing techniques like saliency maps or confusion matrix.
