The provided context does not mention any specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does discuss the use of remote sensing images from the Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) for mangrove pattern monitoring. These images were obtained from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform and were used to construct a dataset of long-term images for a study area with few clouds. The images were selected from June to September in each typical year (1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020) and were processed to generate cloud-free images in each typical year for the study area. These images were then used to analyze the temporal dynamics of mangrove spatial distribution in the study area.

Additionally, the study by Lassalle et al. (2022) used very-high-resolution satellite imagery to delineate individual tree crowns in mangrove forests using a deep learning-based approach. However, the specific dataset used in this study is not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, while the context provides information on the use of remote sensing images for mangrove pattern monitoring and individual tree crown delineation, it does not mention any specific deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
