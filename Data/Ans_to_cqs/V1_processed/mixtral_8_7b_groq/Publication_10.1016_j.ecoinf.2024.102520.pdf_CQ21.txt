Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps after model training specifically for the model mentioned are not explicitly stated. The context focuses on image acquisition, processing, and the use of kriging variance in the model training process. However, I can provide some general postprocessing steps that are commonly used in model training:

 In the context of machine learning model training, postprocessing steps typically involve the evaluation of the model's performance. Here are some common postprocessing steps:

1. **Calculation of Metrics**: This involves the computation of various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and mean squared error (MSE) to assess the model's performance. In the provided context, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of residuals is mentioned, which is one such metric.

2. **Generation of Saliency Maps**: Saliency maps are used to visualize the areas of the input that the model is focusing on for making predictions. This can be useful in understanding the decision-making process of the model. However, the provided context does not mention the use of saliency maps.

3. **Creation of Confusion Matrices**: A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model. It can show the number of false positives, false negatives, true positives, and true negatives. The context does not mention the use of a confusion matrix.

4. **Visualization**: This involves plotting the predictions and actual values to visually assess the model's performance. The context mentions 'Visualization' under the roles and responsibilities, but it does not specify if it's related to postprocessing.

5. **Validation**: This step involves checking the model's performance on a separate validation set to ensure that the model is not overfitting the training data. The context mentions 'Validation' under the roles and responsibilities, but it does not specify if it's related to postprocessing.

Given the context, it seems like the focus is more on the image acquisition, processing, and the model training process rather than the postprocessing steps.
