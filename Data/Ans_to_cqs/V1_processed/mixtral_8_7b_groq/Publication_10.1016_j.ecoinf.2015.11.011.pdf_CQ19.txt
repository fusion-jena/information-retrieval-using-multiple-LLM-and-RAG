Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of which specific deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, are used for building the model. However, it is mentioned that machine learning techniques are being used in conjunction with segmentation for image classification. It is also noted that some level of supervision and validation is still necessary, even with machine learning techniques.

It is possible that the authors used one of the popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, but it is not specified in the text. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question.
