Unfortunately, there is no information provided in the given pieces of context about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The articles mention the use of Google Earth Engine for processing and analyzing satellite images, as well as the application of deep learning techniques for detecting artisanal small-scale mining and mapping large-scale mines. However, they do not specify where the code for these processes is hosted.

It is possible that the authors have not made the code publicly available or that it is stored in a different repository not mentioned in the context. If you are interested in the specific code used in the study, it may be best to contact the authors directly for more information.
