The provided context does not give information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete for a specific model or machine learning algorithm. The text focuses on the description of the Apis-FIS model, its inputs, outputs, and membership functions, as well as a comparison between the Apis-FIS prediction and field estimation from the validation.

In the context, the authors mention that they performed an analysis to explain the potential difference between their Apis-FIS prediction and the field estimation from the validation. However, they do not mention any specific criteria used to determine when the training of their model is complete.

In general, when training a machine learning model, one common criterion used to determine when training is complete is when the validation loss plateaus or stops decreasing significantly. This means that the model's performance on a validation set stops improving, indicating that the model has likely learned the underlying patterns in the training data and is not overfitting.

Other criteria that can be used to determine when training is complete include early stopping, where training is stopped when the model's performance on a validation set starts to degrade, or monitoring other metrics such as accuracy or precision.

In summary, while the provided context does not give information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the Apis-FIS model, in general, validation loss plateauing, early stopping, and monitoring other metrics are common criteria used to determine when training is complete for machine learning models.
