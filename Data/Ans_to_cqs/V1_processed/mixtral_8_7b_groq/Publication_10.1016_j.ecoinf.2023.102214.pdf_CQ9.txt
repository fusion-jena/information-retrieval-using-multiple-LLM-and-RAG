The data repository for the deep learning pipeline is Whiskerbook.org, as stated in the context. It is a specialized data repository for snow leopard data used in this study. This platform is where the largest fully labeled snow leopard dataset for deep learning research is contributed. Whiskerbook.org encourages other academics to contribute more datasets to enhance the data used to improve the deep learning pipeline.
