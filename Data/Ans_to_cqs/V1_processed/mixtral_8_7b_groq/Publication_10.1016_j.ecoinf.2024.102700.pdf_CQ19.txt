Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the use of deep learning models in the described study. The study focuses on the examination of various modelling approaches used in scientific literature related to the topic, but it does not mention any specific deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.

The study does discuss several modelling approaches, including regression-based methods, machine learning techniques, distance-based/envelope models, point process models, ensemble approaches, and other methods. However, these categories are broad and do not necessarily imply the use of deep learning.

Moreover, the study specifically mentions some machine learning models, such as Generalised Additive models, Generalised linear models, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines, Maximum Entropy model, Random Forest, Boosted Regression Trees, Generalised Boosted Models, Artificial Neural Networks, Classification and Regression Trees, Flexible Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machine, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Bipartite Network modelling, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, and Ecological Niche Factor Analysis. Again, while some of these models can be used in deep learning, the context does not indicate that they are being used as part of a deep learning framework.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query regarding the use of deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
