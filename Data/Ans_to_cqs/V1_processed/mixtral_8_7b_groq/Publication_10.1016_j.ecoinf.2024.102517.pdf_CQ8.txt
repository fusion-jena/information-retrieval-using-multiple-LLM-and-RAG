The provided context does not give information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available, such as on GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. The text focuses on the description of the experimental setting, comparative algorithms, and the performance of the deep feature loss-based bird sound noise reduction network. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
