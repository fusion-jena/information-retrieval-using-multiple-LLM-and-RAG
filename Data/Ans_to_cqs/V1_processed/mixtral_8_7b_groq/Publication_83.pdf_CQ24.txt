Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as using a random seed value. However, there are details about the deep learning architecture and data preprocessing methods used in the study.

The deep learning architecture, SubSpectralNet, is used to classify bird sounds. To improve classification performance, selected deep learning models are fused, achieving a balanced accuracy of 86.31% and a weighted F1-score of 93.31%. The feature learning part of the model follows a VGG style network, which is trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 10âˆ’4. The categorical cross entropy is utilized as the loss function, and the network is trained with a batch size of 64 samples for 200 epochs.

In terms of data preprocessing, two methods are used to handle the varying length of audio files in the CLO-43DS data. The first method involves repeating the signal from the beginning to force a fixed duration of 2s. The second method directly resizes the audio image to a fixed size. These methods aim to make the data compatible with the deep learning architecture, but they do not specifically address randomness in the pipeline.

In summary, while the text provides details about the deep learning architecture and data preprocessing methods used in the study, it does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as using a random seed value.
