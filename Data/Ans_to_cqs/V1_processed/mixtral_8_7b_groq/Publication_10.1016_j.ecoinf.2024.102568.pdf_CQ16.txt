Based on the information provided, there are no specific criteria mentioned for determining when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The context focuses on the comparison of the performance of different models and methods, rather than the training process itself.

In Experiment 1 (Exp.1), a table is presented with results of RMSE, MAE, and MRE for a two-month training period. However, it does not specify how the training period was determined. The table only mentions that the training period was four weeks long.

Experiment 3 (Exp.3) introduces a longer training period for the baseline model, but again, there is no information on how the training duration or completion was decided.

The context also discusses the performance of various models, such as VR + SVR and LSTM, compared to a baseline and other models. These comparisons are made in terms of RMSE, MAE, and MRE reduction, without mentioning the specific training completion criteria.
