The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the context where it mentions a "deep convolutional neural network for background subtraction" (Babaee, Dinh, & Rigoll, 2017). Furthermore, the model is trained using feature vectors extracted from the fixed inception layers, which is a common technique in CNNs. The model is used for classification of hummingbird visitation events in time-lapse camera data.
