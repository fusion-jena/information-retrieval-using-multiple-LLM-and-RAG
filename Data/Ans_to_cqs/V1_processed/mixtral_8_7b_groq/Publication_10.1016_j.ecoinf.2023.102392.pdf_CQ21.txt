Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix after model training. However, the context does provide information about the use of UAV data processing and the evaluation of model accuracy in a land use/land cover classification study using XGBoost.

In the UAV data processing, the steps include camera parameter correction, setting up connection points, point fine-tuning, and editing ground control points. These steps are focused on correcting image distortions, identifying overlapping areas between images, and georeferencing the dataset to the WGS84/UTM coordinate system.

In the evaluation of model accuracy, the study used XGBoost for land use/land cover classification and reported LULC accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and kappa statistics for the years 2005 and 2022. Additionally, the study reported the accuracy of forest types in the study site using XGBoost with precision, recall, F1 score, and overall accuracy.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix, it does provide information about the use of UAV data processing and the evaluation of model accuracy in a land use/land cover classification study using XGBoost.
