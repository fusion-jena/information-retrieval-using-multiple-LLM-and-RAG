I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The text mentions the use of C# language within Microsoft’s.NET Framework and integration into Rhino’s plugin ecosystem, but it does not specify the exact location of the code repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide the requested link to GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
