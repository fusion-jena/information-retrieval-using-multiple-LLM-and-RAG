The provided context does not directly discuss data bias techniques in the context of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does provide some information on data analysis that can be used to infer some preprocessing techniques.

In the table provided, we can observe that certain song variants have a higher number of tracks and a higher percentage of tracking samples compared to others. This imbalance in the data could potentially lead to data bias and affect the performance of a deep learning model.

To address data bias, several techniques can be employed during the preprocessing stage of the deep learning pipeline. These techniques include:

1. Stratified sampling: Stratified sampling is a method of sampling that ensures each stratum or subset of the population is proportionally represented in the sample. In the context of the table provided, stratified sampling could be used to ensure that each song variant is represented in the training, validation, and testing sets in proportion to its occurrence in the population.
2. Oversampling: Oversampling is a technique used to increase the number of instances of the minority class in the dataset. In the context of the table provided, oversampling could be used to increase the number of tracks for the song variants that have a lower number of tracks.
3. Undersampling: Undersampling is a technique used to decrease the number of instances of the majority class in the dataset. In the context of the table provided, undersampling could be used to decrease the number of tracks for the song variants that have a higher number of tracks.
4. Diverse data collection: Diverse data collection involves gathering data from a variety of sources to ensure that the dataset is representative of the population. In the context of the table provided, diverse data collection could involve gathering data from different geographical locations or different recording devices to ensure that the dataset is not biased towards a particular subset of the population.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not directly discuss data bias techniques in the context of a deep learning pipeline, it does provide some information on data analysis that can be used to infer some preprocessing techniques. Techniques such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection can be employed during the preprocessing stage of the deep learning pipeline to address data bias.
