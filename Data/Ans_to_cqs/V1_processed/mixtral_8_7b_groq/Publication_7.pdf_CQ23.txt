The text provided does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model in terms of diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention some steps that could indirectly contribute to the model's generalizability.

Firstly, the model uses image representations extracted from a deep neural network that was trained on a large dataset, ImageNet, which contains 1.2 million images and 1000 classes. This initial training on a diverse dataset could help the model learn a wide range of features that can be useful for generalizing to new data.

Secondly, the model's first fully connected layer weights are fine-tuned using the Benthoz15 dataset, which consists of expert-annotated and geo-referenced marine images from Australian seas. This dataset is further divided into a Western Australia (WA) subset containing 4,750 images with 237,500 expert-annotated points. Using a domain-specific dataset for fine-tuning could help the model adapt to the specific characteristics of the data it will be used on, improving its ability to generalize.

Lastly, the text mentions that they applied color channel stretch on each image in the dataset. This pre-processing step involves calculating the 1% and 99% intensity percentiles for each color channel, and then normalizing the intensities. This could help to reduce the effect of outliers and make the model more robust to variations in the data, which could indirectly contribute to its generalizability.

However, it is important to note that these measures do not explicitly ensure the generalizability of the model. Other techniques such as cross-validation, stratified splitting, or using a diverse dataset for the final training could provide additional assurance of the model's ability to generalize.
