Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. However, the context does provide information about the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the models, which can be considered as a part of the postprocessing step.

The evaluation metrics used in the context include R-squared (R2), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and the Erdas Delta Geometric Accuracy (ERGAS). These metrics are commonly used to evaluate the performance of regression and image reconstruction models.

R-squared (R2) is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance for a dependent variable that's explained by an independent variable or variables in a regression model. MAE measures the average magnitude of the errors between the fused results and observed values, while RMSE measures the standard deviation of the prediction errors. ERGAS calculates the quality of the fused image as the normalized average error of the fused image bands, which can be used to assess the accuracy of image reconstruction and the smoothness in preserving the spatial resolution.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after model training include the calculation of evaluation metrics such as R2, MAE, RMSE, and ERGAS. However, there is no information about other postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrix.
