Based on the provided context, there is no information about any optimization techniques being applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the use of forward feature selection (FFS) in the context of logistic regression and random forest models for classification tasks. It describes the process of selecting features using random cross-validation (CV) and spatial CV, and repeating the procedure over 100 random blocking configurations. The context also describes the use of the random forest algorithm, which is a type of ensemble learning method that uses decision trees.

However, the context does not mention any deep learning techniques or optimization methods such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam. Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query about optimization techniques in the deep learning pipeline.
