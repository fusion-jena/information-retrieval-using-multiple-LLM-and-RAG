I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include information about the code repository for the BirdNET deep learning pipeline. The text describes the overall process, methods, and design of the BirdNET system, but it does not mention where the corresponding code is hosted. Therefore, I am unable to provide a specific GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket link for the pipeline's code. You may need to contact the authors or the Cornell Lab of Ornithology for more information on the code repository.
