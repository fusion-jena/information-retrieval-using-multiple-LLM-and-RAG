The provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of a bird image dataset for training deep learning models for image-based species classification of protected Indonesian birds. Therefore, it can be inferred that the raw data for this particular application was collected through image data, possibly using methods such as cameras or other imaging devices.

In general, raw data for deep learning pipelines can be collected through various methods, including but not limited to:

1. Surveys: Surveys can be used to collect data in the form of responses from participants. For example, in the context of natural language processing, surveys can be used to collect text data from respondents.
2. Sensors: Sensors can be used to collect data in the form of measurements from the environment. For example, in the context of computer vision, sensors such as cameras can be used to collect image data.
3. Public datasets: Publicly available datasets can be used as raw data for deep learning pipelines. These datasets can be obtained from various sources, such as research institutions, government agencies, or online repositories.

It is important to note that the choice of data collection method depends on the specific task and application of the deep learning pipeline. The context provided does not give enough information to determine the exact method used for collecting raw data in this particular case.
