The specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model for detecting artisanal small-scale mining in Ghana are producer accuracy and user accuracy, which are components of the overall accuracy. These metrics are used to assess the performance of the model in classifying various land cover types, including water, forest, bare soil, mining, and urban areas.

In the study, the overall accuracy of the map was calculated as the percentage of correctly classified pixels out of the total number of pixels. The producer accuracy, also known as commission error, measures the proportion of actual pixels of a certain class that are correctly identified by the model. The user accuracy, also known as omission error, measures the proportion of predicted pixels of a certain class that are actually present in the ground truth data.

The study reported the overall accuracy of the map as increasing from 84% to 91% due to the improvement in urban and mining accuracy. Specifically, the mining accuracy increased from 84% to 88% for the producer accuracy and from 84% to 86% for the user accuracy. Similarly, the urban accuracy increased from 84% to 86% for the producer accuracy and from 84% to 89% for the user accuracy.

It is worth noting that the study did not explicitly mention other metrics such as precision, recall, or F1 score. However, these metrics can also be used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. Precision measures the proportion of true positives among the predicted positives, while recall measures the proportion of true positives among the actual positives. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of both.

In summary, the study used producer accuracy and user accuracy to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model for detecting artisanal small-scale mining in Ghana. These metrics were used to assess the model's performance in classifying various land cover types, including water, forest, bare soil, mining, and urban areas. Other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score can also be used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model.
