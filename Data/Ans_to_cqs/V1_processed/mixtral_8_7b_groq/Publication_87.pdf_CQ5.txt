The specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline described in the given context are not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that the dataset used consists of images of a Eurasian lynx and its two main preys.

The text mentions that the pipeline involves training a deep learning model for image recognition using a dataset of labeled images, and then using the trained model to make predictions on a new dataset of unlabelled images. The model used for this pipeline is a Resnet18 or Resnet50, which are commonly used architectures for image recognition tasks.

The dataset used in this case study is likely to be a curated and labeled dataset of images of the Eurasian lynx and its preys, collected using camera traps. The collection of images using camera traps is mentioned in the text, and the use of a curated and labeled dataset is implied by the description of the deep learning pipeline.

It's also important to note that the authors mention other well-known datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet in the text, but they are not mentioned as being used in this specific pipeline. These datasets are commonly used for image recognition tasks in deep learning, but the authors chose to use a different dataset for their case study.
