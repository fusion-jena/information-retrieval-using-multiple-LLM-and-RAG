The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images. The study "Recognition of Endemic Bird Species Using Deep Learning Models" by Y.-P. Huang and H. Basanta focuses on recognizing endemic bird species using deep learning models. They used a dataset of bird images, which were split into training, validation, and testing datasets. The training dataset consisted of 3,132 images, which were augmented 10 times to have a total of 31,320 images. Out of these, 25,056 images were used for training, and 6,264 images were used for validation. The testing dataset consisted of 760 images, which were excluded from the training and validation datasets. Therefore, the data format used in this deep learning pipeline is images.
