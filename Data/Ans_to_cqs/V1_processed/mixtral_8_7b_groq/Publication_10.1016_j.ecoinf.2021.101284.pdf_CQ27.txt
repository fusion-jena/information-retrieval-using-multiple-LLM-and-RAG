Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model. The text focuses on discussing the use of machine learning and statistical methods for analyzing air pollution data and its relationship with COVID-19 cases. It also mentions the use of a deep learning algorithm for early diagnosis of COVID-19 patients based on X-ray and computed tomography images in a separate study.

However, there are some general practices that are typically followed to deploy a trained deep learning model, which can be inferred from the context:

1. Model serialization: This involves saving the trained model's architecture, weights, and biases to a file, allowing it to be reloaded and used for inference at a later time. The context does not explicitly mention model serialization, but it is a common practice in deep learning model deployment.
2. Platform selection: This involves choosing a suitable platform for deploying the deep learning model, such as a web application, mobile application, or embedded device. The context does not provide information on the platform used for deploying the deep learning model.

In summary, while the provided context does not contain specific information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, it is possible to infer that the typical practices of model serialization and platform selection were likely employed.
