The text provided does not give explicit information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Deep Learning, and the need to avoid overfitting due to the limited size of the annotated training data. Common regularization methods for CNNs include L2 regularization, dropout, and data augmentation. Therefore, it is possible that one or more of these methods were used in the pipeline, but further information is needed to confirm this.

The pipeline was built using Python, Theano, Lasagne, and librosa for audio processing. The CNN classifier consisted of a series of layers that modified input data with mathematical operations optimized to improve classification performance. However, the specific parameters and settings of the CNN, including any regularization methods used, are not provided in the text.

In addition, the text mentions the importance of normalization strategies for the input data. Different normalization strategies were applied, but the specific methods used are not specified. While normalization is not a regularization method per se, it can help improve the performance and generalization of CNNs by reducing internal covariate shift.

Overall, while the text suggests that regularization methods were likely used in the deep learning pipeline to prevent overfitting, the specific methods are not mentioned.
