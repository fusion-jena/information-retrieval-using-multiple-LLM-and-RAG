The text provided does not give explicit information about which specific deep learning framework was used to build the model. However, it does mention that TensorBoard was used to monitor and validate the experiments, which suggests that TensorFlow was used as TensorBoard is a tool provided by the TensorFlow library for visualizing training metrics. It is important to note that this is only an inference, and the specific deep learning framework used is not explicitly stated in the text.
