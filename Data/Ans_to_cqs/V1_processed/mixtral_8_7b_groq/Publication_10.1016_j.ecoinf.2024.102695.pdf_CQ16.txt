The context provided does not explicitly mention the specific criterion used to determine when the training process is complete. However, it does mention the use of an early stopping strategy. This strategy typically involves setting a threshold for a metric, such as validation loss, and stopping the training process if this metric does not improve for a certain number of epochs. This helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the model generalizes well to unseen data. Therefore, it can be inferred that the training process likely stops when the validation loss plateaus or stops improving for a certain number of epochs.
