The text provided discusses various aspects of machine learning and deep learning, including different fusion methods, but it does not explicitly mention the use of dropout or L2 regularization as methods to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention data augmentation as a technique used to increase the size and variability of the dataset, which is a common method to prevent overfitting.

To answer the query, I will provide some background information on dropout and L2 regularization, which are both regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting in deep learning models.

Dropout is a regularization technique used during training to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping out, or "turning off", a proportion of the neurons in a layer of the neural network. This helps to break up co-adaptations between neurons, which can lead to overfitting. The dropped-out neurons are not included in the forward pass or the backward pass of backpropagation, and their weights are not updated during that iteration of training. The proportion of neurons to drop out is a hyperparameter that can be tuned for the specific problem.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is a method that adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. This encourages the weights to be small, which can help to prevent overfitting. The strength of the regularization is controlled by a hyperparameter, which determines the weight of the penalty term.

In summary, while the provided text does not explicitly mention dropout or L2 regularization, these are both common regularization techniques used in deep learning to prevent overfitting. Data augmentation is also mentioned as a method used to increase the size and variability of the dataset, which can help to prevent overfitting.
