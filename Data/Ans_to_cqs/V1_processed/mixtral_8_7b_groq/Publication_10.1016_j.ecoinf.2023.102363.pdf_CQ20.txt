The deep learning model was trained using the Tesla K80 GPU, which is a type of graphics processing unit (GPU). GPUs are specialized hardware designed to accelerate computations that are common in machine learning tasks, such as matrix multiplications. By using GPUs, the training process can be significantly sped up compared to using only a central processing unit (CPU). The Tesla K80 GPU was accessed through cloud computing on the Google Colaboratory (Colab) platform.

In summary, the deep learning model was trained using the Tesla K80 GPU, which is a type of hardware specifically designed to accelerate machine learning tasks. The GPU was accessed through the Google Colaboratory platform and was used to train the model on the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001, decay factor of 0.75, and step size of E.L. White et al. (Fig.  1).
