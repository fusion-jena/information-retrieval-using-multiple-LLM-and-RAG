The provided context does not give specific criteria used to determine when training is complete for the CNN model used in the study. However, it does mention that validation soundscape data was used to improve performance, indicating that validation loss or other validation metrics may have been monitored during training. Common criteria for determining training completion include a validation loss plateau, where the loss on a validation set stops decreasing even if training loss continues to decrease, or a minimum validation loss threshold. It is also possible that early stopping was used to prevent overfitting, where training is stopped when validation loss starts to increase. The context does not provide enough information to determine which of these criteria, if any, were used.
