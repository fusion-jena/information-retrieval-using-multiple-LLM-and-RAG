The provided context discusses the implementation and optimization of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model, a U-Net model, and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for remote sensing image classification. However, it does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.

That being said, there are some implicit indications that the authors may have addressed data bias in their methodology. For instance, they mention that the U-Net model was implemented within the arcgis.learn module of the ArcGIS API for Python, which "reduces the time and resources spent on ground truth data collection" (2.3). This suggests that the authors may have used a pre-trained model or transferred learning, which can help reduce data bias by incorporating knowledge from a diverse range of data.

Furthermore, the authors mention that they used a confusion/error matrix and subsequent metrics to compare the accuracy of various models (2.7). This is a good practice for evaluating model performance, as it can help identify any systematic biases or errors in the model's predictions.

In general, there are several techniques that can be used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. These include:

1. Stratified splitting: This involves dividing the data into training and testing sets in a way that ensures each set has a similar distribution of classes. This can help prevent bias towards the majority class.
2. Oversampling: This involves increasing the number of instances of the minority class in the training set. This can help prevent bias towards the majority class, but can also lead to overfitting.
3. Undersampling: This involves decreasing the number of instances of the majority class in the training set. This can help prevent bias towards the majority class, but can also lead to underfitting.
4. Diverse data collection: This involves collecting data from a wide range of sources and ensuring that it is representative of the population. This can help prevent bias towards any particular class or source.

Without more information about the specific methodology used in the study, it is difficult to say for sure whether these techniques were used. However, the authors' attention to model evaluation and the use of pre-trained models suggest that they may have taken steps to address data bias.
