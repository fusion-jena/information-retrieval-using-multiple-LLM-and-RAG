The provided context does not give specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) and multispectral data in the process of carbon sequestration quantification and estimation of carbon stocks.

Uniyal et al., (2022) used Landsat 8 OLI data for quantification of carbon sequestration by urban forest using machine learning algorithms in Jodhpur, India. Similarly, Dube & Mutanga (2015) evaluated the utility of the medium-spatial resolution Landsat 8 multispectral sensor in quantifying aboveground biomass in uMgeni catchment, South Africa.

Additionally, Domingues et al., (2020) used integrated multispectral and SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data for high-performance prediction of eucalyptus biomass. This suggests that remote sensing data, specifically multispectral and SAR data, are used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.

Furthermore, the context mentions the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and gradient boosting for processing and analyzing the collected data. ANNs are a type of deep learning algorithm that can learn patterns and relationships from large datasets. Gradient boosting is a machine learning technique used for regression and classification tasks, which involves iteratively training models and adjusting their weights to improve accuracy.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it does suggest the use of remote sensing data, specifically multispectral and SAR data. These data are likely collected through sensors mounted on satellites or other aerial platforms. Once collected, the data are processed and analyzed using deep learning algorithms such as ANNs and gradient boosting.
