The performance of the deep learning model for species distribution is evaluated using the Area Under the receiver-operator Curve (AUC) and the True Skill Statistics (TSS). The AUC values range from 0 to 1, with values closer to 1 indicating a higher accuracy of model prediction. A TSS value of +1 means complete agreement between observed and predicted distributions, whereas values of ≤0 denote no better than random performance. These methods are commonly used to assess the model performance in species distribution model studies. The model's performance is classified as poor, medium, or good based on the AUC values of 0-0.335, 0.336-0.665, and 0.666-1, respectively. Additionally, the model with the lowest AICc value (i.e. ΔAICc = 0) is considered the best model out of the current suite of models, and all models with ΔAICc <2 are generally considered to have substantial support.
