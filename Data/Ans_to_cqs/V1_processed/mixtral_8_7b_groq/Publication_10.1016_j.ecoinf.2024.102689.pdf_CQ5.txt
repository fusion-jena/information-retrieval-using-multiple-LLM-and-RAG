The provided context does not mention the use of standard datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet in the deep learning pipelines for animal individual recognition. Instead, researchers have developed specific datasets for their studies.

For instance, Lahiri et al. (2011) created a biometric animal database from field photographs to identify individual zebras in the wild. Similarly, Ferreira et al. (2020) developed a program to gather training data and generate a dataset called Arcface_Mask for small bird individual recognition. In underwater environments, researchers have used audio data and images for fish recognition (Laplante et al., 2021) and developed an underwater target detection algorithm based on an improved YOLOv5 model (Lei et al., 2022).

Moreover, researchers have focused on high-resolution monitoring of fish length and catch numbers from landings using deep learning (Kynkäänniemi et al., 2020) and a method with coarse and fine-grained feature linkage learning for precision aquaculture (Aquaculture Research, 2023). In the context of underwater fish individual recognition, Zhang et al. (2021) used an improved YOLOv4 and FaceNet model.

In summary, the provided context does not mention the use of standard datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, researchers have developed custom datasets for their specific studies in animal individual recognition, such as zebra, bird, and fish datasets.
