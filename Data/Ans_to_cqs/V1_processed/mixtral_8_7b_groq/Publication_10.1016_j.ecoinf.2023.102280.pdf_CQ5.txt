The provided context does not give specific details about the datasets used in deep learning-based denoising for bioacoustic applications. However, it mentions that most deep-noise reduction methods focus on NLP applications and are optimized for bandwidths ranging from 16 to 22 kHz. It also highlights the challenge of developing large-scale datasets in bioacoustics due to the sparsity of vocalisations.

In general, the choice of dataset in deep learning depends on the specific task and domain. For image classification, popular datasets include MNIST (handwritten digits), CIFAR (objects), and ImageNet (various objects and scenes). For NLP, datasets often consist of text corpora, such as the Wikipedia dataset used by Defossez et al. (2020) for speech enhancement.

In the context of bioacoustic denoising, the zenodo.3243139 dataset is mentioned, but its specific contents are not described. Sainburg et al. (2020) discuss a dataset of animal vocal repertoires, and Stowell (2021) mentions the challenge of creating large-scale datasets in bioacoustics. However, these do not provide a comprehensive answer to the question.

Therefore, while specific datasets used in deep learning-based denoising for bioacoustic applications are not explicitly provided in the context, it is common in deep learning to use existing datasets specific to the task and domain. In this case, researchers might use their own bioacoustic datasets for denoising, possibly in combination with more general datasets from related domains like NLP or image processing.
