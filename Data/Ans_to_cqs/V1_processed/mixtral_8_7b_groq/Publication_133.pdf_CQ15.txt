The specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the deep learning model's parameters are modified according to the loss function's gradient during the training process. This implies that some form of gradient-based optimization technique is being used.

Common gradient-based optimization techniques used in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad. SGD is a simple optimization algorithm that updates the model's parameters in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function. Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad are more sophisticated optimization algorithms that adapt the learning rate for each parameter based on the historical gradient information, which can result in faster convergence and better performance.

Given that the study used an open-source implementation of YOLO version 5, it is likely that one of these optimization techniques was used. According to the YOLOv5 GitHub repository (<https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/tree/v4.0>), the default optimization algorithm used in YOLOv5 is Adam with a learning rate of 0.001. Therefore, it can be inferred that the study likely used the Adam optimization algorithm in their deep learning pipeline.
