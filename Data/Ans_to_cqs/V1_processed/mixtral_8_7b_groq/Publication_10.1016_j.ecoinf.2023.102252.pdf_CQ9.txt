The provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The article discusses the development of a floodplain ecological response model for large-scale, data-sparse riparian environments. However, it does not mention where the data used in the study is stored or shared. The keywords of the article are Environmental flow, Riparian ecosystem, Wetland, and Biodiversity maintenance, and it focuses on the drought that occurred in the mid-90s and ended in late 2010.

The authors of the article are from CSIRO Environment, Institute for Water Futures, Australian National University, Australian Institute of Marine Science, Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water, and Department of Climate Change. The article is published in the Ecological Informatics journal, which is available at ScienceDirect.

In summary, while the article provides information on the development of a computationally efficient floodplain ecological response model, it does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study.
