Deep learning models, like other machine learning algorithms, can be affected by randomness in the pipeline, which includes factors such as the random seed value. Several strategies are employed to handle this randomness and ensure the robustness and reproducibility of the models.

One such strategy is the use of fixed random seeds. By setting a fixed seed value, the random number generator used in the model initialization, data shuffling, and weight initialization is initialized in a deterministic way, ensuring that the same sequence of random numbers is generated every time the model is run. This helps in reproducing the same results across multiple runs of the model.

Another strategy is the use of cross-validation. Cross-validation is a technique used to assess the performance and generalization ability of a model by dividing the dataset into multiple folds, training the model on different subsets of the data, and evaluating its performance on the remaining portions. This technique helps in reducing the impact of randomness by averaging the performance over multiple runs of the model.

In the context of species distribution modeling, such as in the study "On the selection and effectiveness of pseudo-absences for species distribution modeling with deep learning" by Zbinden et al. (2023), the use of random seeds and cross-validation is crucial for ensuring the robustness and reproducibility of the models. The study averages the performance of the model over 10 random seeds, which helps in reducing the impact of randomness and providing a more reliable estimate of the model's performance.

Furthermore, the use of regularization techniques, such as dropout, helps in reducing overfitting and improving the generalization ability of the model. Dropout, as described in the study by Srivastava et al. (2014), randomly drops out a fraction of the hidden units in the model during training, which helps in preventing the co-adaptation of the units and improving the robustness of the model.

In conclusion, several strategies are employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, including the use of fixed random seeds, cross-validation, and regularization techniques such as dropout. These strategies help in improving the robustness and reproducibility of the models and ensuring that the results are not affected by randomness.
