Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix that are applied after the model training. However, it does mention the use of a crosstabulation method as part of the NHC (Nested Hierarchical Classification) methodology.

In the NHC methodology, after the initial classification of lower-level classes (l3) into higher-level classes (l1), the average capture values of l3 classes within l1 classes are calculated. Then, the l1 classes are sorted according to Mutual Information (MI) and Local Uncertainty (LI) and placed into l2 bins. The average l1l3a values are then recalculated within each l2 bin. These averaged values are used to determine the l1/l2 crosstabulation results. However, this crosstabulation method did not prove sufficient to distinguish between MI and LI LTA-LU shrub community configurations.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention common postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix, it does mention the use of a crosstabulation method as part of the NHC methodology.
