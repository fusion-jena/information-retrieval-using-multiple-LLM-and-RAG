Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it is common practice in machine learning and image processing to use certain postprocessing techniques to better understand and evaluate the performance of a model. Here are some possible postprocessing steps that could be used in the context of the given study:

1. **Calculation of Metrics:** After training a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) for semantic segmentation, it is important to evaluate the performance of the model. This can be done by calculating various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and Intersection over Union (IoU) for each fuel type class. These metrics can provide insights into how well the model is distinguishing between different fuel types.

2. **Generation of Saliency Maps:** Saliency maps can be used to visualize the regions of the input image that the model is focusing on for a particular class. This can help in understanding which features of the image the model is using to make its predictions. In the context of this study, saliency maps could be used to visualize which parts of the image the DCNN is using to identify different fuel types.

3. **Creation of Confusion Matrices:** A confusion matrix can be created to visualize the performance of the model across all classes. The confusion matrix shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives for each class. This can help in identifying any classes that the model is having trouble distinguishing.

4. **Independent Validation:** The study mentions that field measurement data and raw photos from the Conklin (CK) field site were used solely for independent validation. This could involve applying the trained model to the CK data and comparing the model's predictions to the actual field measurements.

It is important to note that the actual postprocessing steps used would depend on the specific requirements of the study and the research questions being addressed.
