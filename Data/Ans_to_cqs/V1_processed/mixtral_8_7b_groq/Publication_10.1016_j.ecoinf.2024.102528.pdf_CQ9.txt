The provided context does not specify a data repository for the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that a dataset called "Agmon annotated dataset" was created to evaluate the performance of BirdNET. This dataset comprises over 10,900 annotated recordings of more than 75 species. The annotations were carried out by experts at the Agmon Hula Lake Park, located between 35'25.9"E, 32'33.7"N, and 35'06'32.6"E, 33'05.52.1"N.

The dataset is likely not publicly available since the context does not mention any data availability statement or repository link. Additionally, the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in the paper.

Therefore, it is recommended to contact the authors or the Hula Research Center, a joint venture of KKL-JNF and Tel-Hai, for more information about the dataset and potential data access.
