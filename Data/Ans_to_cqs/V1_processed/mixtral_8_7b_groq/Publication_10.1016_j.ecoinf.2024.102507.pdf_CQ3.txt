Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, we can infer that some form of image-level annotation was used, as the deep learning model was trained for image classification tasks, specifically distinguishing tree species in forests using RGB images or hyperspectral data.

The context does mention that the deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), were used to extract high-level semantics from the images, which is essential for tasks like image classification, object detection, and segmentation. This suggests that annotation techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation could have been employed, but the text does not provide explicit details confirming this.

In summary, while the context does not directly answer the query about the data annotation techniques used, it can be inferred that some form of image-level annotation was used, given the emphasis on image classification tasks. However, specific techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation are not mentioned in the provided context.
