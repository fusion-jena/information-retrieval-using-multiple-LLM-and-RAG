Deep learning pipelines can handle various data formats, including images, audio, video, and CSV files, depending on the specific application and the problem being addressed.

In the context of the provided references, several data formats are used in deep learning pipelines for different applications. For instance, in the field of computer vision and pattern recognition, image data formats are predominantly used. In reference [18], a deep learning CNN architecture is applied in smart near-infrared analysis of water pollution for agricultural irrigation resources, where the input data is likely in the form of image files. Similarly, in references [19], [20], and [21], deep learning pipelines are used for insect pest recognition, localization, and counting, with image data as input.

In the medical field, deep learning classifiers are used for computer-aided diagnosis of COVID-19 and pneumonia diseases in X-ray scans (reference [25]). In this case, the input data format is medical imaging data, specifically X-ray scans.

For applications involving audio data, deep learning pipelines can also be employed. However, the provided references do not include any examples of deep learning pipelines using audio data.

Video data can also be used in deep learning pipelines. While the provided references do not include any examples of deep learning pipelines using video data, deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can be used for video analysis tasks such as object detection, tracking, and activity recognition.

CSV files, which typically contain tabular data, can also be used in deep learning pipelines. For example, in the field of natural language processing (NLP), text data can be preprocessed and represented as numerical features in a CSV file, which can then be used as input to a deep learning model. However, the provided references do not include any examples of deep learning pipelines using CSV files.

In summary, deep learning pipelines can handle various data formats, including images, audio, video, and CSV files. The specific data format used depends on the application and the problem being addressed. In the provided references, image data is predominantly used in deep learning pipelines for computer vision and pattern recognition tasks.
