The Pl@ntNet project uses a deep learning model based on the Inception model with batch normalization, which has been pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and fine-tuned on Pl@ntNet data. The model covers 30,261 species and is available through a dedicated API at my.plantnet.org.

After training the model, it needs to be deployed so that it can be used for plant identification. However, the provided context does not go into detail about the specific process followed for deploying the model. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a precise answer to this query.

However, based on common deep learning deployment practices, we can make some educated guesses. One common approach for deploying deep learning models is to serialize the model, which involves converting the model into a format that can be easily loaded and used in a production environment. This serialized model can then be deployed on a platform that is suitable for serving machine learning models.

The Pl@ntNet API is a RESTful JSON-based web service, which suggests that the model is likely deployed on a web server. The API can accept one to five images of a plant and return a list of likely species, along with classification scores and matching images from the database.

Additionally, the 'plantnet' R-package allows users to query the Pl@ntNet API, which suggests that the API provides a convenient interface for interacting with the model.

Overall, while the specific process followed for deploying the Pl@ntNet deep learning model is not provided in the context, it is likely that the model was serialized and deployed on a web server, with an API interface provided for interacting with the model.
