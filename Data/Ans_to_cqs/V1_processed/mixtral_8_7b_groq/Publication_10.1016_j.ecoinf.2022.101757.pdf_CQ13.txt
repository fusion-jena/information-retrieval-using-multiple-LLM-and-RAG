The provided context does not give specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the optimizer. The model used is a pre-trained implementation of DeeplabV3+, which is a popular deep learning model for semantic segmentation tasks. However, the context does not mention any modifications or specific configurations made to the hyperparameters during the training process.

The model was trained on the COCO dataset, which contains 121,408 images and a total of 883,331 object annotations divided into 184 classes. The weights obtained from this pre-trained model were then used for inference on landscape photos to extract objects below the skyline.

While the context provides details about the dataset, the model architecture, and the inference process, it does not mention any specific hyperparameters used during training. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
