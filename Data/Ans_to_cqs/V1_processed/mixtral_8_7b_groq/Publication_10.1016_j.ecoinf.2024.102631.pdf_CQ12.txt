The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Fully Convolutional Network (CNN). This type of network is characterized by its application of 2D convolutions using filters of size 4 × 4 in each layer. The network follows a fully convolutional design, with an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder consists of five blocks that progressively reduce the spatial dimensions and learn features, starting with a convolutional layer with 32 output channels and strides of 2, followed by a residual block. The residual block comprises a Conv-ReLU-Conv structure, enhancing image features. The decoder upscales the feature maps and fuses information from the encoder using skip connections. Each decoder block consists of a transposed convolutional layer to increase spatial resolution, followed by batch normalization and ReLU activation. The final stage of the network involves upsampling the feature maps and applying a convolutional layer with 4 × 4 filters to produce the output. Additionally, Spatial and Channel Attention (SCA) modules are integrated into the architecture to focus on relevant spatial regions and channel-wise information, further enriching the feature representations.
