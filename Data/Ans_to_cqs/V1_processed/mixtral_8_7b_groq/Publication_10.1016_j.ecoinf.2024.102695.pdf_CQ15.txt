The provided context does not give specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the research. However, it discusses various aspects of the pipeline, such as data segmentation, attention mechanisms, and fusion of attention and neural networks for predicting marine chemical data. Common optimization techniques used in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adagrad, Adadelta, and Adam. These methods update the model's parameters based on the gradient of the loss function to minimize the error. Since the context does not mention any optimization techniques, it is possible that the research does not focus on this aspect or uses a different optimization method specific to the application.
