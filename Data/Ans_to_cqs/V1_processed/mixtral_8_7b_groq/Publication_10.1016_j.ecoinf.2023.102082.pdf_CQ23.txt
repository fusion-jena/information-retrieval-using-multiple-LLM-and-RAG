The generalizability of the deep learning model was addressed through several measures. Firstly, the model was trained and tested on three different datasets, each containing forest plots from distinct geographical locations: high-resolution CHM of the Earth (Lang10m) using Sentinel-2 optical images, GEDI CHM Potapov30m, and GEDI CHMs created using Sentinel-2 images. This allowed the model to learn from diverse data sources and improve its ability to handle different input distributions.

Secondly, cross-validation analysis was performed to assess the model's performance and prevent overfitting. Specifically, the model was trained on a subset of the data and then tested on the remaining portion. This process was repeated multiple times, with each iteration using a different subset for training and testing. The results were then averaged to provide a more robust estimation of the model's performance.

Furthermore, the study considered the influence of various factors on the model's outcomes. These factors included the GEDI CHMs dataset of choice and their related spatial resolution, the heterogeneity indices used to calculate the HH, and the forest density. By examining the impact of these factors, the researchers aimed to ensure that the model's predictions were not overly reliant on specific characteristics of the training data.

Lastly, the study compared the performance of two field data indices (Shannon's H and species richness) in assessing the HH. This comparison helped to establish the consistency of the model's predictions across different field data measures and further strengthened the generalizability of the model.

In summary, the generalizability of the deep learning model was enhanced through the use of diverse datasets, cross-validation analysis, examination of influential factors, and comparison of field data indices. These measures allowed the model to learn from a variety of data sources, prevent overfitting, and make predictions that were robust and applicable across different contexts.
