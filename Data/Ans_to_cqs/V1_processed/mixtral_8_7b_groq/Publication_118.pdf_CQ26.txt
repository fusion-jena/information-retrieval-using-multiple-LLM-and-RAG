Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of a subset of the total dataset for comparing the variance of bcubed and purity evaluation metrics of feature representations found using Spectral Indices, MFCC, and Auto Encoder. It is possible that data bias was addressed during the selection of this subset.

The context also mentions the use of an auto-encoder-based approach for ecoacoustic analysis, which involves the use of an auto-encoder architecture to minimize complications. Auto-encoders are a type of neural network that can be used for learning efficient codings of input data. They can be used for addressing data bias by learning a more generalized representation of the input data.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of Spectral Indices and Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) for feature representation. These techniques can also help in addressing data bias by providing a more robust representation of the input data.

In conclusion, while the context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, it does mention the use of an auto-encoder-based approach, Spectral Indices, and MFCC for feature representation, which can help in addressing data bias. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
