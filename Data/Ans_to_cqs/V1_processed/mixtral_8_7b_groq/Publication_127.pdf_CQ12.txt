The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is inferred from the context that a VGG model, which is a type of CNN, is used in the first stage of the pipeline to classify whether an image contains an animal. CNNs are commonly used for image classification tasks due to their ability to effectively process grid-like data, such as images, and extract features.
