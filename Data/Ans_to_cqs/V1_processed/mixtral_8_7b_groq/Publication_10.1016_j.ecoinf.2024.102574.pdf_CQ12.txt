The context provided does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the assessment of deep learning-based classification of LiDAR and UAV point clouds for DTM creation and flood risk mapping. However, it does mention the use of machine learning methods such as random forests, support vector machines, feature fusion techniques, and neural networks. Neural networks is a broad category that includes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Transformers, and many other architectures. Therefore, it can be said that:


The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a neural network, but the specific architecture (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer) is not specified in the given context.
