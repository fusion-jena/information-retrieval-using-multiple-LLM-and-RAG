The provided context discusses various aspects of deep learning, including its foundations, applications, and image processing techniques. However, it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot directly answer the query using the given context.

However, I can provide some general techniques used to address data bias in machine learning and deep learning preprocessing:

1. Stratified sampling: This technique involves dividing the dataset into strata based on specific criteria (e.g., class labels) and then ensuring that each stratum is proportionally represented in the training, validation, and test sets. This method helps maintain balance and reduce bias in the dataset.

2. Oversampling: When a particular class or group is underrepresented in the dataset, oversampling can be used to increase the number of instances from that class. This can be done by replicating instances or using techniques like Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to create new instances based on existing data.

3. Undersampling: In contrast to oversampling, undersampling reduces the number of instances from the overrepresented class or group. This method helps balance the dataset but may result in loss of information.

4. Diverse data collection: Collecting data from various sources, locations, and conditions can help ensure that the dataset is representative and less biased. This technique can help reduce the risk of overfitting and improve the model's generalizability.

5. Data augmentation: Techniques like rotation, scaling, and flipping can be used to artificially increase the size of the dataset and create new instances. This can help reduce overfitting and improve the model's performance on unseen data.

While these techniques are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, they are commonly used in deep learning preprocessing to address data bias.
