The text provided does not give information about the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it discusses various remote sensing datasets related to vegetation and climate change. Specifically, it mentions the use of the 16-day synthesized MOD13Q1 V6 NDVI dataset (MODIS NDVI), the daily NOAA Climate Data Record (CDR) of AVHRR NDVI V5 dataset (CDR AVHRR NDVI), the third generation GIMMS NDVI from AVHRR sensors dataset (GIMMS NDVI), and the SPOT NDVI dataset. These datasets are sourced from the Google Earth Engine platform and the Resource and Environmental Data Center of the Ecological Informatics.

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query regarding the use of MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet in the deep learning pipeline.
