The provided context does not give specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. However, it does mention that a type of convolutional neural network (CNN) called U-Net was used, which performs classification through supervised learning. U-Net has been used in land-cover classification and has been trained using both training and validation data.

The availability of labeling data is crucial for U-Net model applications. In the context, it is mentioned that in North Korea, there is no official land-cover map based on national-scale field data. Therefore, the researchers used phenological characteristics and classified elements based on the most relevant classes.

The context also provides information about the generation of training data for the PCF. For this, 16,660 grid cells with a resolution of 2560 m were created in South Korea. The resolution was selected because the training unit of the U-Net model was 256 pixels, and 2560 m contains 256 pixels of Sentinel-2 with a 10 m resolution. Out of the total cells, 8330 cells were randomly extracted as a mask for training data, and 3,332 cells were randomly extracted as a mask for validation data. The PSI was extracted from these cells to prepare input data for model training.

Therefore, while the context does not provide specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, it does provide information about the data preparation and model selection used in the study.
