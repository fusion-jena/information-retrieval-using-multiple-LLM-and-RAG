Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the model was developed as part of a study that integrated a hybrid model for predicting forest fire vulnerability with a deep learning model-based approach for forest classification.

The study by Pham et al. (2023) mentioned in the context used the ACO-NFS model to estimate the extent of forest fire in the Bo Trach district, Quang Binh province. This model might have been used for deploying the deep learning model developed in the subsequent studies.

Model serialization is a common process followed to deploy deep learning models, and it involves saving the model architecture and weights in a file format that can be loaded later for making predictions. Therefore, it is likely that the deep learning model developed in the study was serialized for deployment.

The platform for deploying the model would depend on the intended use case and the infrastructure available. For instance, if the model is to be deployed as a web service, a cloud-based platform such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure could be used. Alternatively, if the model is to be deployed on a local machine, the platform would depend on the operating system and the available resources.

In summary, while there is no explicit information on the process followed to deploy the deep learning model, it can be inferred that the model was serialized for deployment, and the platform used would depend on the intended use case and the available infrastructure.
