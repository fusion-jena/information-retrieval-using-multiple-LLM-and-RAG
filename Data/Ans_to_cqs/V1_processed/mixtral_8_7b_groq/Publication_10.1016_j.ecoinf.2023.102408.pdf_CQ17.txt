The provided context discusses the use of the SVM algorithm with a regularization parameter (c) to mitigate overfitting, as well as the use of the artificial neural network (ANN) in a study. However, it does not explicitly mention the use of dropout or L2 regularization, which are common regularization methods in deep learning.

In the context, the SVM algorithm is used to address the overfitting issue by tuning the parameter (c) to optimize the line fit and penalize the number of samples inside the margin. This method helps to find a balance between the margin size and overfitting.

The ANN model used in the study consists of input, hidden, and output layers, and it uses calibration parameters such as learning rate and weight to improve the results. The number of units in the hidden layer (size) and regularization parameter to avoid overfitting (decay) were passed as arrays of 1-20 and 0.025-1, respectively. However, it is not specified if these are used as dropout or L2 regularization methods.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to confirm the use of dropout or L2 regularization methods to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
