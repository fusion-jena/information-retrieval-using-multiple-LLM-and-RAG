In the field of deep learning, particularly in image classification, several datasets are commonly used for training and testing models. These include MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet.

The MNIST dataset is a set of 70,000 small images of digits handwritten by high school students and employees of the US Census Bureau. Each image is 28x28 pixels, grayscale, and labeled with a digit from 0 to 9. It's often used as a starting point for learning about machine learning and neural networks.

The CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets consist of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 and 100 classes, respectively. They are divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. The classes are divided into five superclasses, each containing two classes. CIFAR datasets are used for object recognition tasks and are more complex than MNIST due to their color images and larger number of classes.

The ImageNet dataset is a large-scale dataset of over 14 million images, each labeled with one of 21,841 categories. It's divided into training, validation, and test sets. ImageNet is used in the annual ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC), a benchmark in object category recognition.

In the context provided, the ImageNet dataset is specifically mentioned as one of the well-known datasets where Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown outstanding performances in image classification tasks. It's often used as a benchmark for comparing the performance of different deep learning models.

In summary, MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet are commonly used datasets in the deep learning pipeline for image classification tasks. MNIST is a simple dataset of handwritten digits, while CIFAR and ImageNet are more complex, with a larger number of classes and color images. ImageNet is particularly notable as it's used in the ILSVRC, a benchmark for object category recognition.
