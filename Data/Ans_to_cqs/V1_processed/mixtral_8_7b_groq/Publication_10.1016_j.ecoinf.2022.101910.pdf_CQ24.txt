The provided context does not directly discuss strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of BirdNET, a deep neural network for bird vocalization detection and classification. In the context of using BirdNET, specific settings are adjusted to optimize its performance, but it does not mention any strategies to control randomness in the deep learning process.

In general, deep learning models often include some form of randomness, such as random weight initialization or dropout regularization, which can impact model performance and reproducibility. To handle randomness, deep learning practitioners may employ various strategies, such as:

1. Fixed random seed value: By setting a fixed random seed value, the random number generator will produce the same sequence of random numbers, ensuring consistent and reproducible results across multiple runs. This is particularly important for comparing different models or hyperparameter settings.

2. Model ensembling: Combining multiple models trained with different random seeds can improve overall performance and reduce the impact of individual model randomness.

3. Cross-validation: To account for randomness in model training, cross-validation techniques can be used to train and evaluate models on different subsets of the data, providing a more robust estimate of model performance.

4. Regularization techniques: Strategies such as dropout, weight decay, or early stopping can help reduce overfitting and improve model generalization, thereby mitigating the impact of randomness in the learning process.

While the provided context does not discuss these specific strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, they are common practices in the field of machine learning and deep learning.
