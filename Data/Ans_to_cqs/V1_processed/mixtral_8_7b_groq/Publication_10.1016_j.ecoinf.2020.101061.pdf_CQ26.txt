The provided context discusses a study that uses deep learning for airborne imagery analysis, specifically for detecting individual tree crowns. However, it does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.

The pretraining annotations are generated automatically using a LiDAR-based unsupervised algorithm, and data augmentation of random flips and translations was tested but found to have little effect on the final score. The training models were done using different proportions of training data, including 0% hand-annotated data, to assess the addition of hand-annotated data.

The experiments performed to assess generalization among sites include using pretraining and hand-annotated data to predict the evaluation data from the same site (within-site), using pretraining data and hand-annotated from the same site to predict the evaluation data from a different site (cross-site), and testing a model training using pretraining data from all other sites, but hand annotations from the same site as the evaluation data (transfer-learning).

However, none of these techniques directly address data bias during preprocessing. Data bias can occur due to various reasons, such as an imbalanced dataset, missing data, or poor data representation. To address data bias, techniques such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection can be employed during preprocessing.

In conclusion, while the provided context discusses a deep learning pipeline for airborne imagery analysis, it does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. Techniques such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection can be used to address data bias during preprocessing.
