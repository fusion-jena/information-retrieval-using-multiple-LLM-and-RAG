Based on the provided context, there is no information that specifies the platform used to deploy a deep learning model. The text focuses on the methodology, data, and authorship of a research project related to forestry and ecological informatics. It does not mention any details about the deployment of a deep learning model, including which platform was used. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
