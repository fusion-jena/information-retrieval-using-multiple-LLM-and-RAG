The provided article abstract and keywords do not contain information about the specific hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. The abstract discusses the impact of data structure on machine learning models, particularly focusing on the Random Forest (RF) algorithm and Generalised Linear Model (GLM), in the context of species distribution modeling. The authors mention the use of camera trap data for their study, but there is no mention of the hardware resources used for training their models.

To provide a comprehensive answer, I would need to examine the full text of the article, as the information provided in the abstract alone is not sufficient. However, based on the information given, it is not possible to determine the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model.

 The provided article abstract and keywords do not contain information about the specific hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. The authors discuss the importance of data structure in machine learning models and the impact of spatial patterns on the performance of GLM and RF algorithms. They reference several papers that compare Random Forests and Logistic Regression in predictive modeling, but there is no mention of the hardware resources used for training their models. Therefore, based on the information given, it is not possible to determine the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model.
