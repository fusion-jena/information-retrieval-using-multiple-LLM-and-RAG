The provided context does not explicitly mention which framework was used to build the deep learning model. The text focuses on the use of active learning strategies to train a deep neural network, specifically the MegaDetector model, on a large dataset. It explains how different query selection strategies were compared to a control of selecting samples at random, and how the model achieved a high accuracy after a certain number of active queries. However, it does not specify the deep learning framework used, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
