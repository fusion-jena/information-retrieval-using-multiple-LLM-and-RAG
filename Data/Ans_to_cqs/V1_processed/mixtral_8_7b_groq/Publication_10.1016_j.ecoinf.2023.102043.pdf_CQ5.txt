The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline described in the context are not explicitly mentioned as standard datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, a specific dataset is created for the purpose of detecting goat vocalizations.

This dataset is collected from four farms (A, B, C, D) and contains a total of approximately 10 million sound events, lasting over 34,000 hours. The dataset is divided into 70% for training, 10% for validation, and 20% for testing. The audio data is preprocessed by converting it to a monophonic channel, resampling it at 16 kHz, extracting the spectrogram using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) magnitudes of 25 ms overlapped by 15 ms, and calculating the Mel spectrogram by mapping to 64 bins of the Mel scale within the range of 125â€“7500 Hz.

The preprocessed data is then used as input to the YAMNet model for extracting the embeddings. YAMNet is a pre-trained deep neural network model that follows the MobileV1 convolution architecture and is trained on the AudioSet-YouTube corpus, which consists of data from 521 classes.

Therefore, the dataset used in this deep learning pipeline is a custom dataset specifically created for detecting goat vocalizations, and it undergoes preprocessing and is used in conjunction with the YAMNet model for extracting embeddings.
