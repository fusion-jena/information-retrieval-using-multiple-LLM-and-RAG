I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the use of machine learning algorithms for tree species classification using remote sensing data, particularly a study conducted by Jernej et al. (2023). However, it does not mention where the code repository for this deep learning pipeline is available, such as on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. I hope this information can be provided in future publications or updates.
