The provided context discusses the use of deep learning algorithms to count wildebeest in survey images and the importance of crowd-sourced data in creating training sets for these algorithms. However, it does not go into detail about the process of deploying the trained deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.

However, based on general knowledge of deep learning model deployment, the process would likely involve the following steps:

1. Model serialization: This step involves saving the trained deep learning model to disk so that it can be loaded and used in other environments. This is typically done by using a model serialization library provided by the deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow).
2. Platform selection: The deployed model may be used in a variety of settings, such as on a local machine, in a cloud-based environment, or on an edge device. The selection of the platform will depend on the specific use case and the resources available.
3. Model loading: Once the model is serialized and the platform is selected, the model can be loaded into the target environment.
4. Model serving: This step involves integrating the model into an application or service so that it can be used to make predictions. This may involve creating a REST API or a similar interface for the model.
5. Model monitoring and maintenance: After the model is deployed, it is important to monitor its performance and make adjustments as needed. This may involve retraining the model on new data or updating the model architecture.

It's worth noting that, while the context does not provide specific details on the deployment process, it does mention that the approach is transferable and that the trained algorithm can achieve high accuracy levels. This suggests that the deployment process was successful and that the model is able to make accurate predictions.
