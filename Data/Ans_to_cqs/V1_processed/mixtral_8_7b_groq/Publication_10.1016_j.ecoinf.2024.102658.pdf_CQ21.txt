Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. However, it does mention that model performance is evaluated using both random cross-validation and spatial cross-validation, with the spatial cross-validation being repeated over 100 random blocking configurations. The selected features are then used to train Bayesian logistic regression, MLE logistic regression, Bayesian GAM, and random forest models.

The results of the models are presented in Figures 3, 4, and B.11, and the observations and analysis of these results are discussed in the text. The analysis includes interpretations of the scores and visualizations, as well as diagnoses of any problems.

Additionally, the context mentions that two sets of features were selected from a larger pool of available features, and that the features were scaled as part of the modeling options. For the priors, the priorsense package was used to optimize the exploration of different configurations.

In summary, while the context does not provide specific details on postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix, it does mention that model performance is evaluated using cross-validation and that the results are analyzed and discussed. Additionally, feature selection and scaling were performed as part of the modeling options.
