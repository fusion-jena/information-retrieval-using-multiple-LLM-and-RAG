Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about how the hyperparameters of the model, such as the learning rate, batch size, and number of interactions, were optimized. The text does not mention the use of methods like grid search, random search, or any other optimization techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to how the hyperparameters were optimized. However, it is mentioned that the parameters were defined based on tests, which suggests that some sort of testing or validation process was used to determine the optimal hyperparameters. Without further information, it is not possible to give a more detailed answer.
