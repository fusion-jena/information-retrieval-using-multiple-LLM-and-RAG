The provided context does not include information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete for the monitoring program. The text mentions various aspects of the program, such as data collection, data validation, and the involvement of dive staff and citizen scientists. However, it does not mention any details about the training process or how to determine when it is complete.

The context does mention that the app used in the monitoring program does not require submission of photographic evidence, which could be used for validation by experts or machine learning algorithms. This suggests that some level of training may be necessary for citizen scientists to accurately identify and report the species they observe. However, the text does not provide information on how this training is conducted or evaluated.

It is possible that the criteria for determining when training is complete are not specified in the provided text because they are not relevant to the focus of the study. The study appears to be primarily concerned with the effectiveness of the monitoring program and the quality of the data collected, rather than the training process itself.

In summary, the provided context does not include information on the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the monitoring program. It is possible that such criteria are not specified in the text because they are not relevant to the focus of the study.
