The provided context does not directly discuss the deep learning pipeline or its data collection methods. However, it does offer insights into the data collection processes for a specific ecological study, which can be used to infer potential data collection methods for a deep learning pipeline.

In the ecological study, the researchers used a comprehensive dataset compiled between 2010 and 2022, consisting of occurrence records of wild goat, urial, and jebeer gazelle in the central Iranian plateau. The data collection involved two primary sources:

1. Direct observation by the research team: A subset of the dataset was directly observed and documented by the research team through on-the-ground observations and information provided by park rangers.

2. Public or secondary datasets: The remaining portion of the dataset was obtained from existing resources, including scientific publications and possibly other public or restricted databases.

These methods can be applied to a deep learning pipeline in the following ways:

1. Surveys: Conducting surveys, either online or offline, can help gather raw data for a deep learning pipeline. Surveys can be targeted at specific demographics or the general public, depending on the study's requirements.

2. Sensors: Deploying sensors relevant to the study can provide continuous data streams. These sensors can include cameras, microphones, or other IoT devices that capture data related to the problem at hand.

3. Public datasets: Utilizing existing public datasets can help augment the data collected specifically for the deep learning pipeline. These datasets can provide additional context or examples that can improve the model's performance.

4. Collaboration with domain experts: Collaborating with domain experts can help identify relevant data sources or methods for collecting raw data. These experts can include park rangers, healthcare professionals, or other professionals working in the field related to the deep learning pipeline.

In summary, the methods for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline can include surveys, sensors, public datasets, and collaboration with domain experts. These methods ensure a diverse and robust dataset for training and validating deep learning models.
