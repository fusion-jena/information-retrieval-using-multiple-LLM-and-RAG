I'm sorry for any confusion, but the provided context does not contain information about deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context refers to a study by Wang and Shan (2024) that compares the performance of two time series classification methods, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and feature-based clustering, on rabbit population data from the state of Mississippi, US. The study also compares the results to those identified by the Theil-Sen analysis (TSA). Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
