Based on the provided context, there are no specific details mentioned about postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix that were performed after the model training. However, we do have information about the final output of the model and the process of collecting training data.

The final output of the model is the 'Final Reclassified Map (OUTPUT)', which represents the final output of the entire model. This output file is generated after the water reclass model has been run 12 times with different initial classified maps from the GEE step.

As for the training data, it was collected using Landsat images along with the cluster classification maps. Seventy training sites in the form of points were selected for each of the five classes (mines, water, forest, urban areas, and bare soil), making up a total of 350 points per image. The points were selected using a stratified (by class) random sampling approach and were distributed across the entire study area. It is important to note that due to the vast and remote study area, it was not feasible to collect training or validation data through fieldwork.

In summary, based on the given context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include generating the 'Final Reclassified Map (OUTPUT)'. However, there is no information provided about Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, Confusion matrix, or any other detailed analysis of the model's performance.
