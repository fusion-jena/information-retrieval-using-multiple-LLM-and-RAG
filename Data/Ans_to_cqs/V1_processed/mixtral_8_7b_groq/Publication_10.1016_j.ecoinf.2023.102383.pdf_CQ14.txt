Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, such as through methods like grid search or random search. However, the text does provide some details about the specific values used for certain parameters.

For instance, the parameter Î», which is used to determine whether an object is "big" or "small" based on its area, is set to 320 for this study. This value was determined empirically and is different from the more common value of 224, which is often used for models trained on the ImageNet dataset.

Additionally, the text mentions the use of "hard negative mining" in the training phase. This technique involves selectively mining hard negative examples during training, which can help the model better distinguish between objects and background regions and improve overall performance. However, this is not a method for hyperparameter optimization.

Therefore, while the text provides some details about specific parameter values and training techniques, it does not explicitly answer the query about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.
