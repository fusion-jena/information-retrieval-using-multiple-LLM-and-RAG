The text provided does not give a detailed explanation of the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does provide some contextual clues that can help us outline a possible sequence of steps that could have been taken.

Firstly, the model was implemented in a Python-based computational environment using the Keras framework with TensorFlow as a backend. This suggests that the model was developed and trained in a local environment, possibly on a PC with a Nvidia Tesla K80 GPU.

Once the model was trained, it would need to be serialized, or saved, in a format that could be loaded and used in a production environment. Keras provides several options for model serialization, including the ability to save the model architecture and weights to a single file using the `save()` method. This would allow the model to be easily loaded and used in a new environment.

The text does not provide information on the specific platform or environment that the model was deployed to. However, it does mention that the model was assessed on sub-images generated from image #2, and that images #4 and #6 were used for visualization and demonstration of the algorithm's efficacy. This suggests that the model was at least used in a separate evaluation environment, possibly on a different machine or server.

In terms of platform selection, the choice of platform would depend on a number of factors, including the intended use case for the model, the resources available, and the performance requirements. For example, if the model was being used for real-time image analysis, a high-performance GPU-enabled platform might be necessary to ensure fast and accurate predictions. On the other hand, if the model was being used for batch processing of large numbers of images, a CPU-based platform might be sufficient.

Overall, while the text does not provide a detailed explanation of the deployment process, it is possible to infer that the model was serialized using Keras, and likely deployed to a separate environment for evaluation and use. The choice of platform would depend on a number of factors, including the intended use case and performance requirements.
