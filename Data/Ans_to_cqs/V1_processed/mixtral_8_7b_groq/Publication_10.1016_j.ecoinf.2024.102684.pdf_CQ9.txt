The provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on discussing the use of deep learning techniques in remote sensing, the limitations of these models in terms of transfer learning and generalization, and the importance of robust validation criteria for these complex environments. It also describes the machine learning hyperparameter search conducted over two sites, including the activation function, optimizer, learning rate, and fully connected architecture. However, there is no mention of the data repository or where the code and data used in the study are available. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
