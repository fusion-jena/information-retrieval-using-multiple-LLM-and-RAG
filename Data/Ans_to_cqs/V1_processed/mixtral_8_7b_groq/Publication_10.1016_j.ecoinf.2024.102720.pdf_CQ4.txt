Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, data augmentation techniques are commonly used in deep learning to increase the amount of training data, improve model performance, and prevent overfitting. Some common data augmentation techniques for images include:

1. Flipping: This involves flipping the image horizontally or vertically, which can help the model generalize better and be more robust to changes in orientation.

2. Rotation: Rotating the image by a certain angle can help the model learn to recognize objects in different positions and orientations.

3. Scaling: Changing the size of the image can help the model learn to recognize objects at different scales.

4. Translation: Shifting the image horizontally or vertically can help the model learn to recognize objects in different positions.

5. Cropping: Randomly cropping parts of the image can help the model focus on important features and reduce the impact of irrelevant information.

6. Color jittering: Changing the brightness, contrast, saturation, or hue of the image can help the model learn to recognize objects in different lighting conditions.

7. Gaussian noise: Adding Gaussian noise to the image can help the model learn to recognize objects in noisy environments.

8. Elastic deformation: This involves applying a random warping to the image, which can help the model learn to recognize objects in deformed or distorted conditions.

These techniques can be applied to the training data during the deep learning pipeline to generate new variations of the original data, thereby increasing the size and diversity of the training set. However, the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for the studies mentioned in the context are not provided.
