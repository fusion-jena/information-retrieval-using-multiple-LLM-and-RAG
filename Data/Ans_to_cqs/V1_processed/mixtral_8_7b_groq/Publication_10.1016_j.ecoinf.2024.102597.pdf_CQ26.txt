The provided context discusses the use of various machine learning algorithms for water quality prediction, but it does not directly mention the preprocessing techniques used in deep learning for addressing data bias. However, it is stated that the use of deep learning algorithms was considered but not implemented due to the limited number of samples.

In general, when it comes to deep learning, data bias can be addressed during the preprocessing stage using techniques such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified sampling is a method of sampling that ensures each stratum or subgroup of the population is proportionally represented in the sample. This technique can be used to ensure that the training and testing datasets have a similar distribution of classes, reducing bias.

Oversampling is a technique used to increase the number of instances of the minority class in the dataset. This can help to reduce bias by ensuring that the model is trained on a more balanced dataset. However, oversampling can lead to overfitting, so it is important to use techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) that create synthetic samples rather than simply duplicating existing ones.

Undersampling is a technique used to decrease the number of instances of the majority class in the dataset. This can help to reduce bias by ensuring that the model is not trained on a dataset that is heavily skewed towards one class. However, undersampling can lead to loss of information, so it is important to use techniques that maintain the diversity of the dataset.

Diverse data collection is a technique used to ensure that the dataset is representative of the population. This can help to reduce bias by ensuring that the model is trained on a dataset that is diverse and includes instances from all subgroups of the population.

In summary, while the provided context does not specifically mention the preprocessing techniques used in deep learning for addressing data bias, techniques such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection can be used to address data bias during the preprocessing stage of deep learning.
