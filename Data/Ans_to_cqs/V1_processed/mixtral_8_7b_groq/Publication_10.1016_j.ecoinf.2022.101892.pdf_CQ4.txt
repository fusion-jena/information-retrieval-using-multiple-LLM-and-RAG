The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include color jittering, rotation, and random erasing. These techniques are used to increase the diversity of the training data and prevent overfitting.

Color jittering involves randomly changing the brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue of the images in the training set. This helps the model to learn to recognize objects in images with different color characteristics, improving its generalization ability.

Rotation is another data augmentation technique used in the pipeline. This involves rotating the images in the training set by a random angle. This helps the model to learn to recognize objects in images taken from different angles, improving its ability to handle real-world images.

Random erasing is a technique that involves randomly erasing rectangular regions of the images in the training set. This helps the model to learn to recognize objects in images with missing or occluded parts, improving its robustness.

Additionally, the pipeline includes horizontal flipping, which is a common data augmentation technique used to increase the size of the training set by creating a mirrored version of each image.

These data augmentation techniques are applied to the training set during the training process. Specifically, they are applied to each mini-batch of images before they are fed to the deep neural network.

It is worth noting that the specific parameters of these data augmentation techniques, such as the degree of rotation and the size and location of the erased rectangles, are not specified in the context. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a more detailed answer.

In summary, the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline include color jittering, rotation, random erasing, and horizontal flipping. These techniques help to increase the diversity of the training data, prevent overfitting, and improve the model's ability to handle real-world images.
