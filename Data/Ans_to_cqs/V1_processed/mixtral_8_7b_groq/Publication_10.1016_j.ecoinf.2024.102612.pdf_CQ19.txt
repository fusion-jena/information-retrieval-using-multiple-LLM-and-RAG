The text provided does not give explicit information about the specific deep learning framework used to build the model. However, it does mention the use of tensors, which are a key component of many deep learning libraries. For instance, both TensorFlow and PyTorch use tensors to handle data. Therefore, it's possible that one of these popular deep learning libraries was used. However, without more specific information, it's not possible to give a definitive answer.
