In the context provided, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not explicitly stated. However, it is mentioned that a five-fold subject-exclusive (SE) method was applied to ensure that the same subject did not appear in the training set and testing set at the same time. This suggests that the data was split subject-wise, rather than randomly or based on other factors.

Additionally, it is mentioned that the model was pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and then fine-tuned on the PAD Full and PAD Lite datasets. This implies that the data was split into two parts - one for pre-training and another for fine-tuning.

Furthermore, aggressive data augmentation was applied to avoid overfitting and imbalanced problem. However, it is not specified whether this augmentation was done on the training set, testing set, or both.

In deep learning model training, it is common to split the data into three sets - training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune the hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance. However, based on the context provided, it is not clear whether this three-way split was applied.

Therefore, while some information about the data split is provided, the full criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not explicitly stated in the context provided.
