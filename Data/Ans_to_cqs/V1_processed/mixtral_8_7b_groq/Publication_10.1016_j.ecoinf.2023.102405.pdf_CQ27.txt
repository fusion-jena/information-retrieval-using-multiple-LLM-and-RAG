The provided context does not include information on the specific steps taken to deploy the trained deep learning model after training. It discusses the training process of an Attention-based Overview-Driven Gated Recurrent Unit (AODEGRU) model for water contamination analysis in IoT-enabled aquaculture. The training process includes initializing the model, defining the loss function and optimizer, training the model over multiple epochs, and calculating the training loss and accuracy for each epoch. However, it does not mention any steps related to model deployment, such as model serialization, platform selection, or model integration with a larger system. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query based on the given context.
