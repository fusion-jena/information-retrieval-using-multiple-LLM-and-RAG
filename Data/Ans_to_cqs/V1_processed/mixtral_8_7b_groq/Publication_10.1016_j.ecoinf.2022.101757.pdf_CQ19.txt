The context provided does not give specific information about the deep learning framework used to build the model. However, it does mention that the authors used an implementation of DeepLabV3+ available on GitHub (<https://github.com/zllrunning/deeplab-pytorch-crf>), which suggests that PyTorch was used as the deep learning framework.

The authors used pre-trained weights from an implementation of DeepLabV3+ with the COCO dataset, which contains 121,408 images and a total of 883,331 object annotations divided into 184 classes. The authors then inferred the model on landscape photos without training it directly on those photos.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly state that PyTorch was used, the fact that the authors used an implementation of DeepLabV3+ available on a PyTorch-based GitHub repository suggests that PyTorch was the deep learning framework used to build the model.
