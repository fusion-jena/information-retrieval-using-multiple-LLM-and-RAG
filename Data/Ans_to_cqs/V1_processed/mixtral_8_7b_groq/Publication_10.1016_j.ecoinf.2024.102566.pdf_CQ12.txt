Based on the provided context, there is no information indicating that a specific deep learning model, such as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer, is used in the pipeline for forest biomass estimation. The context mainly discusses the use of remote sensing data, forest inventory data, and machine learning techniques for biomass estimation.

Chen (2007) mentions the use of machine learning methods for developing Above Ground Biomass (AGB) models, but does not specify the type of deep learning model used. Similarly, Jan et al. (2006) discuss the use of small-footprint LiDAR data for forest volume and biomass estimation, but do not mention any deep learning models.

Therefore, it is not possible to answer this query without additional information.
