The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the F1-score, which is a type of harmonic mean of precision and recall. The F1-score is calculated by taking the proportion of true positive predictions (relevant instances that are correctly identified) out of the sum of true positive predictions, false negative predictions (relevant instances that are not identified), and false positive predictions (irrelevant instances that are incorrectly identified).

In the context provided, the deep learning model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that is used to predict the historical geographical distribution of wetlands in a specific area. The CNN is trained using a dataset that is split into several larger blocks based on coordinates, and then split into smaller areas of 80 Ã— 80 pixels.

To evaluate the performance of the CNN, a 10-fold cross validation is performed. During cross validation, the dataset is divided into 10 different sets, and the CNN is trained and evaluated using each set. The final performance of the CNN is calculated as the average performance across all 10 sets.

The F1-score is chosen as the evaluation metric because it takes into account both precision and recall, which are important considerations for this particular application. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions, and recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all relevant instances. The F1-score is a balanced measure of these two metrics, and is a useful way to evaluate the overall performance of the CNN.

In addition to the F1-score, other metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall could also be used to evaluate the performance of the CNN. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions, and is a simple and widely used metric for evaluating the performance of machine learning models. Precision and recall, as mentioned earlier, are also important metrics for evaluating the performance of the CNN in this specific application. However, in the provided context, the F1-score is the only metric that is explicitly mentioned as being used to evaluate the performance of the CNN.
