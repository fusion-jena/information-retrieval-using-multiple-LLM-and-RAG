The deep learning pipeline can handle various data formats, including image, audio, video, and CSV files. However, the provided context focuses mainly on the use of image data in the deep learning pipeline, specifically in the context of wetland classification.

In the given context, the image data format is used for training and testing deep learning models for wetland classification. For instance, the Vision Transformer (ViT) and Swin Transformer models are used for classifying wetland types using remote sensing imagery. These transformer-based models utilize an attention-based approach, which allows them to acquire global contextual knowledge, leading to better generalization capabilities compared to CNN algorithms.

Furthermore, the context presents a comparison of various deep learning models, including the proposed end-to-end algorithm, CoAtNet, CNN + ST (ours), GAN + ST (ours), and 3DUNetGSFormer (ours), in the context of wetland classification using image data. These models are evaluated based on their performance metrics, such as Kappa index (KI), Overall accuracy (OA), Average accuracy (AA), and Time (h).

Therefore, based on the provided context, image data is the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline for wetland classification tasks. However, the context does not explicitly mention other data formats, such as audio, video, or CSV files. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that deep learning models can be adapted to handle various data formats depending on the specific application and task at hand.
