The deep learning pipeline in the CNN model for head capsule image classification utilizes the Keras library with TensorFlow as the back-end engine, which supports various optimization techniques. However, the specific optimization technique is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

The CNN model is trained in a two-stage process, where the first stage trains only the top classifier (a fully connected layer) based on features extracted from processing images with a pretrained convolutional part of the network. In the second stage, the network is trained as a whole in a fine-tuned manner using smaller learning rates. This two-phase approach helps in speeding up the process and achieving optimal model performance.

Furthermore, data augmentation is applied to increase the sample size by randomly deforming input images in each training cycle. Dropout techniques are also used to enhance model robustness by applying them to extracted features.

However, the specific optimization technique used during the training of the model, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), or others, is not provided in the context. Therefore, it is not possible to answer this question without additional information.
