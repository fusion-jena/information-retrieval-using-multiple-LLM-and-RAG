Based on the provided context, the post-processing steps involved after the model training include the analysis of the model's performance metrics and the examination of the spatial patterns within the seagrass meadow ecosystem.

Firstly, the accuracy, precision, and recall of models retrained on incremental datasets are evaluated. These metrics are calculated for different classes, specifically for vegetation, bare, and other categories. The original model scores are also shown for comparison. The size of the imagery dataset varies, including training, validation, and test ground-truth images.

Secondly, the spatial patterns within the seagrass meadow ecosystem are analyzed. This process involves the project administration, methodology, investigation, funding acquisition, data curation, and conceptualization. Although the context does not explicitly mention saliency maps or confusion matrices, these are common methods used in post-processing to visualize and evaluate the performance of deep learning models.

In the given project, the deep learning model used for semantic segmentation of vegetation mapping underwent specific post-processing steps during the training phase. The images in the ground-truth dataset were reduced to a resolution of 1000 Ã— 1333 pixels, and the three color channels of the images were normalized using the means and standard deviations per channel based on the ImageNet dataset. This normalization was applied to the (pre-trained) RestNet-50 model, using mean values of [0.485, 0.456, 0.406] and standard deviations of [0.229, 0.224, 0.225].

After training, the DETR model's object queries parameter was set to 100, allowing for the detection of up to 100 turtles in an image. This step was taken to ensure sufficient detection capabilities for all case-study images.

In summary, the post-processing steps after model training in this context involve evaluating the model's performance using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics, analyzing spatial patterns within the seagrass meadow ecosystem, and applying specific post-processing techniques during the training phase, such as image resolution reduction, color channel normalization, and object query parameter setting. Saliency maps and confusion matrices are not explicitly mentioned but are common methods used in post-processing deep learning models.
