The type of deep learning model used in the described pipeline is an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network, a variant of the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model. This is inferred from the context that discusses the optimization of hyperparameters for LSTM models and the structure of the ACE forecasting model based on an LSTM neural network. The text also highlights the effectiveness of LSTM networks in carbon emission prediction, further confirming their use in the pipeline.
