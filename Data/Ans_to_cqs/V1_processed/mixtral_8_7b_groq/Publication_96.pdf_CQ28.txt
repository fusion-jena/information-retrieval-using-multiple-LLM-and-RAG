The Google Cloud Platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. The researchers conducted their analysis using graphics processing units (GPUs) and specialized hardware components for running parallel arithmetic operations, which were implemented on the Google Cloud suite of cloud Platform. Furthermore, the training areas and Landsat imagery were exported to Google Cloud Storage and used as input in a Virtual Machine to process the Deep Learning scripts. Therefore, it is evident that the Google Cloud Platform was used to deploy the deep learning model for mapping burn scars in the Cerrado biome in Brazil.
