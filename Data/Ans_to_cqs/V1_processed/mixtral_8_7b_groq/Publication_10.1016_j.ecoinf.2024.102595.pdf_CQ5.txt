The provided context does not include specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for oil palm yield prediction. However, it does mention that machine learning and deep learning models have been applied to predict crop yields, including oil palm. These models take into account various factors such as climate patterns, soil quality, fertilizer use, and seed varieties.

In general, when it comes to deep learning applications in computer vision tasks, popular datasets include MNIST for handwritten digit recognition, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 for object recognition, and ImageNet for large-scale image classification. These datasets are widely used to train and test deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

However, in the context of oil palm yield prediction, the datasets might not be publicly available or standardized like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, they could be specific to the research studies or institutions working on oil palm yield prediction. The datasets could include factors like historical climate data, soil analysis results, fertilizer application records, and seed variety information.

To summarize, while the provided context does not offer specific details about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for oil palm yield prediction, it is mentioned that deep learning models have been applied to predict crop yields using various agronomic parameters. In general, deep learning models in computer vision are often trained on datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet, but these might not be directly applicable to oil palm yield prediction.
