Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model. However, there is information about the training process of productivity models for certain species using the random forest algorithm and the R package “ranger”. But this information does not include details about the deployment of the trained models.

In general, the process of deploying a deep learning model involves several steps after training the model. Here is a possible process:

1. Model serialization: This step involves saving the trained model to a file, which can be used for later deployment. This is done to avoid retraining the model every time it is needed.
2. Platform selection: This step involves choosing the platform where the model will be deployed. This could be a local machine, a server, or a cloud platform.
3. Model deployment: This step involves loading the saved model and using it to make predictions. This can be done in different ways depending on the platform and the requirements of the application.
4. Model monitoring: This step involves monitoring the performance of the model in production to ensure that it is working as expected.

Without specific information about the deep learning model in question, it is not possible to provide a detailed answer about the process followed to deploy it. However, the general steps mentioned above are typically involved in the deployment of deep learning models.
