I am unable to provide the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline as none of the provided sources mention or give a link to such a repository. The sources mainly discuss the use of various remote sensing technologies and machine learning methods for different purposes, such as biomass estimation, tree species classification, and canopy height mapping. While some of them mention the use of deep learning techniques, they do not provide any information about the code repository or the implementation details of the deep learning pipelines.
