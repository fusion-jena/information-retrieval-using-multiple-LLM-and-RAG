The provided context suggests that the deep learning model for bird sound data processing was trained using Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). In the paper "GPU-based training of autoencoders for bird sound data processing" by Guo et al., 2017, the authors specifically mention using GPUs for training. However, there is no explicit mention of other hardware resources such as TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) being used for training. Therefore, based on the given context, it can be concluded that GPUs were used for training the deep learning model.
