The provided context discusses Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) and the GRELMA algorithm for clustering, but it does not mention any optimization techniques specifically used in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam.

ELMs are a type of Single-Hidden Layer Feed Forward Neural Network (SLFFNN) that uses random weights and biases in the hidden layer, and calculates the output weights with a single matrix multiplication. This approach allows ELMs to learn from huge training data sets quickly and accurately, and generalize well based on their training data set.

The GRELMA algorithm, on the other hand, is an unsupervised learning algorithm used for clustering in a multi-layered neural network model. It uses the outputs of each level as inputs to the next one, and the algorithm is described in detail in the provided context.

Deep learning pipelines typically use optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam to adjust the weights and biases of the neural network during training. These techniques help to minimize the loss function and improve the accuracy of the model. However, the provided context does not mention any specific optimization techniques used in the ELM or GRELMA algorithms.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the provided context does not mention any optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as SGD or Adam.
