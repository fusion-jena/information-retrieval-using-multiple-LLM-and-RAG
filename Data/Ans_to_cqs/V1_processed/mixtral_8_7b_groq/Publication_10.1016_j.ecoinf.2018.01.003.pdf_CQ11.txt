The provided context does not include information about a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context mainly discusses the development of neural network models, including the classical neural network models, Bayesian learning machine, and deep learning algorithms. It explains how deep learning algorithms have extended the number of layers in neural networks, allowing for the extraction of deeply hidden features and characteristics. The context also includes a case study of using a backpropagation neural network (BPNN) to predict the ecological footprint (EF) of Beijing, but it does not mention any data repository for this deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I am unable to provide a data repository link based on the given context.
