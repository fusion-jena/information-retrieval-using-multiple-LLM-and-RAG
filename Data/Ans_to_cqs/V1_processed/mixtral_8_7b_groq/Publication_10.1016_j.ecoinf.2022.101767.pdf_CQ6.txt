The provided context discusses a study that involved analyzing YouTube videos of wild birds, but it does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps taken before training a deep learning model. However, based on general practices in data preprocessing for deep learning models, we can infer some possible steps that might have been involved.



In preparing the YouTube video data for training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps could have been involved, such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning.

Normalization is a common preprocessing step to adjust the range of input features to a similar scale, preventing any particular feature from dominating the learning process. This can be achieved by rescaling the data to a range of 0 to 1 or by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.

Scaling is another preprocessing technique that adjusts the range of features, similar to normalization. However, scaling does not alter the mean and standard deviation of the data. This method is useful when the features have different units, and it is essential to maintain the relative scale between them.

Cleaning the data is an essential step in preparing the dataset for deep learning models. This process involves handling missing or corrupted values, removing outliers, and dealing with noisy data. For the YouTube video data, this might include removing videos with incomplete or incorrect metadata, handling videos with missing timestamps or species information, and addressing videos with poor audio quality affecting wild bird sound analysis.

In the context of the study, the researchers might have applied these preprocessing steps to the extracted video data, including upload date, thumbnail information, channel details, and wild bird species information. These steps would help ensure the quality and consistency of the data before training a deep learning model to analyze the relationship between video factors and the number of views. However, the provided context does not explicitly mention these preprocessing steps, so this answer is based on general practices in data preprocessing for deep learning models.
