I am unable to provide the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline because the provided context does not contain information about a deep learning pipeline or any data repository link. The context discusses the use of Bayesian networks in various fields such as permafrost thaw, tuberculosis epidemiology, and natural resource management. However, it does not mention any deep learning pipeline or data repository link. I recommend looking for the information in the original sources or contacting the authors for more details.
