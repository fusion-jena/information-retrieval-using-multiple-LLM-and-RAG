Based on the information provided, there is no explicit mention of the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model. The context discusses the development of an equitable nutrient reduction decision support tool using a GIS web app builder, which incorporates estimated pre- and post-BMP pollutant loads and environmental justice metrics. However, it does not specify the steps taken to deploy a deep learning model as part of this process.

The context does mention the use of various components such as WQ inlets, weekly street sweeping, wet pond, and wetland detention, but these are referred to as Best Management Practices (BMPs) within the nutrient reduction tool. It is possible that a deep learning model was used during the development of the tool, but the details of its training, serialization, and platform selection for deployment are not provided in the text.

Therefore, it is not possible to accurately answer this query without additional information.
