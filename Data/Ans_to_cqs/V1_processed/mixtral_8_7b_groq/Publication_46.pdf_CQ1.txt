Based on the provided context, the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for the study about tracking and mapping the plant species Rhododendron arboreum in the Himalayas are not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that the data used in this study is related to the ecological and bioclimatic observations of the target species and its occurrence, which is likely derived from satellite-based remote sensing data.

The study uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to establish a probability distribution model of the Rhododendron arboreum. CNN is a type of deep learning-based model for processing multidimensional data that follows a grid pattern, and it is composed of three layers or building blocks: convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers. Feature extraction is conducted using the first two layers, and mapping the extracted features to the output is conducted by the third layer.

The data used in this study is likely obtained from satellite-based remote sensing observations, as the study mentions the use of "several ecological and bioclimatic satellite-based observations" to establish the probability distribution of the target species. However, the specific sources or methods for collecting this data are not provided in the context.

Therefore, while it can be inferred that the data used in this study is derived from satellite-based remote sensing observations, the specific methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for this study are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
