The provided article does not give specific details about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that a high-performance computing system was used, which likely included graphics processing units (GPUs) or tensor processing units (TPUs) to handle the large amounts of data and complex computations required for deep learning. These types of hardware are commonly used for training deep learning models due to their ability to perform parallel processing, which significantly speeds up the training process compared to using a central processing unit (CPU) alone. The specific brand or model of the GPU or TPU used is not mentioned in the article.
