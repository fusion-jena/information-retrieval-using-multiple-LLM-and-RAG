The provided context does not give specific details about the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, and scaling, but the text does not explicitly mention these. It only states that simple improvements over the baselines were achieved by applying data augmentation techniques.

However, the context does provide some insights into the methods used for improving the prototypical network approach. Some teams explored better ways to construct the negative prototype, while others applied transductive inference, adapting the learned feature space at test-time based on the newly-presented positive and negative events.

In summary, while the specific data augmentation techniques are not mentioned in the provided context, it is clear that participants used various methods to improve the prototypical network approach and achieve better results in their systems.
