The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is stated in the introduction where it mentions that a U-Net architecture, which is a particular implementation of a CNN, was used. The U-Net architecture is a CNN developed for biomedical image segmentation. The CNN architecture is then explained in more detail in the sections 2.5.1 and 2.5.2, where it describes the encoding and decoding paths of the network, which are composed of convolutional layers, ReLU activation functions, dropout layers, and max pooling layers. These are all components of a CNN architecture.
