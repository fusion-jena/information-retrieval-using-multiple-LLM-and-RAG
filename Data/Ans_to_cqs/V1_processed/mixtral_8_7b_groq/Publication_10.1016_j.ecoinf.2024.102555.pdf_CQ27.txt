The provided context does not contain information on the specific process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model. However, it does contain information about various studies that have used deep learning models for different applications in the field of ecological informatics.

In general, the process of deploying a trained deep learning model involves several steps, including model serialization, platform selection, and model integration with other systems.

Model serialization is the process of saving the trained model in a file format that can be easily loaded and used for making predictions. This is an important step in the model deployment process, as it allows the model to be easily shared and used by others.

Platform selection involves choosing the appropriate hardware and software platform for deploying the model. This may include selecting a cloud-based platform, such as Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure, or deploying the model on-premises using a local server or workstation.

Model integration involves integrating the deployed model with other systems, such as databases or web applications, to enable the model to be used in a production environment. This may involve creating APIs or other interfaces that allow the model to receive input data and return predictions.

Without more specific information from the provided context, it is not possible to answer this question fully. However, these are the general steps that are typically involved in deploying a trained deep learning model.
