The performance of the deep learning model in the study is evaluated using four specific metrics: the coefficient of determination (R2), mean bias error (MBE), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE).

The coefficient of determination (R2) quantifies the fraction of variance in the dependent variable accounted for by the independent variables in the model. It measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. The value of R2 ranges from 0 to 1, where a value closer to 1 indicates a better fit of the model to the data.

The mean bias error (MBE) primarily evaluates the model's average bias, assisting in identifying if any rectifications are required to address this bias. MBE identifies the mean deviation in the estimations, with a positive bias indicating a tendency to overestimate relative to the dataset values. A value of MBE closer to zero indicates better performance of the model.

The root mean square error (RMSE) calculates the discrepancies between predicted and true values. RMSE is the square root of the mean of the squared differences between the predicted and observed values. A lower value of RMSE indicates better performance of the model.

The mean absolute error (MAE) quantifies the average size of these prediction errors. MAE is the average of the absolute differences between the predicted and observed values. Like RMSE, a lower value of MAE indicates better performance of the model.

In summary, the performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using R2, MBE, RMSE, and MAE. Higher R2 scores, reduced RMSE and MAE scores, and MBE figures nearing zero indicate superior model performance.
