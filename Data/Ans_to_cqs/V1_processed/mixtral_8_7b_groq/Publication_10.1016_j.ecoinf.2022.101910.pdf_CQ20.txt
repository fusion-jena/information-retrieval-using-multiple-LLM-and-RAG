The context provided does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model in BirdNET. However, it is mentioned that BirdNET uses a deep neural network for the automated detection and classification of bird vocalizations. Training deep learning models, especially those involving audio data, typically requires significant computational power. Therefore, it is highly likely that BirdNET used hardware accelerators such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) to train their deep neural network. These hardware resources are well-suited for the parallel computations required in deep learning model training and can significantly reduce training times compared to using only CPUs.

In the context, there is a reference to a paper by Kahl et al., 2021, which might contain the specific information about the hardware resources used for training. However, without access to that paper, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer. Nonetheless, based on common practices in deep learning model training, it is reasonable to assume that BirdNET used GPUs or TPUs for training their deep neural network.
