Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. Hyperparameter optimization is an essential step in training machine learning models, and various techniques such as grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and more recently, automated machine learning platforms, are commonly used.

In the context of the paper "Zilong: a tool to identify empty images in camera-trap data" by Wei et al. (2020), the authors mention that they used YOLOv4 for animal detection but do not provide details about hyperparameter optimization. Similarly, in the paper "Image filtering and labelling assistant (ifla): expediting the analysis of data obtained from camera traps" by Xi et al. (2021), the authors propose a system for image filtering and labeling but do not discuss hyperparameter optimization.

In the context of the table showing the results of different trap configurations, the focus is on the performance of various pipeline configurations for image processing and not on the hyperparameter optimization of the underlying model.

Therefore, without additional information, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to the query. However, it is reasonable to assume that standard techniques for hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search or random search, were employed during the development of the models used in these studies.
