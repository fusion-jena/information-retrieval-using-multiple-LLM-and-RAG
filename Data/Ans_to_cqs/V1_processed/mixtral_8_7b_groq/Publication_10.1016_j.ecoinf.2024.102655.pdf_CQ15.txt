Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks and Recurrent Neural Networks. These models typically use optimization algorithms like SGD or Adam to minimize the loss function and improve the model's performance.

In addition, the context describes a study by Chen et al. (2023) that developed a machine learning model combining Artificial Bee Colony and Back Propagation Neural Network algorithms, achieving higher prediction accuracy compared to SVM and LSTM neural networks. This suggests that the researchers used optimization techniques in the training of the LSTM model, even though it is not explicitly stated.

Furthermore, the context describes a study by Wang et al. (2023) that applied variational mode decomposition to decompose water quality data into a series of relatively stable components, which were then used to train a LSTM neural network. This approach produced higher prediction accuracy compared to a single LSTM and Recurrent Neural Network. Again, optimization techniques would have been used in the training of the LSTM model, but it is not explicitly mentioned.

Therefore, while the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly stated in the provided context, it is reasonable to assume that optimization algorithms such as SGD or Adam were used during the training of the LSTM and Recurrent Neural Network models.
