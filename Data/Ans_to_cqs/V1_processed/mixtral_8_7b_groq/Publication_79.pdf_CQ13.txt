The provided context does not give specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model for hierarchical classification of Brazilian Savanna physiognomies. However, it does mention that deep learning techniques are used, and it gives some insight into the overall methodology of the study.

The study uses a hierarchical approach for semantic segmentation of satellite data to classify the Brazilian Savanna physiognomies. The process involves a sliding window approach and data augmentation techniques. The complete sample set is split into training and validation sets (70% and 30%, respectively). The deep learning model used is not explicitly named, but the context mentions the use of a multilayer convolutional decoder, which upscales features to the original spatial resolution, and skip-connections between encoder and decoder layers to preserve low-level details.

In the context of deep learning models, hyperparameters typically include learning rate, optimizer, number of layers, number of neurons, batch size, and the number of epochs. While the context does not provide specific details about these hyperparameters, it does mention that the analysis of the contribution of different spectral bands to improve network accuracy is not yet well explored. This suggests that the model might include some form of spectral band-specific configurations or hyperparameters.

In summary, while the provided context does not give explicit information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model for hierarchical classification of Brazilian Savanna physiognomies, it does provide insights into the overall methodology and the potential use of spectral band-specific configurations.
