The provided context discusses various techniques used to improve the understanding and utilization of deep learning models, particularly in the field of bioacoustics, but it does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. However, it does touch upon the importance of data diversity and access to labeled data in the bioacoustics field.

In general, addressing data bias in deep learning involves several preprocessing techniques, including:

1. **Stratified splitting**: This technique ensures that the train and test datasets are representative of the overall data distribution. It is particularly useful when the data is imbalanced or when there are categorical variables that need to be equally represented in both the train and test sets.

2. **Oversampling**: This technique involves increasing the frequency of the minority class in the dataset to match the majority class. This can help prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.

3. **Undersampling**: This technique involves reducing the frequency of the majority class in the dataset to match the minority class. This can help prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class, but it can also lead to loss of information.

4. **Diverse data collection**: This technique involves collecting data from various sources and ensuring that the data is representative of the real-world scenarios. This can help prevent the model from being biased towards specific sources or scenarios.

In the context of bioacoustics, the scarcity of labeled data and the differences in hardware characteristics and geographical origins of sounds can lead to data bias. To address this, the context suggests the use of active learning, which involves iteratively training new models with additional labeled data selected from their predictions. This can help reduce the extent of manual annotation and improve model performance.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, it does highlight the importance of data diversity and the use of active learning in the bioacoustics field.
