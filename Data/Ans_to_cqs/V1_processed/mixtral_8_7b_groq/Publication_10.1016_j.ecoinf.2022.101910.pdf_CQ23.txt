Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that some measures were taken to ensure the performance and applicability of the BirdNET deep learning model for bird vocalization detection and classification. However, the text does not explicitly mention the techniques used for enhancing the model's generalizability, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.

Here's a summary of the relevant information from the context:

1. The BirdNET model is a deep neural network developed for identifying over 3000 bird species from sound recordings (Kahl et al., 2021; Wood et al., 2021).
2. The authors adjusted three main settings in BirdNET: detection sensitivity, overlap of prediction segments, and minimum confidence threshold (Kahl et al., 2021).
3. They set the detection sensitivity to the highest allowed value (1.5), the overlap of prediction segments to 1.5 seconds, and the minimum confidence threshold to 0.4 (Kahl et al., 2021).
4. The low confidence threshold might increase recall and false positive rates, but the chosen value was similar to the one used by Kahl et al. (2021) when evaluating BirdNET accuracy on 984 bird species (value of 0.5).

Despite the lack of explicit information on generalizability techniques, some potential measures can be inferred from the context:

1. Diverse dataset: The BirdNET model is designed to identify over 3000 bird species, suggesting that the dataset used for training the model is diverse and covers a wide range of bird vocalizations. This diversity can contribute to the model's generalizability.
2. Model evaluation: The authors evaluated BirdNET accuracy on 984 bird species (Kahl et al., 2021), which might provide insights into the model's performance on a subset of the total species. However, it is not explicitly mentioned whether cross-validation or stratified splitting were used in this evaluation.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to enhance the BirdNET model's generalizability, such as cross-validation or stratified splitting, some inferences can be made based on the diverse dataset and model evaluation on a subset of species. However, without more information, it is difficult to definitively answer the query.
