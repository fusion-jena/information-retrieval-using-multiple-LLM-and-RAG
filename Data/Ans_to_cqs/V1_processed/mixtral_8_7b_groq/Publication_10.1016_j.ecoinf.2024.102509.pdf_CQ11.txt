I cannot provide a direct link to the data repository of the deep learning pipeline because none of the provided sources contain this information.

The first source, "World Agroforestry Centre, 2011. World Agroforestry Centre databases" is about the databases of the World Agroforestry Centre, but it does not provide information about a deep learning pipeline or its data repository.

The second source, "Yang, S., Feng, Q., Liang, T., Liu, B., Zang, W., Xie, H., 2018. Modeling grassland above-ground biomass based on artificial neural network and remote sensing in the Three-River Headwaters Region. Remote Sens. Environ. 204, 448â€“455. <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2017.10.011>" is a research paper about modeling grassland above-ground biomass using an artificial neural network and remote sensing. While the paper uses a type of machine learning (neural networks), it does not mention deep learning or provide information about a data repository for a deep learning pipeline.

The third and fourth sources, "EcologicalInformatics80(2024)10250912" and "EcologicalInformatics80(2024)1025094| D. Datta et al." are not accessible and do not provide any information about a deep learning pipeline or its data repository.

Therefore, I cannot provide a link to the data repository of the deep learning pipeline.
