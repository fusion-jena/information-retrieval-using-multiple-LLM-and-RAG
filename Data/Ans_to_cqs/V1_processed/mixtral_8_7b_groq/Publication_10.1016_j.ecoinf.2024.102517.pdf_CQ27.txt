The context does not provide detailed information on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model was trained in a deep learning environment based on Python and Tensorflow â€“ GPU, specifically on an RTX 2080 Ti GPU using the Adam optimizer. The model was trained for 50 epochs, with one noisy bird sound signal per iteration.

Based on common deep learning practices, it can be inferred that after training the model, the trained model would have been saved or serialized to disk for later use. Model serialization is the process of saving the trained model's architecture, weights, and biases to disk, allowing it to be loaded and used for inference at a later time.

As for platform selection, the context does not provide information on where the trained model was deployed or how it was integrated into a larger system. However, it does mention that the deep learning model is larger in size and is more demanding of computational resources, implying that the model may have been deployed on a server or cloud-based platform with sufficient computational resources.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit information on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, it can be inferred that the model was saved or serialized to disk after training and may have been deployed on a server or cloud-based platform with sufficient computational resources.
