Based on the provided context, there are no specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling mentioned in the described deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) [16] and Multi-scale Orderless Pooling (MOP) [17] schemes have been used to make CNNs independent of the input image size and robust for diverse classification and recognition applications.

The described pipeline uses pre-trained VGGnet [24] and fine-tunes the weights of this deep network using the Benthoz15 dataset [23] which consists of expert-annotated and geo-referenced marine images from Australian seas. The activation vectors of the first fully connected layer of the pre-trained VGGnet are employed as feature representations.

It is also mentioned that the proposed framework is used for the automatic annotation of underwater images, specifically for coral reefs. The images are divided into mosaics and coral maps, as shown in Figure 4. The legend key for the coral maps is C for coral and NC for non-coral.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling, it does describe the use of spatial pyramid pooling and Multi-scale Orderless Pooling to make the CNNs independent of the input image size and robust for diverse classification and recognition applications.
