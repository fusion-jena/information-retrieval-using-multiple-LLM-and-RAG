The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly specified in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the model is a "self-supervised (red, green, blue (RGB) deep learning model" which suggests that it could be a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as CNNs are commonly used for image-based tasks such as RGB image processing.

The pipeline described in the context involves using Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) based unsupervised detection to generate initial training data for a deep learning model. This initial training data is then used to train a model in a self-supervised manner. After that, the model is retrained based on a small number of hand-annotated trees to create the full model.

The use of the term "self-supervised" implies that the model is initially trained using unlabeled data, and then subsequently fine-tuned using a smaller set of labeled data. This is a common approach in deep learning, particularly when labeled data is scarce. CNNs are often used in this context because of their ability to learn spatial hierarchies of features from image data, which makes them well-suited to tasks such as image segmentation and object detection.

Therefore, while the type of deep learning model is not explicitly stated, based on the context and the common use of CNNs for image-based tasks, it is reasonable to infer that a CNN is used in this pipeline.
