The deep learning pipeline used in the evaluation of the conservation status of unevaluated orchid species utilizes digitally available occurrence records as the primary data format. These occurrence records are converted into four groups of features, which are geographic, climatic, biome, and anthropogenic.

The geographic features are derived from the mean latitude and longitude, longitudinal and latitudinal range, extent of occurrence (EOO), area of occupancy (AOO), number of locations (sensu IUCN), and occurrence records. The climatic features are based on the mean of 19 bioclim variables. The biome features involve the presence in 14 biomes, while the anthropogenic features are based on the mean Human Footprint Index.

These features are likely represented in a structured format such as CSV or a database table, where each row corresponds to a unique occurrence record, and the columns represent the different features. The use of structured data formats allows for easier data manipulation, preprocessing, and analysis in the deep learning pipeline.

It is important to note that the deep learning pipeline does not involve image, audio, or video data formats, which are commonly used in other deep learning applications such as computer vision and natural language processing. Instead, the pipeline focuses on extracting meaningful features from the occurrence records and using them to predict the conservation status of orchid species.

Another notable aspect of the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is the consideration of data quality and sampling bias. The pipeline uses occurrence records with an IUCN Red List (RL) assessment, ensuring that the data used for training and testing the model is of high quality and relevance. Additionally, the pipeline addresses the issue of sampling bias by randomly splitting the data set into a training set and a test set and performing cross-validation to quantify the average validation cross-entropy loss and accuracy.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline used in the evaluation of the conservation status of unevaluated orchid species utilizes structured data formats such as CSV, representing four groups of features derived from digitally available occurrence records. The pipeline focuses on addressing data quality and sampling bias issues to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the model's predictions.
