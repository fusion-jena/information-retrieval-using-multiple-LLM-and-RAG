Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline, such as a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket link. The context consists of several academic papers and their metadata, which do not contain any information regarding a code repository for a deep learning pipeline.

The first piece of context is a paper titled "Assessing the impacts of land use and climate change on ecosystem services: A review" by H. Gharechaee et al. published in the journal Ecological Informatics in 2024. The metadata includes the authors' affiliations and various statistical data related to the paper.

The second piece of context is another paper by H. Gharechaee et al. titled "Evaluating the effects of climate change and land use change on the distribution of medicinal and aromatic plants in the north of Iran" published in the same journal.

The third piece of context is a paper by Williams titled "Random forests" published in the book "Data Mining with Rattle and R" in 2011. This paper discusses the random forest algorithm for machine learning.

The fourth piece of context is a paper by Yousefzadeh and Ali titled "Middle East: The dilemma of oil, water, and food" published in 2022. This paper discusses the challenges facing the Middle East regarding oil, water, and food resources.

The fifth piece of context is a paper by Xiao et al. titled "Tidal groundwater flow and its ecological effects in a brackish marsh at the mouth of a large sub-tropical river" published in the Journal of Hydrology in 2017. This paper discusses the impact of tidal groundwater flow on the ecology of a brackish marsh.

The sixth piece of context is a paper by Xu et al. titled "Impacts of land use/land cover patterns on groundwater quality in the Guanzhong Basin of Northwest China" published in the journal Geocarto International in 2022. This paper discusses the impact of land use patterns on groundwater quality.

Therefore, I cannot provide the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline as it is not mentioned in the given context.
