The pieces of context provided do not directly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, they do discuss the use of deep learning in water quality management and lake eutrophication, which implies the use of numerical data.

In the paper "Applications of deep learning in water quality management: A state-of-the-art review" by Wai et al. (2022), the authors discuss various deep learning models used for water quality prediction, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, gated recurrent units (GRUs), and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These models typically require numerical data in the form of time series or spatial data.

In the paper "Evaluate method and classification standard on lake eutrophication" by Wang and Liu (2002), the authors discuss the use of chlorophyll a concentration (Chl a) as an indicator of lake eutrophication. Chl a is a numerical variable that can be measured using sensors or extracted from satellite images. Therefore, it is likely that the deep learning models used in water quality management and lake eutrophication studies use numerical data in the form of CSV files or similar formats.

However, the papers do not explicitly mention the use of other data formats such as images, audio, or video. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query based on the provided context.
