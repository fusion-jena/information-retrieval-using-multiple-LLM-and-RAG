The provided context does not give information about which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. The text focuses on the study area, data types and sources used in the study, and some related research. It does not mention any cloud platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform in relation to the deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
