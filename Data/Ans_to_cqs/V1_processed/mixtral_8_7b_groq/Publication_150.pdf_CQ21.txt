Based on the provided context, there is no information about specific postprocessing steps such as saliency map generation or model interpretation techniques applied after model training. However, there is information about the calculation of certain metrics and the creation of a confusion matrix for the InceptionV3 model.

After training the models, the researchers calculated the Top-1, Top-2, Top-3, Top-4, and Top-5 accuracies for each model. These metrics represent the percentage of images for which the true class appeared among the top n predicted classes. Additionally, macro recall and macro precision were calculated for each model. Macro recall is the average of the recall values for all classes, while macro precision is the average of the precision values for all classes.

For the InceptionV3 model, a confusion matrix was created to show the number of test images for each prediction. A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification model by comparing the true classes with the predicted classes. Each row of the matrix represents the instances in an actual class, while each column represents the instances in a predicted class. The entry in the i-th row and j-th column is the number of instances in the actual class i and predicted class j.

In summary, the postprocessing steps mentioned in the provided context include the calculation of several metrics (Top-1, Top-2, Top-3, Top-4, Top-5 accuracy, macro recall, and macro precision) and the creation of a confusion matrix for the InceptionV3 model. There is no information about other postprocessing techniques such as saliency map generation or model interpretation methods.
