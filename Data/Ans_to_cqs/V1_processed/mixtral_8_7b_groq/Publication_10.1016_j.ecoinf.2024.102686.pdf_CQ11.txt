Based on the provided context, there is no direct link to a data repository for a deep learning pipeline. However, the context does provide several data resources and papers that have used various data science and machine learning techniques.

The following resources could be used to create a deep learning pipeline for geospatial data:

1. Resource and Environment Science Data Center (<http://www.resdc.cn>): This website provides a range of data related to China's environment and resources, including meteorological, land use, and soil data.
2. National Meteorological Science Data Center (<http://data.cma.cn>): This website offers a variety of meteorological data, including historical climate data.
3. Harmonized World Soil Database (<https://www.fao.org/soils-portal/data-hub>): This resource provides global soil data, which can be used for various applications, such as land use and agriculture.
4. Geospatial Data Cloud (<http://www.gscloud.cn/>): This website offers a wide range of geospatial data, including DEM, slope, and vegetation data.

These data repositories can be used to create a deep learning pipeline for various applications, such as predicting climate patterns, land use changes, or soil erosion.

Additionally, the following papers have used data science and machine learning techniques for geospatial data analysis:

1. Li et al. (2016) used a variety of data sources and machine learning techniques for geospatial big data handling.
2. Li et al. (2021) analyzed the coupling coordination degree of production, living, and ecological spaces in the Yellow River Basin using data science techniques.
3. Li et al. (2023) studied the spatiotemporal patterns of human activity intensity and its impact on the environment using machine learning algorithms.

These papers demonstrate the potential of data science and machine learning techniques for geospatial data analysis.

In summary, while there is no direct link to a data repository for a deep learning pipeline, the provided context offers several data resources and examples of using data science and machine learning techniques for geospatial data analysis. These resources can be used to create a deep learning pipeline for various applications, such as predicting climate patterns, land use changes, or soil erosion.
