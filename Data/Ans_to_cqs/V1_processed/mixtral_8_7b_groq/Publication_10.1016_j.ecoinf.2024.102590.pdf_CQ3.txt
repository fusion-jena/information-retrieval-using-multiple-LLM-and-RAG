The provided context does not discuss the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of random forests for land-cover classification in a study involving Landsat 8 data. The annotation techniques for deep learning models typically include:

1. Image-level classification: This is the simplest form of annotation, where an image is assigned a single label, denoting the dominant object class in the image.

2. Bounding box annotation: Here, a bounding box is drawn around each object of interest in an image. This technique is often used for object detection tasks, where the goal is to locate and classify objects within an image.

3. Semantic segmentation: In this method, each pixel in an image is assigned a class label, denoting the object to which the pixel belongs. Semantic segmentation is useful for tasks requiring pixel-level accuracy, such as scene understanding or autonomous driving.

4. Instance segmentation: This technique combines object detection and semantic segmentation, where each instance of an object is individually segmented and classified. Instance segmentation is helpful for counting and tracking objects in a scene.

The context provided focuses on the use of remote sensing data for land-cover classification using random forests, which is a machine learning technique rather than deep learning. Therefore, the context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
