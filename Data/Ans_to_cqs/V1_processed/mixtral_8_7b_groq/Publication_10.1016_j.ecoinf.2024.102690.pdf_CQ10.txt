Based on the provided context, there is no information given about a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link related to it, such as a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket link. The context focuses on ecological research, specifically about the Platalea minor waterbird species and its habitat in the PRD region. It discusses research methods, scenarios, and classifications of ecological corridors and sources. However, it does not mention any deep learning pipeline or code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested link.
