The context provided does not directly refer to a deep learning model and its measures for ensuring generalizability. However, it does mention some methods used in other studies related to water quality management and environmental pollution that can contribute to the answer.

In the study by Wai et al., 2022, they conducted a state-of-the-art review on applications of deep learning in water quality management. While they didn't explicitly mention the measures taken for ensuring generalizability, they highlighted the importance of using diverse datasets and various evaluation metrics for deep learning models.

In the study by Ouyang et al., 2023, they developed a prediction model for Freezing of Gait using Random Forest (RF) modeling. Although it is not deep learning, they did mention a method for ensuring generalizability. They randomly divided the dataset into two subsets: one for training and the other for validation. This approach, known as splitting or partitioning the dataset, is also commonly used in deep learning to ensure that the model can generalize well to unseen data.

In addition, some common measures for ensuring generalizability in deep learning include:

1. Diverse dataset: Using a dataset that covers a wide range of variations in the input space, which helps the model to learn better representations and avoid overfitting.
2. Cross-validation: A technique where the dataset is divided into multiple folds, and the model is trained and evaluated on different combinations of these folds. This helps to assess the model's performance on unseen data and reduce overfitting.
3. Stratified splitting: A method of partitioning the dataset that ensures a balanced distribution of classes or important variables in both the training and validation sets. This can help improve the model's ability to generalize, especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not directly mention the measures taken for ensuring generalizability in a deep learning model for environmental pollution or water quality management, it does suggest the importance of using diverse datasets and partitioning the dataset for model evaluation. Additionally, common measures for ensuring generalizability in deep learning include using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, and stratified splitting.
