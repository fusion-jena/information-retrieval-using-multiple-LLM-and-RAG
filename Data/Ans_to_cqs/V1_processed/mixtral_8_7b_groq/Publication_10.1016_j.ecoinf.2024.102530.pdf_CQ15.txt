The provided context does not give information about the optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, as the text focuses on a fuzzy logic-based system called Apis-FIS. The Apis-FIS system uses the fuzzy logic toolbox of MATLAB 2023b to implement fuzzy inference systems (FIS) models, and it does not involve deep learning or optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam.

The Apis-FIS model is a tree-based FIS that combines two input Prox-FIS and LCWT-FIS systems. The output of Apis-FIS has triangular and trapezoidal membership functions with five fuzzy sets for linguistic variables. The system is used to evaluate landscapes unit provision based on expert data and field survey data. The rules for the Apis-FIS subsystem are based on LCWTSuit and DistSuit variables, and they determine the ApisSuit variable's fuzzy set.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query about optimization techniques in the deep learning pipeline.
