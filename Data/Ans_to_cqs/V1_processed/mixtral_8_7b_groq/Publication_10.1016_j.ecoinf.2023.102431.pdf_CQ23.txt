The provided context does not directly mention the use of a deep learning model. Instead, it describes a method for discriminant analysis using linear discriminant analysis and logistic regression for species and sex classification. Therefore, I will answer the query based on the techniques used in this described method that could potentially contribute to ensuring the generalizability of a deep learning model.

1. Diverse dataset: The dataset includes track data from three different species (marten, fisher male, and fisher female) and a total of 367 tracks, providing a diverse dataset for the analysis.
2. Cross-validation: Although not explicitly mentioned, the use of a stepwise variable selection procedure with a p-value threshold of 0.05 can be seen as a form of implicit cross-validation. By iteratively selecting and evaluating variables based on their F-ratios, the method indirectly assesses the performance of the model on different subsets of the data.
3. Stratified splitting: The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test groups for species discrimination and sex discrimination. However, the context does not explicitly mention whether this splitting was done in a stratified manner. Stratified sampling ensures that each subset has a similar distribution of classes, which can help improve the generalizability of the model.

In summary, the described method includes the use of a diverse dataset, an implicit form of cross-validation, and dataset splitting. However, it does not explicitly mention the use of stratified splitting. To further ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, one could consider incorporating explicit cross-validation techniques, stratified sampling, and other methods such as data augmentation and regularization.
