The pieces of context provided do not specify which particular framework was used to build the deep learning model in the study conducted by Azedou et al. (2023). However, they do mention that the study involved the use of a deep neural network (DNN) for land cover/land use classification.

Deep learning models can be built using various frameworks, including TensorFlow and PyTorch. TensorFlow is an open-source platform for machine learning and deep learning developed by Google Brain Team. It provides a comprehensive ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML-powered applications. PyTorch, on the other hand, is an open-source machine learning library based on the Torch library, which is used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing. It is primarily developed by Facebook's AI Research lab.

Given the popularity and wide usage of both TensorFlow and PyTorch, it is highly likely that either of these frameworks was used to build the deep learning model in the study by Azedou et al. (2023). However, without explicit information provided in the context, it is not possible to give a definitive answer.
