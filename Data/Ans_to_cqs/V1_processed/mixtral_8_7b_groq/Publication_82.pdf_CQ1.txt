The context provided does not give specific information about how the raw data was collected for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. However, it does mention that the study used the PlantVillage dataset, which is a public dataset. Therefore, it can be inferred that the raw data was collected by the creators of the PlantVillage dataset, although the specific methods used for data collection are not mentioned in the provided context.

In general, there are various methods for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines, including but not limited to:

1. Surveys: Surveys can be used to collect data from a large number of people or organizations. For example, a survey could be used to collect data on people's opinions or behaviors.
2. Sensors: Sensors can be used to collect data from the environment or from physical objects. For example, sensors could be used to collect data on temperature, humidity, or motion.
3. Public datasets: Public datasets are datasets that are freely available for anyone to use. These datasets can be a valuable resource for deep learning, as they often contain a large amount of labeled data that can be used for training machine learning models.
4. Private datasets: Private datasets are datasets that are not publicly available. These datasets may be owned by a company or organization, and may require permission or payment to access.
5. Web scraping: Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting data from websites. This can be a useful way to collect large amounts of data from the internet.

It's important to note that the choice of data collection method will depend on the specific problem that the deep learning pipeline is being used to solve. For example, if the goal is to recognize images of plants, then a public dataset of plant images would be a suitable choice. However, if the goal is to predict people's opinions, then a survey may be a more appropriate data collection method.
