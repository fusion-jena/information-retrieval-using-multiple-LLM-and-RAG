The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for image quality classification in the context provided are specific to the Arctic wildlife monitoring project in Finnmark and Yamal. They are not one of the standard datasets commonly used in deep learning model training such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.

In this project, the training dataset for image quality classification was created using manual classifications of images from the Finnmark and Yamal sites. Specifically, ~15,00
