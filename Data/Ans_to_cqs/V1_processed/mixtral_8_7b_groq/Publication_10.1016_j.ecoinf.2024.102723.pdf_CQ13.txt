The provided context does not give specific details about the learning rate or the optimizer used in the deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of TensorFlow, a popular open-source platform for machine learning and deep learning. TensorFlow allows for a wide variety of options when it comes to hyperparameters such as learning rate and optimizer. Common optimizers in TensorFlow include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adagrad, Adadelta, Adam, and Adabound. The learning rate can be set as a constant value, or it can be dynamically adjusted using learning rate schedules or optimization methods like learning rate decay or learning rate range tests.

Moreover, the context discusses a study where the BBCH scale was re-labeled using only unique values during the training phase, leading to a significant improvement in terms of Mean Squared Error (MSE). This implies that some form of data preprocessing or data augmentation was applied, which can also be considered as hyperparameters.

In summary, while the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are not specified in the provided context, there is a wide range of hyperparameters available in TensorFlow, including learning rate and optimizer options. Additionally, data preprocessing techniques and data augmentation methods can also be considered as hyperparameters.
