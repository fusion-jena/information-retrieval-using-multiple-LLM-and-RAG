The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the description of the network architecture, which includes convolution kernel pooling layers, a fully connected layer, and a dropout layer. Additionally, the authors have mentioned using CNN for feature learning and comparing their proposed model with classic CNN model. The classic CNN model is used as a baseline for comparison, which further confirms the use of CNN in the pipeline.

Furthermore, the authors have used pre-trained CNN models with WT spectrum, HHT spectrum, and STFT spectrum as input. These models are constructed to extract 500 features from the Dense\_1 layer of each CNN. The use of these spectra as input and extracting features from the Dense\_1 layer is a common practice in CNN-based models.

Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
