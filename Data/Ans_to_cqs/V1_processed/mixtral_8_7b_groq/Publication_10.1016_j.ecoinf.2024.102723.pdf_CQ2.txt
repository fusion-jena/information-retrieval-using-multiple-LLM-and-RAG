The provided context does not contain specific information about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the pipeline likely involves the use of CSV files or similar structured data formats. This is because the context mentions the use of the WOFOST cropping systems model, which generates data on crop growth and development, and the use of this data in regression problems. CSV files are commonly used for structured data, such as time series data, which would be relevant for crop growth and development data. Additionally, the context mentions the use of the Agricultural Ontology, which is a structured vocabulary used to describe agricultural concepts and relationships, and could be used to structure and organize data in a CSV file or other structured format.

It's also worth noting that the context mentions the use of TensorFlow and Keras, which are open-source libraries for building and training deep learning models. These libraries can work with a variety of data formats, including images, audio, video, and structured data formats like CSV.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly state the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that the pipeline likely involves the use of structured data formats such as CSV, as well as potentially other data formats such as images, audio, and video.
