Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The texts discuss various methods and applications of ecological modeling, connectivity analysis, and scenario planning, but they do not provide details about the model training process or how the performance of these models is evaluated during training.

However, the context does mention three methods for comparing ecological service provisioning (ESPs) and ecosystem services importance assessment, as well as morphological spatial pattern analysis. These methods are evaluated based on the coefficient of variation (CV), standard deviation, and mean value of area. While these evaluations are performed after the models have been trained, they demonstrate a general approach to assessing model performance in an ecological context.

In summary, the provided context does not contain specific information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. Nonetheless, it is important to note that evaluating model performance during and after training is a crucial aspect of any modeling process. Common practices include monitoring training and validation loss, assessing model accuracy using metrics such as R-squared or mean absolute error, and employing cross-validation techniques to ensure robustness and generalizability.
