The provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context includes details about a study that used a deep learning-based model for recognizing endemic bird species, but it does not provide a link to the data repository used in the study. The study adopted a deep-learning-based model (Inception-ResNet-v2) to train and learn the features of 27 endemic bird species (source domain) and then transferred the learned features to a second target network to train a newly added dataset on endemic bird species (target domain). However, the context does not provide information about where the data used in the study is stored or how it can be accessed. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
