The text provides information on several metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models in the context of herbarium sheet image analysis. While it does not explicitly mention standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall, it does mention Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). These are all measures of the difference between predicted and actual values, with lower values indicating better performance.

In addition to these general metrics, the text mentions several metrics specific to the task of object detection and segmentation in herbarium sheet images. These include filled area, major/minor axis length, perimeter, solidity, diameter, aspect ratio, rectangularity, compactness, circularity, narrow factor, perimeter-diameter ratio, perimeter-length ratio, and width-ratio. These metrics provide information on the size, shape, and boundary of the detected objects, allowing for a detailed evaluation of the model's performance.

The text also mentions that the deep learning models were trained using an Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 1 × 10−4 and a binary cross-entropy loss function, as the task was a binary class problem (leaf or background). The models were trained for 100 epochs with a batch size of 3.

Overall, while the text does not explicitly mention accuracy, precision, or recall, it provides a detailed overview of the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models in the context of herbarium sheet image analysis. These metrics allow for a thorough evaluation of the models' ability to detect and segment objects in the images, providing valuable insights into the models' performance.
