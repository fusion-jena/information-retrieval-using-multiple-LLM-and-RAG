The provided context does not give specific information about how the raw data, in this case, images of molluscs, were collected for the deep learning pipeline. The methods for collecting raw data can vary widely depending on the specific application and context.

In the study, the authors used images of molluscs for training deep learning models to identify and classify them. These images were likely collected through a combination of methods such as surveys, sensors, and public datasets. Surveys could involve manually collecting images of molluscs in their natural habitats. Sensors could include underwater cameras or other imaging devices used to automatically capture images of molluscs. Public datasets could be sources of images of molluscs that are freely available for research purposes.

However, the context does not provide specific details about how the images were collected, so it is not possible to give a definitive answer to this question based on the provided information. It is important to note that the collection of raw data is a critical step in any deep learning pipeline, and the choice of data collection method will depend on the specific goals and constraints of the project.
