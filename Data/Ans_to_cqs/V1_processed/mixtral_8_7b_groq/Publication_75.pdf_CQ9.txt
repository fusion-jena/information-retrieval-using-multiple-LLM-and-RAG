The context mainly focuses on the description of the Canadian dataset, which is publicly available at <https://inspection.canada.gc.ca/food-safety-risk-management/food-recall-warnings/industry/2018/eng/138972>, but it does not specify if it is hosted on any of the mentioned repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
