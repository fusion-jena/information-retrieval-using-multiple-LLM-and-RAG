I'm sorry for any confusion, but the provided context does not include information about the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline. The context discusses various machine learning models and approaches used for predicting forest canopy cover, such as deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN), random forests (RF), support vector machines (SVM), XGBoost, and LightGBM. However, it does not specify any particular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, which are commonly used for training deep learning models in computer vision tasks. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
