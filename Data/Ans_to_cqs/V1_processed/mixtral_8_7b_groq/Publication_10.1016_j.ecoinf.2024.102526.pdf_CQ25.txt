The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is used for detecting and identifying organisms in marine imagery. This is evident from the statement that artificial intelligence tools are being trialled and deployed for this purpose, and that images and annotations are reused as training data for these models.

The specific deep learning task (classification, segmentation, detection) cannot be determined from the provided context. However, the terms "identify" and "classify" are used interchangeably in the context, which suggests that the deep learning model is used for taxonomic classification of organisms in marine imagery.

Furthermore, the context provides information on the importance of defining the target population in image capture for mitigating biases in the identification of organisms. This suggests that the deep learning model is used for identifying specific organisms or taxa in marine imagery, rather than for general image segmentation or object detection tasks.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is used for taxonomic classification of organisms in marine imagery, with the aim of detecting and identifying specific organisms or taxa in the images.
