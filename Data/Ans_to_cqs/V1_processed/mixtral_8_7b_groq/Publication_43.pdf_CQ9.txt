Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context includes details about the training dataset, such as the identification of image patches containing Ziziphus lotus shrubs and bare soil with sparse vegetation, as well as the distribution of these images for training and validating the CNN classifiers. However, it does not mention where the dataset or the deep learning pipeline is available for access.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query as it falls outside the information provided in the context. It is possible that the data repository is not publicly available or was not specified in the study. If further information is provided, I would be happy to revisit this question.
