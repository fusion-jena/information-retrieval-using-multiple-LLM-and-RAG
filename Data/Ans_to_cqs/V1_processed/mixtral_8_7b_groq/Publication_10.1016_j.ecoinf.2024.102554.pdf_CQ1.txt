The deep learning pipeline for water quality monitoring in the SMARTLAGOON project utilizes a crawling tool to collect raw data from specific NetCDF files. These files are sourced from two major space agencies, the European Space Agency (ESA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and contain historical and near real-time data on aquatic systems. The data is stored in NetCDF files, which are a set of software libraries and self-describing, machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data.

The crawling tool is designed to acquire satellite imagery for predefined geospatial coordinates from the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) onboard the Sentinel-3 satellites. The OLCI measures solar radiation reflected by the Earth in 21 spectral bands at a spatial resolution of 300 m. The focus on Sentinel-3-related products is due to their ability to provide daily data from the same world region around the same hour, which is essential for the development of a monitoring system.

The crawling tool collects vital parameters such as reflectance, Aerosol Optical Thickness (Kd940), and Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations. Chlorophyll-a is a pigment found in the chloroplasts of algae and higher plants, and its concentration is a key indicator of water quality. The tool collects Chlorophyll-a data using different algorithms, such as Chl_nn and Chl_nomc, and stores it in the NetCDF files.

In addition to the satellite data, the SMARTLAGOON project also utilizes in situ data sources for water quality monitoring. The in situ data sources include the CSIC-IEO and CARM, which provide sampling data starting from 2016 and 2016, respectively. The in situ data sources provide a valuable complement to the satellite data, as they allow for the collection of water quality data at the surface level and in specific locations.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline for water quality monitoring in the SMARTLAGOON project utilizes a crawling tool to collect satellite data from the OLCI instrument onboard the Sentinel-3 satellites. The crawling tool collects vital parameters such as reflectance, Aerosol Optical Thickness, and Chlorophyll-a concentrations using different algorithms. Additionally, the project utilizes in situ data sources, such as CSIC-IEO and CARM, to collect water quality data at the surface level and in specific locations.
