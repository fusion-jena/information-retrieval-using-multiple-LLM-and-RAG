I don't have enough information to determine the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. The provided context discusses the use of a classification dendrogram generated with a FIT pairwise comparison model, but it does not mention any deep learning models or their hyperparameters. Deep learning models typically have hyperparameters such as learning rate, optimizer, number of layers, and number of neurons per layer, but the specific values used in this case are not provided in the given text.
