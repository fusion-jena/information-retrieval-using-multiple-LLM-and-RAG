I couldn't find a specific code repository link in the provided context. The articles mentioned use deep learning techniques for various applications, such as identifying and counting wild animals in camera-trap images, recognizing wild animals and their actions in videos, and detecting red foxes using YOLOv4. However, they do not provide a link to the code repository. If you are interested in the specific implementation, I would recommend contacting the authors of the respective articles to request access to the code.
