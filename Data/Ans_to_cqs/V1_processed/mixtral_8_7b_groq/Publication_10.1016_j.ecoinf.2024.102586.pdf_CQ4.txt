I don't have the exact answer to your query regarding data augmentation techniques in the deep learning pipeline using the provided context. However, I can provide some insights based on the related concepts found in the texts.

The context focuses on climate change, biological invasions, and statistical methods for predicting invasive species' distributions. There is no direct mention of deep learning, data augmentation techniques, flipping, rotating, or scaling.

However, one of the sources, "spatialRF: easy spatial regression with random Forest" by Benito (2021), discusses the R package "spatialRF" for predicting species distributions using Random Forest, a machine learning algorithm. Although this is not deep learning, it is a related technique in the broader context of machine learning for ecological applications.

In machine learning, data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used for image data to increase the size of the training dataset and reduce overfitting. These techniques generate new samples by applying transformations to the existing data. For example, in image data, flipping horizontally or vertically creates a mirrored version of the original image, while rotating changes the image's orientation and scaling adjusts its size.

In the context of ecological applications, data augmentation techniques might be used to enhance the predictive capacity of models for invasive species distributions. However, the provided context does not contain specific examples of these techniques being applied in the deep learning pipeline for ecological data.
