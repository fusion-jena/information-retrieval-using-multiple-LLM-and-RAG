Based on the provided context, there is no information that specifies the platform used to deploy the deep learning model for rice disease identification. The source, Yang et al. (2023), mentions the development of a lightweight rice disease identification network based on attention mechanism and dynamic convolution, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
