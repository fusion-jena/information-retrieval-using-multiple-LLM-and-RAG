Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, such as through methods like grid search or random search. The text focuses on presenting the results of a study that analyzed a multifrequency acoustics dataset acquired from scientific echosounders in the West African waters using FDA (Factorial Design Analysis) with and without the incorporation of spatial dimensions.

The results include various evaluation metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and R2 (Coefficient of Determination) for both train and test datasets. However, the process of hyperparameter optimization is not discussed.

It is essential to optimize hyperparameters to enhance the performance of a model. Grid search and random search are common methods for hyperparameter optimization. Grid search involves creating a grid of hyperparameter values and testing the model with all possible combinations. In contrast, random search selects hyperparameter values at random, which can be more efficient than grid search.

Therefore, without further information, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized in this study.
