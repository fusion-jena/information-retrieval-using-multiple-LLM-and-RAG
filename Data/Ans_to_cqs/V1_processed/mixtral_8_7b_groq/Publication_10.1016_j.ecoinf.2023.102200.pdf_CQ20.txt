The context does not provide specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The papers discuss the methods and techniques used for training deep learning models for tasks such as wetlands classification, mangrove crown diameter measurement, and tree canopies segmentation in urban areas. However, they do not mention the specific hardware resources used for training these models. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query.
