The context provided does not give specific details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that PyTorch was used to build the model and it was trained on an Nvidia V100 GPU. After training, the model was likely serialized, which is the process of converting the model into a format that can be stored and loaded again. This is often necessary for deploying a model, as it allows the model to be used in different environments and on different hardware.

One common way to serialize a PyTorch model is to use the `torch.jit.save` function, which saves the model to a file in a format that can be loaded using the `torch.jit.load` function. This allows the model to be used in a variety of settings, including on mobile devices and embedded systems.

The context also mentions that the model was fine-tuned on the PAD Full and PAD Lite datasets, which suggests that the model may have been deployed in a setting where it was used to make predictions on images from these datasets. However, the specific details of how the model was deployed are not provided.

In addition, the context mentions that the models were tested under the same experiment setting and the same GPU to make comparisons between them fair. This suggests that the models may have been deployed in a similar way, such as by loading them into the same environment and running them on the same hardware.

Overall, while the context does not provide specific details about the process used to deploy the trained deep learning model, it does mention that the model was likely serialized and may have been deployed in a setting where it was used to make predictions on images from the PAD Full and PAD Lite datasets.
