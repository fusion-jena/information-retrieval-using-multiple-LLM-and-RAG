The provided context does not include information about a deep learning pipeline or a specific data repository link. The research by Tuoku et al. uses NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data from AVHRR sensors generated by the Global Inventory Monitoring and Modeling Studies (GIMMS). However, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link for this pipeline.

The context also mentions other studies by Shi et al. (2020) and Shi et al. (2021), but these studies do not provide a deep learning pipeline data repository link either.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline as it is not mentioned in the given context.
