The performance of the deep learning model in the study is evaluated using the overall accuracy metric. The models are trained and tested on different train-test set splits, including 80-20, 60-40, 50-50, 40-60, and 20-80, to ensure that the results are robust and not overfitted to a specific dataset. The overall accuracy is calculated as the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of samples. However, the study does not mention other metrics such as precision, recall, or F1 score. It is worth noting that using a single metric like accuracy might not always provide a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance, especially in imbalanced datasets. Therefore, it is recommended to use a combination of metrics to evaluate the model's performance.
