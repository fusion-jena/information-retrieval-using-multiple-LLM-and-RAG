Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, the context does provide information about the datasets and machine learning models used in the studies.

In Reichstein et al. (2019), the study used a dataset of various Earth system science variables, including soil moisture, pressure, precipitation, air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, global radiation, reflected radiation, atmospheric radiation, emitted radiation, and sensibly heat flux. The study used deep learning models to understand the processes in Earth system science, but there is no information about the data annotation techniques used.

In Ryu et al. (2012), the study used remote sensing measurements of evapotranspiration and upscaled them to 8-day mean daily-sums. The study used a dataset of various meteorological variables, but there is no information about the data annotation techniques used.

In Schwank et al. (2012), the study used L-band radiative properties of vine vegetation at the MELBEX III SMOS cal/val site. The study used a dataset of various radiation variables, but there is no information about the data annotation techniques used.

The machine learning models used in the studies include KNN, GP, TREE, RF, XGB, SVR, and MLP. The hyperparameters of each model were fine-tuned using GridSearchCV and five-fold cross-validation. However, there is no information about how the data was annotated for these models.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot provide specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation and instance segmentation are commonly used in computer vision tasks, but there is no evidence to suggest that they were used in these studies.
