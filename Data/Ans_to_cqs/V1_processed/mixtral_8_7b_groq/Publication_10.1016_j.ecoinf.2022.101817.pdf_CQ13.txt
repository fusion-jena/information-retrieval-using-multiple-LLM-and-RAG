The provided context does not give specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model is based on the VGG architecture, which suggests that the hyperparameters might be similar to those used in VGG models. Common hyperparameters for VGG models include a learning rate of 0.001, a momentum of 0.9, and a weight decay of 0.0005. The optimizer used in VGG models is usually Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). It is possible that the same or similar hyperparameters and optimizer were used in the model described in the context. However, without explicit information, this is only a hypothesis.
