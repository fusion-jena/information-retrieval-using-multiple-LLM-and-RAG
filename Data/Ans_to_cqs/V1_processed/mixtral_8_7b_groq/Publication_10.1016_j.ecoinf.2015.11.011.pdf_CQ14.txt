The text provided does not give information on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. There is no mention of methods such as grid search, random search, or any other optimization techniques. The text focuses on describing the use of Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) for classifying land cover in aerial images, and it explains the choice of the MRF basis for the smoothing function and the use of the quasi-binomial family for overdispersion. The text also describes the process of preprocessing, classifying, and fitting GAMs, but it does not provide information on the optimization of hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot answer this query without additional context.
