The data format used in the deep learning pipeline described in the given context is a single channel mel spectrogram of size 64 Ã— 384. This format is derived from audio data, as it visualizes three seconds of audio at a sampling rate of 48 kHz.

The pipeline involves the acquisition of large amounts of audio data, which is then pre-processed to generate visual representations of sound. Specifically, the audio data is converted into a mel spectrogram, which is a two-dimensional representation of the audio signal's spectral content. The mel spectrogram is then used as input to a deep neural network for training and inference.

Therefore, the data format used in this deep learning pipeline is a mel spectrogram, which is a visual representation of audio data. Other data formats such as image, video, or CSV are not mentioned in the given context.
