The provided context does not give explicit information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the raw data consists of color spectrograms of two-second durations, which are used as inputs for the deep learning model. 

Given that the study focuses on passive monitoring of bird communities, it is likely that the raw data was collected using audio recordings. These recordings could have been obtained through various methods such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. For instance, the authors mention the BirdNet application, which allows for the identification of more than 3000 bird species, indicating the availability of extensive public datasets related to bird sounds.

In addition, the authors mention the use of the UMAP algorithm for accountin for the inter- and intra-species acoustic diversity of a labeled dataset. This suggests that the labeled dataset used for training the deep learning model was created using manual annotation of audio recordings.

Overall, while the context does not provide explicit details on the data collection methods, it can be inferred that the raw data was obtained through audio recordings, which could have been collected through surveys, sensors, or public datasets.
