The provided context discusses the use of different NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) datasets for ecological research, but it does not directly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide some general techniques that are commonly used to address data bias in remote sensing data preprocessing, which might be applicable to the NDVI datasets discussed.

1. Stratified splitting: When splitting the data into training, validation, and testing sets, it is important to ensure that each set is representative of the overall data distribution. Stratified sampling ensures that each subset has the same proportion of classes as the original dataset. This can help prevent bias in the model's performance due to an unrepresentative sample.

2. Oversampling and undersampling: In cases where the dataset is imbalanced, with one class having significantly more samples than another, oversampling the minority class or undersampling the majority class can help balance the dataset. Oversampling can be done by creating synthetic samples of the minority class, while undersampling can be done randomly or using techniques like Tomek links to ensure that important samples are not discarded.

3. Diverse data collection: Collecting data from various sources, sensors, and times can help ensure that the dataset is representative of the real-world conditions. This can help reduce bias due to factors like sensor noise, atmospheric conditions, and seasonal variations.

4. Data augmentation: Techniques like rotation, scaling, and flipping can be used to artificially increase the size of the dataset, helping the model generalize better and reducing overfitting. These techniques can also help balance the dataset if one class has significantly more samples than another.

5. Preprocessing: Applying preprocessing techniques like normalization, standardization, and outlier removal can help ensure that the data is in a consistent format and that no single feature or sample has undue influence on the model's performance.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, diverse data collection, data augmentation, and preprocessing can help address data bias in remote sensing data preprocessing.
