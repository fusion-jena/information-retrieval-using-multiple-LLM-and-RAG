Based on the provided context, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images. The study focuses on fish classification by species using a residual neural network implemented in TensorFlow and pre-trained with the ImageNet dataset. Additionally, the pipeline involves processing historical images and making species predictions using the trained model on new image data. Therefore, the data format used in this deep learning pipeline is images.
