The provided context does not include information about the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. There is no mention of GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other code repositories. The context mainly focuses on the model used for simulating wildfire spread, its parameters, and its application to a real wildfire. Therefore, I am unable to provide the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline.
