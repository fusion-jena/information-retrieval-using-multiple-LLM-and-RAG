The provided context does not contain information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide a general explanation of some common data annotation techniques in the field of deep learning.

Data annotation is the process of labeling data so that machine learning algorithms can learn to make predictions or classifications. In the context of deep learning, data annotation is a crucial step in the development of computer vision models. Here are some common data annotation techniques used in deep learning:

1. **Image classification:** This is the simplest form of data annotation, where an image is labeled with a single class or category. For example, an image of a cat might be labeled as "cat."
2. **Object detection:** In object detection, a bounding box is drawn around each object of interest in an image, and the object is labeled with its class. For example, an image of a street scene might contain bounding boxes around cars, pedestrians, and bicycles, each labeled with its respective class.
3. **Instance segmentation:** In instance segmentation, each pixel in an image is labeled with the class of the object it belongs to. This is a more detailed form of annotation than object detection, as it provides a pixel-level mask for each object. For example, an image of a street scene might be annotated with pixel-level masks for each car, pedestrian, and bicycle.
4. **Semantic segmentation:** Semantic segmentation is similar to instance segmentation, but it does not differentiate between instances of the same class. Instead, it labels each pixel with the class of the object it belongs to, without distinguishing between different instances. For example, an image of a street scene might be annotated with semantic segmentation masks for roads, buildings, and vegetation.
5. **Keypoint annotation:** In keypoint annotation, key points or landmarks are identified and labeled in an image. For example, in facial keypoint annotation, the eyes, nose, and mouth are labeled with their respective coordinates.

These are just a few examples of data annotation techniques used in deep learning. The choice of annotation technique depends on the specific task and the desired level of detail in the annotations.
