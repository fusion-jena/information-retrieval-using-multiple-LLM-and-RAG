The provided context does not directly mention which frameworks are used to build deep learning models. However, it does discuss node-based programming and its use in visual programming languages. Both TensorFlow and PyTorch, two popular deep learning frameworks, provide node-based interfaces for building and visualizing deep learning models.

TensorFlow, developed by Google Brain, offers TensorBoard, a tool for visualizing model architecture, training metrics, and more. This tool uses a node-based interface to represent the computational graph of a TensorFlow model. Users can interact with the graph, making it easier to understand and optimize model architecture.

PyTorch, developed by Facebook's AI Research lab, also supports node-based programming through its TorchViz library. TorchViz provides a node-based visualization of computational graphs, similar to TensorBoard. It allows users to inspect and debug models, making deep learning more accessible to those without extensive programming expertise.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly name TensorFlow and PyTorch, these deep learning frameworks do support node-based programming for model visualization and debugging. This aligns with the principles of node-based programming discussed in the context, which emphasize the use of visual interfaces for constructing and understanding computational processes.
