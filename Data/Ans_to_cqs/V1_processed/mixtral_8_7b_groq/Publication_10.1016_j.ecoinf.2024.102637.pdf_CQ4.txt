Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling that were applied in the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the use of deep learning models for bird image and sound classification, as well as the development of a lightweight SIAlex model. It discusses the use of VGG-16 and ResNet networks for feature extraction and classification, and the application of cascading multiple activation functions to improve the model's nonlinear expression and gradient propagation.

However, it is important to note that data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in deep learning pipelines, particularly for image classification tasks. These techniques help increase the size and diversity of the training dataset, reducing overfitting and improving the model's generalization performance.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it is likely that such techniques were applied. Data augmentation is a standard practice in deep learning, particularly for image classification tasks.
