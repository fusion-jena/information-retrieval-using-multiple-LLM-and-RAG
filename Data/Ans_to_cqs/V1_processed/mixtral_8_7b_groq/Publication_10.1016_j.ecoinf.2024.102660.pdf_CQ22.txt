The performance of the deep learning model was evaluated using five metrics: Accuracy (A), Precision (P), Recall (R), F1-score (F1), and Intersection over Union (IOU). These metrics are commonly used in the field of machine learning to assess the effectiveness of a model.

Accuracy is a measure of the total number of correct predictions made by the model out of all the predictions. It is calculated as the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions.

Precision, on the other hand, measures the proportion of true positive predictions (i.e., the model correctly predicted the presence of water sun glint) out of all the positive predictions made by the model. It is calculated as the ratio of the number of true positive predictions to the total number of positive predictions.

Recall, also known as sensitivity, measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all the actual positive instances in the data. It is calculated as the ratio of the number of true positive predictions to the total number of actual positive instances.

The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, which provides a balanced assessment of both measures. It is calculated as 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall).

Intersection over Union (IOU) is a measure of the overlap between the predicted bounding box and the ground truth bounding box. It is calculated as the area of overlap between the two bounding boxes divided by the area of union of the two bounding boxes.

In this study, the proposed Res_AUNet network achieved an Accuracy of 98.02%, an F1-score of 83.67%, and an IOU of 74.73%, indicating its precision in detecting water sun glint in UAV water images. These results highlight the potential of the proposed method for effectively eliminating water sun glint and determining the optimal timing for UAV water image acquisition.
