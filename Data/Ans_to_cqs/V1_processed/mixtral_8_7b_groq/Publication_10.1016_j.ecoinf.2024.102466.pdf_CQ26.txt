The provided context discusses the use of deep learning techniques in wildlife monitoring, including bird species recognition, but it does not explicitly mention the strategies used to address data bias during preprocessing. However, it does mention some related concepts that can be used to infer possible preprocessing techniques for addressing data bias.

In the context, it is mentioned that some researchers have addressed the issue of imbalanced class recognition of animal species in camera-trap images using techniques such as oversampling and undersampling (Cunha et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2021). Oversampling is a technique that involves increasing the number of instances of the minority class in the dataset, while undersampling is a technique that involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class in the dataset. These techniques can help to balance the class distribution in the dataset and improve the performance of deep learning models.

Another related concept mentioned in the context is the use of diverse data collection strategies. According to the context, noise in the dataset can arise due to various reasons such as vandalism, animal damage, loss of power, or extreme weather. In complex environments, environmental clutter and ambiguities may also affect the bird detection dataset, resulting in a noisy dataset. To address these issues, it is important to collect diverse data that represents various scenarios and conditions. This can help to improve the robustness and generalizability of deep learning models.

Stratified splitting is another preprocessing technique that can be used to address data bias. Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets that maintain the same class distribution as the original dataset. This can help to ensure that each subset contains a representative sample of each class, and can improve the performance of deep learning models.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of preprocessing techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection to address data bias, it does mention related concepts that can be used to infer these techniques. These techniques can help to balance the class distribution in the dataset, improve the robustness and generalizability of deep learning models, and ensure that each subset contains a representative sample of each class.
