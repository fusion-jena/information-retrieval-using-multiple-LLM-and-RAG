The provided context discusses various deep learning models and their evaluation, but it does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training these models. However, some common preprocessing steps for deep learning models include normalization, scaling, and cleaning.

Normalization is the process of scaling numeric data to a specific range, often between 0 and 1. This can help the model converge during training and improve its performance. One common normalization technique is min-max scaling, which scales the data between a specific range using the minimum and maximum values of the features.

Scaling is similar to normalization, but it scales the data to a specific standard deviation, often 1. This can help the model learn the weights of the features more effectively. Standardization is a common scaling technique that scales the data to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

Cleaning is the process of removing or correcting invalid or missing data. This can include removing outliers, imputing missing values, or correcting errors in the data. Cleaning the data can help improve the model's performance and prevent it from learning incorrect patterns.

In the context of deep learning models for audio and image data, additional preprocessing steps may include feature extraction, such as converting time-series audio data to spectrograms or log-mel spectrograms. For image data, preprocessing steps may include resizing the images, augmenting the data with rotations or flips, and extracting features using a pre-trained model.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training deep learning models, common preprocessing steps include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. For audio and image data, additional preprocessing steps may include feature extraction and data augmentation.
