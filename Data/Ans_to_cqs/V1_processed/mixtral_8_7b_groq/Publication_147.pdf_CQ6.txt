Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, I can provide some general preprocessing steps that are commonly used when working with remote sensing data, which is the focus of the given text.

When working with remote sensing data, preprocessing steps typically include:

1. **Data acquisition**: Gathering the required data from sources like Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, or Google Earth Engine.

2. **Geometric correction**: Aligning the data with a standard reference system to ensure accurate spatial representation.

3. **Radiometric correction**: Adjusting the data to account for atmospheric effects, sensor characteristics, and other factors that can affect the brightness and color of the images.

4. **Data subsetting**: Selecting the region of interest from the acquired data.

5. **Data normalization**: Scaling the data to a common range or distribution to make it suitable for the deep learning model. This can involve techniques like min-max scaling or z-score normalization.
