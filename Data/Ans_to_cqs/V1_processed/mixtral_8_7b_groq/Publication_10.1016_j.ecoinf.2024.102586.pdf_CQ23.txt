Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, there are some details about the methodology used in the study that can give us some insights into the potential steps taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.

Firstly, the study used a dataset consisting of both native and alien species pools, which were then separated into native and alien specimens. The alien species belonged to different categories such as cultivated, casual, naturalized, and invasive. This diverse dataset could have helped to ensure that the model is not overfitting to a particular species or category of species.

Secondly, the study used a machine learning technique called Random Forest to calculate the relative importance of each predictor variable on both the response variables (i.e., richness and abundance). Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and aggregates their predictions to improve the accuracy and generalizability of the model.

Thirdly, the study used a cross-validation technique called bootstrapping to calculate the relative importance of each predictor variable. Bootstrapping involves randomly sampling the data with replacement and training the model on the sampled data. This technique helps to reduce the variance of the model and improve its generalizability.

Lastly, the study used a stratified splitting technique to separate the data into training and testing sets. Stratified splitting ensures that the distribution of the response variable is similar in both the training and testing sets, which can help to improve the generalizability of the model.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, there are some indications that these techniques may have been used to ensure the generalizability of the model. However, without further information, it is not possible to confirm this with certainty.
