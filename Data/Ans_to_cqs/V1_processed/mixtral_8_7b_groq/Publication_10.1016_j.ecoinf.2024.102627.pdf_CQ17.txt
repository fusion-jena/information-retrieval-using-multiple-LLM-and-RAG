The provided context does not contain specific information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline for the species assemblage predictor. However, it is mentioned that deep learning models are used to characterize complex relationships between species and their environment, and the ever-increasing volume of data requires adapted DL workflows. Regularization methods like dropout and L2 regularization are commonly used techniques to prevent overfitting in deep learning models.

Dropout is a regularization technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to make the model more robust and less prone to overfitting (Srivastava et al., 2014). L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the sum of the squares of the model's weights. This encourages the model to have smaller weights, which can help to reduce overfitting (Goodfellow et al., 2016).

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used for the species assemblage predictor, it is mentioned that deep learning models are used, and dropout and L2 regularization are common techniques to prevent overfitting in deep learning models.
