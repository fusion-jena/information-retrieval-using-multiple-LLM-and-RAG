Based on the provided context, there is no specific strategy mentioned for monitoring the model performance during the training phase. However, it is mentioned that the Generalized Additive Model (GAM) was used for segmentation and classification, and its performance was assessed after the classification process.

In section 2.5. Accuracy assessment, it is mentioned that the classification accuracy was assessed within the analysis regions for each image by selecting 100 random points using ArcGIS's random point generating utility and visually assessing the class at that point. A proportionally stratified sampling strategy was used to ensure that at least 10 points of classified herbaceous cover were assessed for accuracy at each site. The preliminary accuracies were determined to be similar for individual sites, so they were pooled across sites. Additionally, an extra 15 random points within herbaceous cover for the 2009 images were generated so that the total across sites was more than 50.

Therefore, while there is no explicit strategy mentioned for monitoring the model performance during training, the classification accuracy was assessed after the classification process, which provides insights into the model's performance. It is worth noting that monitoring the model performance during training can be crucial for identifying any issues early on and making necessary adjustments to improve the model's performance. However, the provided context does not mention any such strategy.
