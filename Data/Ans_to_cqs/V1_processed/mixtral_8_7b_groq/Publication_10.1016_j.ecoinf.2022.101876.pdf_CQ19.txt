The provided context does not explicitly mention which specific deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, were used to build the computer vision models. However, it does mention the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques for automating data processing tasks related to image review and analysis.

In the context, it is mentioned that MegaDetector, a state-of-the-art computer vision model, classifies objects in images as either an animal, human, or truck. MegaDetector is based on the Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) framework, which is an object detection algorithm. Faster R-CNN can be implemented using different deep learning frameworks, including TensorFlow and PyTorch.

Considering that MegaDetector is a state-of-the-art model and Faster R-CNN is a popular and well-established object detection algorithm, it is plausible to assume that either TensorFlow or PyTorch (or potentially both) were used to build the deep learning model. However, without more specific information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
