To deploy the trained deep learning model in GreenCam, a specific process was followed, which includes model serialization and platform selection. 

Firstly, the SegFormer model with the MiT-B1 encoder was trained on a server with an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 3090 GPU for 100 epochs using the AdamW optimizer, a cosine annealing schedule, and the Cross-Entropy loss function. The model was trained to measure photo GVI by semantic segmentation of different classes such as tree, lawn, shrub, flower, flat, sky, facility, and architecture. 

After training, the model was serialized, which is the process of saving the model's architecture, weights, and other necessary parameters into a file. Model serialization is an essential step in deploying a deep learning model as it allows the model to be saved and loaded easily, enabling it to be used in different environments and platforms. In this case, the trained SegFormer model was serialized, and the model file was saved for further deployment.

The serialized model was then deployed on a mobile device, which required selecting an appropriate platform. In this case, the platform selection was based on the mobile device's hardware specifications and resource constraints. The MiT-B1 encoder was chosen as the encoder of GVI learning to strike a balance between performance and efficiency, facilitating model deployment on resource-constrained mobile devices.

Therefore, the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model in GreenCam involved model serialization and platform selection. The trained SegFormer model was serialized, and the model file was saved for further deployment. The serialized model was then deployed on a mobile device, taking into account the mobile device's hardware specifications and resource constraints.
