Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses a study by Chen et al. (2020) that applied water quality parameters and atmospheric conditions as input variables for predicting dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration using traditional machine learning methods (SVR) and deep learning methods (LSTM). However, there is no mention of where the data used in the study is stored or made available for public access.

The context also provides a list of references related to the prediction of DO concentration using machine learning and deep learning methods. Some of these studies have used publicly available datasets, such as the one by Heddam et al. (2022b) that used a river dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. However, the study by Chen et al. (2020) is not included in the list of references provided, and there is no information available about the data repository used in their study.

Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to the query regarding the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study by Chen et al. (2020).
