The provided context does not include information about the code repository for the Phylogenetic Perspective Neural Network (PPNN) or any other specific deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot directly provide the GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket link to the code repository.

However, based on the context, it is clear that the Phylogenetic Perspective Neural Network (PPNN) is a novel deep learning approach for bird acoustic recognition, incorporating hierarchical multilevel labels for each bird and using a hierarchical semantic embedding framework. The authors conducted experiments on bird acoustic datasets and compared the results with current methods, demonstrating that PPNN outperforms them.

To get more information about the code repository, I would recommend looking at the reference paper's details, as it might provide a link to the code repository or contact information for the authors. Additionally, you can search for the authors' names or the paper's title on popular code-sharing platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.

In summary, the provided context does not contain the code repository link for the Phylogenetic Perspective Neural Network (PPNN), but you can search for it on code-sharing platforms or contact the authors for more information.
