Based on the provided context, specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not mentioned. The text focuses on the architecture and data processing aspects of the D-Mask R-CNN model for object detection and instance segmentation in RGB-D images.

However, the context does mention the use of pre-trained weights from the Microsoft COCO dataset for the region proposal network (RPN) classifier and mask head. This implies that the pre-trained weights were optimized using some form of optimization algorithm, but the specific algorithm is not provided.

Popular optimization algorithms for deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), RMSprop, and AdaGrad. The choice of optimization algorithm depends on factors such as the complexity of the model, the size and nature of the dataset, and the computational resources available.

In summary, while the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not mentioned in the provided context, it is likely that a standard optimization algorithm such as SGD or Adam was used to optimize the pre-trained weights from the Microsoft COCO dataset.
