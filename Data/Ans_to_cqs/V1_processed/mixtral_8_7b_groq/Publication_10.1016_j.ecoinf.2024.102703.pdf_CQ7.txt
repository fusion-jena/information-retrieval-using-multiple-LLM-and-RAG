Based on the provided context, the data was split into two sets for training and validating the backpropagation artificial neural network model. 

The first set consisted of 64 water samples and was utilized for model calibration. This set was used to train the model by adjusting the weights and biases of the neurons to minimize the training error. The maximum training times were set to 10,000, and the training error was set to 0.001.

The second set of water samples was used for validation. The validation accuracy was assessed by calculating the coefficient of determination (R2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) between the measured and predicted TSI (Trophic State Index). The RMSE was determined using Eq. (6) in the context, which takes the square root of the sum of the squared differences between the measured and predicted TSI values divided by the number of samples.

Therefore, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training were model calibration and validation. The first set of data was used for model calibration, and the second set was used for validation. The validation accuracy was assessed using the R2 and RMSE metrics.
