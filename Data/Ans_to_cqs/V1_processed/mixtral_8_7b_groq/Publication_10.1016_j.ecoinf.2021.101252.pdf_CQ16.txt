The criteria used to determine when training is complete involves monitoring the model's validation performance, specifically looking for no increase in validation performance after a certain number of epochs. In the provided context, this threshold is set at 25 epochs. If no improvement in validation performance is observed for 25 consecutive epochs, the training process is stopped. This approach is based on the premise that the 'optimal' number of training epochs is the one that provides the best validation performance. 

The concept behind this method is that a model trained for too few epochs may not capture all relevant patterns in the data, reducing its predictive performance. On the other hand, a model trained for an excessive number of epochs might overfit, reducing its generality and ability to classify new data. 

Once the 'optimal' number of training epochs is determined, the performance of the model is evaluated using a 'final' test data set. This provides the best estimate of the predictive performance of the model. 

It's important to note that the choice of 25 epochs as a threshold is not definitive and can be adjusted according to the time resources available. Other thresholds could be considered based on the specific requirements and constraints of the modelling task. 

The provided context also mentions that for three case studies, candidate models were trained for 4 epochs using a specific accuracy metric. However, the criteria for determining when training is complete in these case studies are not explicitly stated. It can be inferred, given the general approach described in the context, that a similar criteria involving validation performance plateau was used, but this is not explicitly confirmed.
