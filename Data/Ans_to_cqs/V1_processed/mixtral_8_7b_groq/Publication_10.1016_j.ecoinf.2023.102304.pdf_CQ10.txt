I am unable to provide you with the specific code repository link of the deep learning pipeline you are looking for as it is not included in the provided context. However, the context does include several research papers and studies related to geospatial analysis, remote sensing, and vegetation cover. These studies use various methods and indices for analyzing data, but they do not mention the use of a deep learning pipeline.

If you are interested in finding a deep learning pipeline for geospatial analysis or remote sensing, I would recommend searching for repositories on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. You can search for repositories related to deep learning, remote sensing, and geospatial analysis to find a pipeline that suits your needs. Additionally, you can look for deep learning libraries and frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras, which may have pre-built models or examples for remote sensing or geospatial analysis.

I hope this information is helpful, and I apologize for not being able to provide you with the specific link you were looking for.
