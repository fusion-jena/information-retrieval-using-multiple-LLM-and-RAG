The data formats used in deep learning pipelines can vary depending on the specific application and the type of data being analyzed. Based on the provided context, the following data formats are used in deep learning pipelines:

1. Images: In several studies, images are used as the primary data format for deep learning. For instance, Liu and Abd-Elrahman (2018) used unmanned aerial systems (UAS) imagery for wetlands classification, while Marasigan et al. (2019) used airborne lidar data for mangrove crown diameter measurement. Kaartinen et al. (2012) used airborne laser scanning data for individual tree detection and extraction, and Kuenzer et al. (2011) used remote sensing data for mangrove ecosystems analysis. Moreover, Mohammadimanesh et al. (2019) used polarimetric SAR imagery for semantic segmentation.
2. Point Cloud Data: Point cloud data is another data format used in deep learning pipelines. Peng et al. (2021) used UAV-LiDAR data for tree height measurements in degraded tropical forests. Kaartinen et al. (2012) also used airborne laser scanning data, which is a type of point cloud data, for individual tree detection and extraction.
3. Video: Although not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, video data can also be used in deep learning pipelines. Video data can be analyzed using deep learning techniques for object detection, tracking, and segmentation.
4. CSV: While not commonly used in deep learning pipelines for image or video analysis, CSV files can be used to store and manipulate data used in deep learning models. For instance, Isin et al. (2016) used MRI-based brain tumor image segmentation using deep learning methods, where the data may have been stored in CSV files before being used in the deep learning pipeline.

In summary, the data formats used in deep learning pipelines include images, point cloud data, video, and CSV files. The specific data format used depends on the type of data being analyzed and the deep learning techniques being employed.
