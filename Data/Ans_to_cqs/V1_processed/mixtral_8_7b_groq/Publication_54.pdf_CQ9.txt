The provided context does not mention where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The sources [22], [23], [24], [25], [26] are surveys and reviews about various topics in deep learning and data analysis, but they do not provide any specific data repository. The paper [102976] describes a study on recognizing endemic bird species using deep learning models, but it does not specify where the data repository is located. The paper mentions that the presented work was implemented using TensorFlow libraries on a GPU workstation, but it does not provide information about the data repository. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
