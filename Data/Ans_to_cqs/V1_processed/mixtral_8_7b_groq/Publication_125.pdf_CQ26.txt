The provided context discusses various techniques related to deep learning model training, data augmentation, and different CNN architectures. However, it does not explicitly mention the strategies used to address data bias during preprocessing, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting is a technique that ensures each subset (e.g., training, validation, or testing) of the data has a similar distribution of classes as the original dataset. This method is useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets. Oversampling and undersampling are techniques that adjust the class distribution within the dataset by either duplicating instances from the minority class (oversampling) or removing instances from the majority class (undersampling). Diverse data collection refers to gathering data from various sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the problem space.

Since the provided context does not mention these techniques, it is not possible to answer this query without additional information.
