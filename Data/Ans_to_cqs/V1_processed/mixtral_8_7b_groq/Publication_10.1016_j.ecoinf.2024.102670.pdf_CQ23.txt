The text provided discusses a study that uses deep learning methods for mycelium length measurement but does not explicitly mention the techniques used to ensure the generalizability of the model. However, it does mention some methods that could indirectly contribute to the model's generalizability.

Firstly, the authors used a crowd-sourcing approach to obtain manual annotations, which could have provided a diverse dataset. This method involves non-expert users, which can lead to a wide variety of annotations, thus increasing the diversity of the dataset. A diverse dataset can help improve the model's performance and generalizability by exposing it to a wide range of patterns and variations.

Secondly, the authors used Lin’s Concordance Coefficient (ρc) to assess the agreement between the manual tracing and the automated method. This assessment helps to understand the reliability and accuracy of the model, which is crucial for its generalizability.

However, the text does not mention any cross-validation or stratified splitting techniques used to further ensure the model's generalizability. Cross-validation is a commonly used technique where the dataset is divided into multiple subsets, and the model is trained and tested on each subset. This method helps to assess the model's performance on unseen data and reduces overfitting, thereby improving the model's generalizability.

Stratified splitting is another technique used to ensure the model's generalizability, especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets. This technique involves dividing the dataset into subsets while preserving the class distribution, ensuring that each subset has a similar proportion of each class.

In conclusion, while the text provides some insights into the methods used to ensure the diversity of the dataset and the accuracy of the model, it does not explicitly mention the use of cross-validation or stratified splitting techniques to enhance the model's generalizability.
