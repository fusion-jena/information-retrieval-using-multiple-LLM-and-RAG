Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the data preprocessing steps applied before training the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that some data preprocessing steps, such as normalization or scaling, might have been performed as part of the data preparation process. This is because the text mentions that they applied data augmentation techniques to increase the number and variability of the training data. Commonly, data normalization or scaling is applied as a preprocessing step before data augmentation to ensure that the modifications made during data augmentation are consistent and do not introduce unexpected variability.

In addition, the context states that they compared different fully connected network architectures and explored up to three hidden layers with different numbers of neurons in each layer. This process might have included some form of data cleaning or preparation to ensure that the data was suitable for training the deep learning model.

To summarize, while the context does not explicitly mention the data preprocessing steps applied before training the deep learning model, it can be inferred that some preprocessing steps, such as normalization, scaling, or data cleaning, might have been performed as part of the data preparation process.
