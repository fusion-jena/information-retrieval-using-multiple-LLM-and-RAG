The text does not provide explicit information about which deep learning framework was used to build the model. However, it does mention that pre-trained weights from a ResNet-34 model were used, and ResNet models are typically implemented using deep learning libraries such as PyTorch or TensorFlow. Additionally, the text mentions the use of the WeightedRandomSampler function, which is a PyTorch function, suggesting that PyTorch may have been used as the deep learning framework. Without more specific information, it is not possible to give a definitive answer.
