The provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. There is no mention of GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other code repository hosting platforms. The context mainly focuses on LightGBM, a gradient boosting framework that uses tree-based learning algorithms, and its application in ecological informatics for estimating mangrove aboveground biomass and soil carbon stocks.

There are some details about the dataset used in the studies, such as remote sensing data from the Red River Delta Biosphere Reserve in Vietnam, but there is no reference to a deep learning pipeline or its code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
