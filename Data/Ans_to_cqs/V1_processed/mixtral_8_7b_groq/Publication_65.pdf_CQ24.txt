Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it is possible that such strategies were used but not explicitly mentioned in the text.

In the context provided, the focus is on the investigation of state-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods to detect trees in urban areas, specifically in the Cerrado biome with a high spatial resolution of 10 cm. Five state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, FCN, U-Net, SegNet, DeepLabV3+, and DDCN, were used and compared based on their number of parameters, training and inference time, and inference time per hectare.

The text does mention that all deep learning-based models were implemented using TensorFlow, a Python framework that allows efficient analysis and implementation of deep learning with Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). TensorFlow does provide options to control randomness, such as setting a random seed value for reproducibility.

Therefore, while the text does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it is possible that such strategies were employed using the capabilities of the TensorFlow framework.
