The provided context does not give information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The text focuses on the methodology used for sampling and creating the training datasets, as well as the spectral indices calculated for each collection. It mentions the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE), which is a cloud-based platform that provides access to petabytes of satellite imagery and geospatial data. GEE has the capability to perform computations on its servers, including training machine learning models. However, it does not specify whether it uses GPUs, TPUs, or other types of hardware for this task. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to accurately answer this query.
