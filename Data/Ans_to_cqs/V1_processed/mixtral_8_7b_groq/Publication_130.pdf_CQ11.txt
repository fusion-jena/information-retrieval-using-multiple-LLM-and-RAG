Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the use of deep learning for individual identification of birds, specifically the sociable weaver, great tit, and zebra finch. It explains how the collection of labeled images can be automated and how to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for re-identification. The authors also mention using RFID technology for data collection and refer to a Raspberry Pi setup available on GitHub. However, there is no information about the data repository link for the deep learning pipeline.
