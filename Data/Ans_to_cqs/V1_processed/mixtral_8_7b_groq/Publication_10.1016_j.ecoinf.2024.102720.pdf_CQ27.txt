The provided context does not contain information on the specific process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of a deep learning algorithm for strategic planning in a report from 1998. Therefore, it can be inferred that the organization had already started using deep learning algorithms for decision-making processes two decades ago.

Moreover, the context includes several recent publications on the application of data analysis and machine learning techniques in various fields such as soil science, environmental sustainability, and population research. These studies suggest that the organizations and researchers mentioned in the context are actively using data-driven approaches to analyze complex systems and make informed decisions.

However, the context does not provide information on the specific steps taken to deploy a deep learning model, such as model serialization, platform selection, or integration with existing systems. It is possible that the details of the model deployment process were not included in the provided abstracts or that the researchers and organizations have their own specific procedures for deploying deep learning models.

In summary, while the context indicates that deep learning algorithms are being used for strategic planning and data analysis, it does not provide specific information on the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model.
