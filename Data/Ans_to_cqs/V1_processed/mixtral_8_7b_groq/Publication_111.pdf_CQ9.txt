The data repository of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The context only mentions that the dataset used in the study is obtained from the Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency. It is possible that the data is available on the agency's website or through a specific data request process.

The study focuses on the comparison of statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models for predicting Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Significant Wave Height (SWH) using the dataset from the Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency. The deep learning model used in the study is a GRU-DNN model, which combines Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) with a regular neural network. The hyperparameters of the GRU-DNN model are tuned using a search space, and the model is trained and validated using a specific procedure.

The study does not mention any open-access data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF for the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is not possible to directly access the data and code used in the study from these repositories. However, the study is published in an open-access journal, and the figures and tables in the paper provide some insights into the data and methods used in the study.

It is important to note that data availability and sharing are crucial for reproducibility and transparency in research. While the study does not explicitly mention any open-access data repositories, it is possible that the authors have made the data and code available upon request or through a specific data sharing agreement. Therefore, it is recommended to contact the authors or the Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency for more information on the data availability and access.

Another possible way to access the data is to look for similar datasets on the open-access data repositories or the agency's website. There may be other studies or projects that have used similar datasets and have made them available on these platforms. However, it is important to ensure that the data is relevant and appropriate for the research question and analysis.

In summary, the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. It is recommended to contact the authors or the Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency for more information on the data availability and access. Additionally, it is possible to look for similar datasets on open-access data repositories or the agency's website.
