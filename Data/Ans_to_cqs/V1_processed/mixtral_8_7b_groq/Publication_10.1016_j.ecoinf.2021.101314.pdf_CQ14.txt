The text does not provide specific information on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. There is no mention of methods such as grid search, random search, or any other optimization techniques. The text does mention several hyperparameters that are used in the model, including thresholds on the size of the support of the output redescriptions and controls on the length and complexity of their queries. However, it does not specify how these hyperparameters are chosen or optimized. Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer this question.
