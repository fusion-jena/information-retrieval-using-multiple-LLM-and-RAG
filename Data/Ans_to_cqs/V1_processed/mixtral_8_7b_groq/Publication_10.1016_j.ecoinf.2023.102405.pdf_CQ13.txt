The specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the optimizer, are not explicitly provided in the given context. However, we can infer some details about the model's structure and training process.

The model is an Attention-based ODE-GRU model (AODEGRU), which combines the gating mechanisms of Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) with Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) and attention mechanisms. The ODE function, which controls the continuous dynamics of the hidden state over time, is problem-specific and designed according to the model's requirements.

The training process consists of several steps, including defining a loss function and an optimizer, initializing lists to store training loss and accuracy for each epoch, and starting a training loop. Within the loop, the model processes mini-batches of data, shuffling the training data before splitting it into mini-batches. At each time step within the input sequence, the model calculates the reset and update gates, new memory content, and the hidden state.

The context also includes references to theorems related to attention scores and hidden state calculations, but these do not directly relate to hyperparameters.

To provide a complete answer, one would need more specific information about the model's implementation, such as the type of optimizer used (e.g., Adam, SGD), the learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and any regularization techniques applied.
