The purpose of the deep learning model used in the study is to predict the propagation time of drought and understand the influencing factors. Specifically, it is a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, referred to as CNN-LSTM or C-L.

The CNN component of the model is used for feature extraction from input data, taking advantage of its ability to effectively capture spatial patterns. The LSTM component, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), is used to model the temporal dynamics of the extracted features, as it is particularly suited for handling sequential data.

The CNN-LSTM model is designed to predict drought propagation time while considering various influencing factors, such as meteorological conditions, land use, and land cover. The model is trained and tested using a comprehensive dataset spanning from January 1950 to December 2020, which is divided into forty-two distinct datasets using a sliding window method.

The primary goal of this deep learning model is to enhance the understanding of drought propagation and its relationship with various factors. By employing the CNN-LSTM model, the study aims to improve prediction accuracy and robustness compared to using a standalone CNN model. The results indicate that the CNN-LSTM model performs better in handling the complexity of drought propagation time and the relationship between influencing factors.
