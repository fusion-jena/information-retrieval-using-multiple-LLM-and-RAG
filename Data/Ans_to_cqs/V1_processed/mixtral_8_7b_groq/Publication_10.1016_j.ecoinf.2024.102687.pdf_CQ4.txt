The provided context does not directly mention the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of supervised-based methods that rely on data augmentation to create image pairs for training tasks.

In general, data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include flipping, rotating, and scaling. Flipping involves creating a mirrored image of the original input, either horizontally or vertically. Rotation involves rotating the original input by a certain degree, while scaling involves changing the size of the original input. These techniques are used to increase the size of the training dataset and improve the model's ability to generalize.

In the context of the query, the supervised-based methods that rely on data augmentation use these techniques to create image pairs that can be used to build training tasks. For example, a pair of images could be created by flipping an original image horizontally, and then using the original and flipped images as a positive pair for training. Alternatively, a pair of images could be created by rotating the original image by a certain degree, and then using the original and rotated images as a positive pair for training.

It's worth noting that the context also mentions the use of clustering-based methods that use pseudo-labels generated by a clustering algorithm to build training tasks. While this method does not directly involve data augmentation, it can suffer from label inconsistency or limited diversity, which can impact the performance of the meta-learning algorithm.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it does mention the use of supervised-based methods that rely on data augmentation to create image pairs for training tasks. Common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, and scaling.
