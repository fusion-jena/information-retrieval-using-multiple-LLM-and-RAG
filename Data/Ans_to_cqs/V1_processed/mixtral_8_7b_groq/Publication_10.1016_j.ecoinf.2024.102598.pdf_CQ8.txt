Based on the provided context, there is no information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The context includes CRediT authorship contribution statements and Ecological Informatics articles by M.S. Sarkar et al., but none of them mention the location of the code repository. It could be on GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or another platform, but the information is not provided in the context. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
