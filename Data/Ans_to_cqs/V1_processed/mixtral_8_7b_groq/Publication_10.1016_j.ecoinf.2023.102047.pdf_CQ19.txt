The deep learning model in question is built using the TensorFlow framework, specifically the TensorFlow-GPU version 2.4.1. This version of TensorFlow was used in conjunction with a Python environment of version 3.7.10, CUDA Toolkit version 10.1.243, and Cudnn version 7.6.5. Additionally, the TensorFlow Object Detection API was utilized to set up the model configuration and download the pre-trained EfficientDet-D7 model weight.

The EfficientDet framework, which serves as the backbone of the proposed detector-2, is also built on top of TensorFlow. The EfficientDet framework is well-optimized for input image sizes of 512, 640, 768, 896, 1024, 1280, 1280, and 1536 for the family network EfficientDet-D0 to EfficientDet-D7, respectively. These optimized image sizes achieved the highest accuracy on the ImageNet dataset.

Therefore, it can be concluded that the TensorFlow framework was exclusively used to build the deep learning model in question.
