The criteria used to determine when training is complete in the context provided is not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred that the training of the Support Vector Machine for Regression (SVMR) model is completed by selecting parameter values based on the Root Mean Square Error of Cross-Validation (RMSEcv) values. This implies that the model training process involves tuning the parameters C, epsilon p, and gamma g of the epsilon-SVR model with a Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) kernel to achieve the best accuracy. The best combination of parameters is likely selected based on the performance on a validation set, but the specific stopping criteria are not provided. It could be that the training stops when the RMSEcv value reaches a minimum, or when a pre-determined number of iterations or epochs has been reached. In general, the choice of stopping criteria depends on the specific problem and dataset, and can include monitoring the performance on a validation set, the gradient of the loss function, or the magnitude of the weights.
