The provided context does not include information about deep learning pipelines or the use of strategies to handle randomness, such as setting a random seed value. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.

However, I can provide some general information about handling randomness in machine learning pipelines, including deep learning.

In machine learning, randomness can be introduced at various stages, such as data splitting, feature selection, and model initialization. To ensure reproducibility and comparability of results, it is essential to control randomness by setting a seed value. A seed value is an initial number that is used to generate a sequence of random numbers. By setting a seed value, the same sequence of random numbers will be generated every time the code is run, ensuring consistent results.

Deep learning pipelines can also benefit from controlling randomness. For example, when training a deep learning model, the weights and biases of the model are initialized with random values. By setting a seed value, the same initial weights and biases will be used every time the model is trained, which can help to ensure that the training process is reproducible.

In addition to setting a seed value, other strategies can be employed to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines. For example, techniques such as cross-validation and ensemble methods can help to reduce the impact of randomness on model performance. Cross-validation involves dividing the data into multiple folds and training the model on each fold, which can help to reduce overfitting and improve generalization. Ensemble methods involve combining the predictions of multiple models, which can help to reduce the variance and improve the robustness of the predictions.

Overall, while the provided context does not include specific information about handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, it is an essential consideration in machine learning and can be addressed through strategies such as setting a seed value, cross-validation, and ensemble methods.
