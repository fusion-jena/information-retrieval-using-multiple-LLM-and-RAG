Based on the provided context, the specific criteria used to determine when the training phase is complete for the algorithm in question is not explicitly mentioned. However, it is mentioned that the algorithm includes two steps: training and prediction, and that in the training phase, certain parameters were defined such as the learning rate (0.001), batch size (1,000), number of interactions (7,000), and inputs for classification were the spectral data acquired from training samples of spectral bands defined based on burned and non-burned areas.

It is also mentioned that the input of the training data was split into two, burned and non-burned, and that the Landsat-8 spectral bands used for the classification model of burned areas were chosen because of their sensitivity to fire events. Additionally, other indices such as NDVI, NBR, and delta NBR were tested.

In general, training of a machine learning model is considered complete when the model's performance on a validation set stops improving or when a validation loss plateau is reached. This indicates that the model has learned the underlying patterns in the training data and is not overfitting. However, the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete for this particular algorithm is not specified in the provided context.
