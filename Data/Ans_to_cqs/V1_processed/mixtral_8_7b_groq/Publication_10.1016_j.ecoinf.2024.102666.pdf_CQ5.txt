The provided context does not directly mention the use of standard deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does discuss the use of satellite images and in-situ measured data in the context of water quality analysis and atmospheric correction.

In the study by Men et al. (2022), the authors used HY-1C CZI images for atmospheric correction in the western Pacific region. Meng et al. (2024) used Sentinel-2 images for classification of inland lake water quality levels based on a convolutional neural network. Mishra et al. (2019) used satellite remote sensing data to measure cyanobacterial bloom magnitude. While these studies do not explicitly mention the use of standard deep learning datasets, they do demonstrate the application of deep learning techniques to remote sensing and water quality analysis.

The sensors used in these studies include MSI and OLCI, which have spectral channels in the blue, green, red, and near-infrared regions. These spectral bands can be used to analyze water quality parameters such as chlorophyll-a concentration, total suspended solids, and turbidity.

In addition to satellite images, the studies also mention the use of in-situ measured data. For example, Meng et al. (2024) used in-situ measured data to validate their classification model. Mishra et al. (2019) used in-situ measured data to develop a method for measuring cyanobacterial bloom magnitude.

Overall, while the provided context does not directly mention the use of standard deep learning datasets, it does demonstrate the application of deep learning techniques to remote sensing and water quality analysis using satellite images and in-situ measured data.
