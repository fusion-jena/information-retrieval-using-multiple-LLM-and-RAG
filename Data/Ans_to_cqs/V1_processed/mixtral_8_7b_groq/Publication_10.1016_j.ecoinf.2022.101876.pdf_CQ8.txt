Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text focuses on the evaluation of the performance of Microsoft AI for Earth's MegaDetector (V4.1) for processing wildlife camera trap images in an Arctic Alaska study. While it mentions the model's documentation, availability, and the developers' eagerness to help with running the model and interpreting results, it does not mention where the code repository is located. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information.
