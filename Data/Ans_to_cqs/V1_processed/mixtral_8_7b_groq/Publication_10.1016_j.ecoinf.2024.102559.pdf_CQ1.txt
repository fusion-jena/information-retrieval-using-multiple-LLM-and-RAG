The methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for environmental analysis and monitoring can include surveys, sensors, and public datasets. Researchers often use remotely sensed data, which involves collecting data from a distance using various types of sensors. This can include data from satellites, aircraft, or drones. For example, Ustin et al., 2002 discuss the use of hyperspectral remote sensing for invasive species detection and mapping, while Prasai et al., 2021 apply the Google Earth Engine Python API and NAIP imagery for land use and land cover classification. Additionally, Petty et al., 2012 use large-scale distributions of an exotic invasive pasture grass in North Australia to infer habitat suitability and spread patterns.

Public datasets are also commonly used in the deep learning pipeline for environmental analysis. For instance, the use of scikit-learn, a machine learning library for Python, is discussed in Blondel et al., 2011. Scikit-learn provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction via a consistent interface. Similarly, scikit-image, an image processing library for Python, is discussed in Van Der Walt et al., 2014.

In some cases, a combination of methods is used to collect raw data. For example, Cavender-Bares et al., 2022; Galaz Garc√≠a et al., 2023a; Tuia et al., 2022 highlight the potential of combining technologies to remotely collect large streams of environmental data with artificial intelligence techniques to accelerate and transform how we monitor biodiversity and evaluate the efficacy of restoration and conservation actions.

Overall, the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for environmental analysis and monitoring can vary depending on the specific application and research question. However, remotely sensed data, public datasets, and surveys are commonly used methods for collecting raw data in this field.
