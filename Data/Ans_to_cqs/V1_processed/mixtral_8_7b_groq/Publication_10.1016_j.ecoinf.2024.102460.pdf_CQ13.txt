The provided context does not give specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model (LSTM) for land use demand optimization. However, it is mentioned that the LSTM model is used for time series forecasting. Common hyperparameters for LSTM models include learning rate, optimizer, number of hidden layers, number of neurons in each layer, batch size, and the number of epochs. The learning rate determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function. The optimizer is a method that updates the model's weights based on the gradients. Some popular optimizers are Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop. The number of hidden layers and neurons can be adjusted to optimize the model's performance. Batch size is the number of training examples used in one iteration, and the number of epochs is the number of times the learning algorithm will work through the entire training dataset.

In the context of the LSTM-PLUS-FMOP framework, the focus is on the overall architecture and the integration of the LSTM model with the PLUS model and the FMOP model. The hyperparameters of the LSTM model are not explicitly discussed. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to the query based on the given context.
