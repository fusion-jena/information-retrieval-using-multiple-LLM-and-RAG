The provided context discusses the use of deep learning for semantic segmentation of canopy palm individuals in a Brazilian Amazon forest, but it does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, there are some general strategies that are commonly used to handle randomness in deep learning, which might have been employed in this study.

One common strategy is the use of a fixed random seed value. This ensures that the same initial random weights are used for each training run, which can help to ensure that the results are reproducible. The context does not mention the use of a fixed random seed value, but it is possible that one was used.

Another strategy is the use of data augmentation. This involves creating new training examples by applying random transformations to the existing examples. This can help to increase the size of the training set, and can also help to reduce overfitting by providing the model with a more diverse set of examples. The context mentions that the U-net model was trained using 24 images per batch, but it does not mention whether data augmentation was used.

Regularization techniques, such as dropout and weight decay, can also be used to handle randomness in deep learning. Dropout randomly sets a fraction of the activations in a layer to zero during training, which can help to prevent overfitting by reducing the co-adaptation of feature detectors. Weight decay adds a penalty term to the loss function that encourages the weights to be small, which can help to prevent overfitting by reducing the complexity of the model. The context does not mention the use of dropout or weight decay, but these techniques are commonly used in deep learning.

Finally, the use of early stopping can also help to handle randomness in deep learning. This involves monitoring the performance of the model on a validation set during training, and stopping the training process when the performance starts to degrade. This can help to prevent overfitting by stopping the training process before the model starts to memorize the training set. The context does not mention the use of early stopping, but it is a commonly used technique in deep learning.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategies used to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, there are several common strategies that might have been employed, such as the use of a fixed random seed value, data augmentation, regularization techniques, and early stopping.
