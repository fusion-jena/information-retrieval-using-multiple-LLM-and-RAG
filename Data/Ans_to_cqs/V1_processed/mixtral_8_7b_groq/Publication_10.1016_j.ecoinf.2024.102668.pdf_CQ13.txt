I'm sorry for any confusion, but the provided context does not include information about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model. The context consists of several studies and tables comparing audio recording systems and their characteristics, such as sampling frequency (FS) and gain, but it does not contain details about deep learning model hyperparameters. Hyperparameters like learning rate, optimizer, batch size, and number of epochs are crucial for training a deep learning model, but this information is not provided in the given context.
