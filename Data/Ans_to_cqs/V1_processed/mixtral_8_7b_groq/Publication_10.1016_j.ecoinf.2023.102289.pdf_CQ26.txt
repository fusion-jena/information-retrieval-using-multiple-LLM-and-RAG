The provided context does not directly discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the usage of a specific semantic segmentation model (deeplabv3 + Resnet269) and the importance of data thresholding in the LaDeco platform.

In the context of semantic segmentation and deep learning, data bias can arise from various sources, such as class imbalance, unrepresentative data, or measurement errors. To tackle these issues, several preprocessing techniques can be employed:

1. **Stratified splitting**: When dividing the dataset into training and testing sets, this method ensures that the distribution of classes remains similar in both sets. This is particularly useful when dealing with class-imbalanced data.

2. **Oversampling**: This technique involves increasing the number of instances from the minority class to balance the dataset. It can be done either by replicating existing instances or by generating synthetic samples using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).

3. **Undersampling**: Conversely, undersampling reduces the number of instances from the majority class to balance the dataset. However, this method may result in loss of valuable information.

4. **Diverse data collection**: Collecting data from various sources, domains, or conditions can help increase the diversity of the dataset, reducing the risk of overfitting and improving the model's generalization capabilities.

In the LaDeco platform, data thresholding is used to filter out negligible values. While this technique does not directly address data bias, it can help improve model performance by eliminating noisy or insignificant data points.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, several methods like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection can be employed to tackle data bias in deep learning pipelines, particularly in semantic segmentation tasks.
