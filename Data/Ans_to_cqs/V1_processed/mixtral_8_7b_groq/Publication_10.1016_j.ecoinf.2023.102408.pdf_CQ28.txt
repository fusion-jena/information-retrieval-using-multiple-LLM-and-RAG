The provided context does not contain information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The focus of the text is on comparing the performance of different algorithms, specifically Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine, in estimating Above Ground Biomass (AGB) using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data.

The text mentions the use of Artificial Neural Networks, which is a type of deep learning algorithm, but it does not provide any details about the platform where the model was implemented. Therefore, it is not possible to answer this question without additional information.
