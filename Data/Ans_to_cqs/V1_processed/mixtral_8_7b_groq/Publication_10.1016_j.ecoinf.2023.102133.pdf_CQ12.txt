The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of any specific deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or Transformers in the pipeline. However, it does mention the use of Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), which is a type of feedforward artificial neural network and not a deep learning model. MLP is a shallow neural network, and it consists of at least three layers of nodes: an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer.

The context also mentions the use of Random Forest (RF), which is an ensemble learning method and not a deep learning model. RF is a collection of decision trees, and it works by constructing multiple decision trees during the training phase and combining their outputs to improve the final result's overall accuracy and stability.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the deep learning models such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer are not used in the pipeline.
