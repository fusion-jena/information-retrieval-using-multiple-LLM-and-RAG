Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling in the described deep learning pipeline. The papers and abstracts provided focus on the use of machine learning and deep learning for various applications, such as land use and land cover classification, invasive species detection, and habitat suitability analysis. However, they do not go into detail about the specific data augmentation techniques used in their deep learning pipelines.

Data augmentation is a common technique used in deep learning to increase the size of the training set and improve model performance by applying various transformations to the existing data. These transformations can include flipping, rotating, scaling, and other geometric or photometric transformations. However, without more specific information from the provided context, it is not possible to answer this question definitively.

It is worth noting that the paper by Vali et al. (2020) provides a review of deep learning for land use and land cover classification based on hyperspectral and multispectral earth observation data. While they do not explicitly mention data augmentation techniques, they do discuss various data preprocessing techniques, such as noise reduction, dimensionality reduction, and feature extraction. Therefore, it is possible that data augmentation was used in some of the studies they reviewed, but this information is not provided in the paper.

In summary, based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling in the described deep learning pipeline. Therefore, we cannot provide a definitive answer to this question without more information.
