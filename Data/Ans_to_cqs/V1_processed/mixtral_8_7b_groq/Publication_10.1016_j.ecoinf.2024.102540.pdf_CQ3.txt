In the context provided, the data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline is polygon bounding box annotation. This is mentioned in the figure caption where it says "examples of images at 1280 Ã— 1280 pixels input resolution without (A) or with annotations (B) of alates using the polygon tool in the labeling section of the cloud-based Roboflow environment" (Dwyer and Nelson, 2022).

Polygon bounding box annotation is a type of instance segmentation where the object of interest is outlined using a polygon. This allows for more precise annotations compared to traditional bounding box annotations, which use rectangles to enclose the object. Polygon annotations are particularly useful for irregularly shaped objects or when the object's boundaries need to be accurately defined.

In the study described, the authors used this annotation technique to label alates (a stage in the life cycle of some insects) on sorghum leaves. These annotations were then used to train deep learning models, specifically the YOLOv5 family of models, to detect alates on sorghum leaves.

It's worth noting that other data annotation techniques can also be used in deep learning pipelines, such as traditional bounding box annotations, semantic segmentation, or even point annotations. The choice of annotation technique depends on the specific task and the desired level of precision in the annotations.
