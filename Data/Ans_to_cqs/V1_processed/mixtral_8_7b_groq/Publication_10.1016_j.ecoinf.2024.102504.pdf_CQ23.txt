The context provided does not contain specific information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a particular deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of deep learning models in predicting air quality in various studies.

In the study by Navares and Aznarte (2020), they developed a deep learning model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for predicting air quality in the Yangtze River Delta. While they do not explicitly mention how they ensured the generalizability of their model, they do mention that they used a comprehensive dataset that included various factors affecting air quality.

In the study by Gokul et al. (2023), they compared various machine learning models, including LSTM, for predicting PM2.5 levels in Hyderabad city. They found that the LSTM model outperformed others, but they do not mention how they ensured the generalizability of their model.

In the context of ensuring the generalizability of deep learning models, there are several measures that can be taken, such as:

1. Diverse dataset: Using a diverse dataset that includes data from different sources, locations, and conditions can help ensure that the model can generalize well to new data.
2. Cross-validation: Cross-validation is a technique where the dataset is split into multiple folds, and the model is trained and tested on different subsets of the data. This can help ensure that the model is not overfitting to the training data and can generalize well to new data.
3. Stratified splitting: Stratified splitting is a technique where the dataset is split in such a way that the distribution of the target variable is preserved in each subset. This can help ensure that the model is trained and tested on data that is representative of the overall distribution of the target variable.

Without specific information about the measures taken in the studies mentioned, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer. However, based on general practices in developing deep learning models, it is likely that some or all of these measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the models.
