The provided context does not give specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning (DL) model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text focuses on the process of training a DL model for fuel model retrieval using LiDAR point cloud data, and it mentions the use of a pre-trained model for semantic classification. However, it does not provide details about the hyperparameters chosen for the model. Therefore, I cannot give a precise answer to this query based on the given context.
