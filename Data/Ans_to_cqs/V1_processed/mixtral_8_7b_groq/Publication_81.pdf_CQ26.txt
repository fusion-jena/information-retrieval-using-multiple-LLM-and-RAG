The provided text discusses the development and implementation of the ESK model, which uses a deep learning approach to classify fish species based on DNA barcode sequences. However, it does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.

The ESK model's preprocessing steps include aligning DNA sequences to obtain the same length and converting them into numerical data using one-hot encoding. However, these steps do not directly address data bias.

The text does mention the use of Elastic Net for addressing overfitting in small datasets and providing sparse connections to save training time. While this technique does not directly address data bias, it can help improve the model's performance and prevent overfitting, which can indirectly contribute to reducing bias.

The text also discusses the selection of three fish families with a large number of species and obvious interspecific variation for the experiment. This diverse data collection can help ensure that the model is trained on a variety of fish species, potentially reducing bias.

In summary, while the provided text does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, it does discuss the use of diverse data collection and Elastic Net to improve the model's performance and potentially reduce bias. However, further information would be needed to provide a more comprehensive answer to this query.
