Based on the provided context, the specific purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated. However, we can make some educated guesses about its use based on the surrounding information.

The context discusses the development of a system for fire weather index (FWI) and fire fuel moisture code (FFMC) data layers with a spatial resolution of 1 Ã— 1 km. These data layers are used to predict and monitor the risk of wildfires. The authors mention that they used a nine-cell approach to smooth existing data inaccuracies within single grid cells, which suggests that the deep learning model may be used for data processing or feature engineering.

The context also provides some thresholds for FWI and FFMC values, such as "78 < 87" and "87 < 91". These thresholds may be used as part of the deep learning model's decision-making process, such as in a classification or segmentation task.

Additionally, the authors mention the potential future use of the system in a decision support system, which suggests that the deep learning model may be used for decision-making or prediction.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is likely that the deep learning model is used for data processing, feature engineering, and decision-making related to fire weather index and fire fuel moisture code data layers. However, without further information, it is not possible to definitively state the specific purpose of the deep learning model.
