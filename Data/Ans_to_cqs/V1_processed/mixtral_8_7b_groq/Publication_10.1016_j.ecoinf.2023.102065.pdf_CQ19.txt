The articles and abstracts provided do not explicitly mention which deep learning frameworks were used to build the models for avian diversity and bird species classification. However, they do mention the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and mel-spectrograms, which are techniques and representations that can be implemented in various deep learning frameworks.

Common deep learning frameworks for building CNNs and RNNs include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. TensorFlow is an open-source library developed by Google Brain Team, while PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library based on the Torch library developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano.

In the context of ecoacoustics and avian diversity, the article by Quinn et al. (2022) mentions using CNNs for soundscape classification, but it does not specify the deep learning framework used. Similarly, the article by LeBien et al. (2020) and other related works mentioned in the context use CNNs for bird species classification, but they do not explicitly mention the deep learning framework.

Therefore, while the specific deep learning frameworks used for building the models in the provided context are not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras were likely used, given their popularity and compatibility with CNNs and RNNs.
