The provided context discusses the use of face preprocessing adjustments and feature extraction enhancement for deep face recognition, but it does not explicitly mention techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does imply that certain preprocessing techniques can help improve model performance and reduce data bias.

For instance, the authors suggest that preprocessing the input instead of relying on data augmentation is a preferred way with significantly better results. This could be interpreted as a form of oversampling, where the original images are transformed during preprocessing to increase the size of the training set.

Additionally, the authors categorize face processing methods as "one-to-many augmentation" and "many-to-one normalization," which can be seen as techniques for addressing data bias. "One-to-many augmentation" methods generate many patches or images of the pose variability from a single image to enable deep networks to learn pose-invariant representations. This can be seen as a form of data augmentation, where the original images are transformed to increase the diversity of the training set.

On the other hand, "Many-to-one normalization" methods recover the canonical view of face images from images of a non-frontal view, then face recognition is performed as if it were under controlled conditions. This can be seen as a form of oversampling, where the original images are transformed during preprocessing to increase the size of the training set.

The authors also suggest that the face processing methods they discuss can be applied to individual BR ray recognition, which suggests that these techniques can be used for other types of data and tasks.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, it does suggest that preprocessing techniques such as input transformation, data augmentation, and oversampling can help improve model performance and reduce data bias in a deep learning pipeline.
