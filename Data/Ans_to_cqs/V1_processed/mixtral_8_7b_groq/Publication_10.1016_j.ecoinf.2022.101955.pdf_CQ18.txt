To monitor the model performance during training, the Control() function was utilized in the context of tuning parameters for each of the four machine learning algorithms. This function helped to manage and control the model runs, ensuring that the models were performing as expected throughout the training phase.

In the case of the ANN (Artificial Neural Networks) model, the Control() function was used to define the primary tuning parameters, specifically size and decay. These parameters helped to counter the effects of model overfitting, thereby ensuring that the model was not simply memorizing the training data but was instead learning to generalize from it.

For the kNN (k-Nearest Neighbors) model, the Control() function was likely used to define the number of iterations or runs for the model, as well as to manage the tuning methods used during training. This ensured that the model was not overfitting to the training data and was instead accurately classifying the LULC (Land Use and Land Cover) classes based on the distance between the k closest samples drawn from the training datasets.

In the case of the SVM (Support Vector Machines) model, the Control() function was used to manage the model runs and ensure that the model was performing as expected. The function may have been used to define the tuning parameters for the model, such as the cost parameter or the gamma parameter, which help to determine the optimal decision boundaries for separating two LULC classes.

Finally, for the RF (Random Forest) model, the Control() function was likely used to manage the model runs and ensure that the model was performing as expected. The function may have been used to define the number of trees (ntree) and the number of features in each split (mtry), which helped to ensure satisfactory model performance.

Overall, the Control() function was used to monitor the model performance during training for each of the four machine learning algorithms. This helped to ensure that the models were not overfitting to the training data and were instead accurately classifying the LULC classes based on the provided predictor variables.
