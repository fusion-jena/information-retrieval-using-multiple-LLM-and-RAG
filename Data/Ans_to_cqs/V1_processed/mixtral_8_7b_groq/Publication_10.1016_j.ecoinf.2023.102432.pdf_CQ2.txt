The provided context does not give information about the use of deep learning techniques. Instead, it focuses on the use of machine learning approaches, specifically Random Forest and Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), for remote sensing image classification.

In this context, the data formats used are remote sensing images, such as NAIP (National Agriculture Imagery Program), RapidEye, and Landsat. These images are likely provided in a raster format, where each pixel contains spectral data representing the reflected light in various bands.

The spectral data extracted from the imagery are then grouped and labeled based on the presence or absence of Brazilian peppertree at any abundance level. The labeled groups, referred to as "bags" in the context of MIL, are used for training and testing the machine learning models.

The context does not mention the use of other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV files in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is important to note that these formats could be used in other stages of a deep learning project, depending on the specific problem and data sources.
