Based on the provided context, there is no specific mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling in the deep learning model used in the study by Do and Tran (2023). However, the study mentions the use of a deep learning model combined with an optimization algorithm for detecting the dispersal of the early stages of spotted butterfish in northern Vietnam under global warming.

The study by Peterson and Evans (2019) is cited for the idea that increasing the dimensions used in the assessment through additional variables can be useful. This suggests that the deep learning model may incorporate other data augmentation techniques beyond those specifically mentioned.

In general, data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in deep learning models for image recognition tasks to increase the size of the training dataset and improve model performance. These techniques involve creating new training examples by applying transformations to the original images, such as flipping them horizontally or vertically, rotating them by a certain angle, or scaling them up or down.

However, without more specific information about the deep learning pipeline used in the study by Do and Tran (2023), it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query.
