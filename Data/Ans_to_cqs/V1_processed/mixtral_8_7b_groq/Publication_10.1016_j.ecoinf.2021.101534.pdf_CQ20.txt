The deep learning model for sound identification was trained using a workstation equipped with two NVIDIA Titan RTX GPUs.

The training process for the model used YOLOv5s, the smallest weight of YOLOv5, as the base architecture. The model was trained for 100 epochs with a batch size of 32 and an input image dimension of 640 Ã— 640. During the training process, data augmentation techniques such as scaling, color space adjustments, and Mosaic augmentation were applied. Specifically, four original spectrograms were randomly selected, resized, cropped, and color jittered before being merged into one big input image for model training.

The hardware resources used for this training process included two NVIDIA Titan RTX GPUs, which are high-performance graphics processing units commonly used for deep learning applications. The workstation also included an Intel Xeon E5-2660 V4 CPU, 16GB of DDR4 2400 ECC RAM, and two Western Digital black AN1500 4 TB NVMePCIe SSDs. However, the context suggests that the primary hardware resources used for training the deep learning model were the two NVIDIA Titan RTX GPUs.

It's worth noting that the use of GPUs for deep learning training can significantly reduce the required training time compared to using CPUs alone. GPUs are designed to handle parallel computations, making them well-suited for the matrix and vector operations commonly used in deep learning algorithms.

Therefore, the use of NVIDIA Titan RTX GPUs for training the deep learning model for sound identification likely contributed to the efficient use of training data and minimization of the dilution effect, as mentioned in the context.
