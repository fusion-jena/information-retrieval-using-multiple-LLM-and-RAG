Based on the provided context, there is no information indicating that any type of deep learning model, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or Transformers, is used in the pipeline. The text mainly discusses the use of predictive modeling and the application of random forests as a classifier for modeling. It also mentions the consideration of correlated predictors and the use of bootstrapping in the context of random forests. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer with certainty, but according to the context, deep learning models do not seem to be part of the pipeline.
