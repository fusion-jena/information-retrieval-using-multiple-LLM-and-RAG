Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The context mainly focuses on the development and accuracy assessment of a land cover classification model for vegetation types.

However, in the general process of training a machine learning model, determining when training is complete often involves monitoring the performance of the model on a validation dataset during the training process. Commonly, training is considered complete when the validation loss stops decreasing or reaches a plateau, indicating that the model has learned the underlying patterns in the training data and is not overfitting. Additionally, early stopping rules can be implemented to prevent overfitting and save training time.

In the context provided, the accuracy assessment of the land cover classification model involves comparing the LWHabmod and GMEPmod datasets, applying decision rules based on peat depth and Phase-1 habitat maps, and modifying the GMEPmod data labels accordingly. The accuracy of the model is then evaluated using an error matrix, producer's and user's accuracy, and overall accuracy.

Therefore, while the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete are not provided in the context, the general process of monitoring validation loss and applying early stopping rules likely applies.
