The optimization of hyperparameters in models is a crucial step in machine learning to ensure the best performance of the model. However, the specific pieces of context provided do not give detailed information on how the hyperparameters of the models are optimized in the mentioned studies.

Nevertheless, the Probst et al. (2019) study on hyperparameters and tuning strategies for random forests mentions that there are different methods for hyperparameter tuning, such as grid search, random search, and more sophisticated methods like Bayesian optimization. Among these, grid search and random search are the most commonly used methods.

Grid search exhaustively tries all possible combinations of the hyperparameters within a predefined range, which can be computationally expensive, especially for models with many hyperparameters. On the other hand, random search randomly selects combinations of hyperparameters within a predefined range, which is generally faster and can achieve similar or even better results than grid search.

In the context of remote sensing and GIS, studies like Raab et al. (2020), Ramoelo et al. (2015), Liu et al. (2017), Marino (2023a), and Marino (2023b) use various methods for image processing, feature extraction, and classification. While they might have optimized the hyperparameters of their models, the provided context does not offer specific details about the optimization methods used.

In summary, the optimization of hyperparameters in models can be achieved using methods like grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization. However, the specific pieces of context provided do not contain enough information to answer the query regarding the optimization methods used in those studies.
