Based on the provided context, there are no specific details mentioned about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training for the FIS-based model used to map a suitable area for beekeeping. However, it is mentioned that they used the fuzzy logic toolbox of Matlab 2023b to implement the FIS models, which provides large capabilities to choose several membership functions and to build any desired set of inference rules.

It is also mentioned that they validated the Apis-FIS model using a field survey and compared the output map informed with field data to be 8% more than the one based on expert data from the literature. This suggests that they might have used a confusion matrix to compare the performance of the two models. A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model on a set of test data for which the true values are known. It can show the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

Additionally, it is mentioned that they used the Nova Scotia Forest Ecosystem Classification at 10 m resolution for both models, which suggests that they might have used metrics calculation to compare the performance of the two models. Metrics calculation can include measures such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

In summary, while the context does not provide specific details about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, it can be inferred that they might have used a confusion matrix and metrics calculation to compare the performance of the output map informed with field data to the one based on expert data from the literature. However, there is no mention of Saliency maps.
