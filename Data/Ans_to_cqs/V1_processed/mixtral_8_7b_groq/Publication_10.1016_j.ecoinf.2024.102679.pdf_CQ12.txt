The type of deep learning model used in the image processing pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that artificial neural networks are employed in deep learning to achieve challenging tasks such as detecting animals in aerial imagery. A common type of neural network used for image processing tasks is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is particularly well-suited for image classification and object detection tasks. Therefore, it is possible that a CNN or a variant of it is used in this pipeline. Nonetheless, without explicit information, it is not possible to definitively state the type of deep learning model used.
