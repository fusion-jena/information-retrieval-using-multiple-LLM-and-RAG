Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the use of high spatial resolution satellite image data for ecological applications, specifically in the Chishui River Basin. The studies mentioned in the context use different data sources such as Landsat-8, GF-1, and Sentinel-2A, but there is no indication of where the data and the deep learning pipeline related to these studies are stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific repository for the data and pipeline. However, it is common for researchers to share their data and code through repositories like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF, so it is possible that the data and pipeline are available in one of these platforms. I would recommend contacting the authors of the studies for more information.
