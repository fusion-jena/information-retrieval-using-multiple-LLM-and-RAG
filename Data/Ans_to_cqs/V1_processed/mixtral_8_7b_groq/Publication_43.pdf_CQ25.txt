The purpose of the deep learning model, as described in the provided context, is classification. Specifically, it is used to classify image patches into one of two classes: Ziziphus lotus shrubs or bare soil with sparse vegetation.

The deep learning model in question is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is a type of neural network that is particularly well-suited to image classification tasks. The CNN is trained on 80x80 pixel image patches that have been extracted from larger images and labeled as either containing a Ziziphus lotus shrub or bare soil with sparse vegetation. The CNN is then able to classify new, unseen image patches based on the patterns it has learned during training.

The training of the CNN is based on minimizing the average loss between the predicted output of the network and the ground truth class labels. This is done using the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimization algorithm, which updates the weights of the network iteratively based on the gradient of the loss function.

It is also worth noting that in the case of GoogLeNet, the losses of the two auxiliary classifiers are weighted and added to the total loss of each training iteration. This is done to improve the performance of the network by providing additional supervision during training.

In summary, the deep learning model described in the provided context is a CNN that is trained for the purpose of classifying image patches into one of two classes: Ziziphus lotus shrubs or bare soil with sparse vegetation. The training of the CNN is based on minimizing the average loss between the predicted output of the network and the ground truth class labels using the SGD optimization algorithm.
