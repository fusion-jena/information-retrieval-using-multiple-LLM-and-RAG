The context provided does not give specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some resources and techniques used in the processing and analysis of the data.

In the study described, the authors use deep learning technologies, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and semantic segmentation, to extract plant cover information without training on actual annotated plant cover data. They use a ResNet50 as the base network, which is initialized with ImageNet weights from Keras. The network is used in conjunction with a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) to increase the network output resolution.

The study also mentions other papers and sources that may provide more information about the data collection methods. For example, Altalak et al. (2022) discuss smart agriculture applications using deep learning technologies, which may include information on data collection methods. Bambil et al. (2020) discuss plant species identification using color learning resources, shape, and texture through machine learning and artificial neural networks, which may also include information on data collection methods.

In addition, there are several papers that discuss remote sensing and image analysis techniques for ecological applications, such as Bauer and Strauss (2014) and Blaschke (2010). These papers may provide insight into the data collection methods used in the study, as remote sensing and image analysis techniques often involve the use of sensors and public datasets.

Overall, while the context does not provide specific details about the data collection methods used in the study, it suggests that sensors and public datasets may be used in the data collection process, and further references are provided for more information.
