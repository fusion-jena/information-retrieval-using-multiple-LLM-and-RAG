There is no information in the provided context that a deep learning model, such as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer, is used in the pipeline. The context focuses on the use of machine learning (ML) techniques, specifically Random Forest (RF) algorithm, for multi-layer classification to identify areas affected by wildfires. The RF algorithm is a type of ensemble learning method, not deep learning. The optimization of data structures and RF algorithm's performance using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV are also discussed, but there is no mention of any deep learning models.
