After training an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model, there are several postprocessing steps that can be involved, such as calculating metrics, generating saliency maps, and creating a confusion matrix. However, based on the provided context, only the calculation of metrics is explicitly mentioned.

In the context, an ANN model is used for predicting variables and improving overall prediction accuracy by combining multiple data sources. The ANN model used here is a Backpropagation ANN (BP-ANN) with an input layer, two hidden layers, and an output layer. The number of hidden layers and neurons is determined through a trial and error process. The 'neuralnet' package of R 4.1.2 software is used for developing the BP-ANN model.

After developing the ANN model, the accuracy of the model is evaluated by calculating metrics. The context mentions the use of a loss function for evaluating the model's performance. However, it does not specify any other metrics that are calculated.

Saliency maps and confusion matrices are not mentioned in the provided context. Saliency maps are a way of visualizing the importance of input features in the model's prediction. A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model. It compares the predicted labels to the actual labels and provides information about the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

In summary, based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after training the ANN model include calculating metrics, specifically a loss function. Saliency maps and confusion matrices are not mentioned.
