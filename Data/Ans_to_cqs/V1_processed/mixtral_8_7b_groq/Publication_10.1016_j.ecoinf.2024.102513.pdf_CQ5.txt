Based on the provided context, the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for land use and land cover (LULC) classification are not explicitly mentioned. However, it is stated that the deep learning model was trained using various datasets in the field of deep learning.

The focus of the studies is more on the application of deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for LULC classification using remote sensing Earth observation data. The CNN architecture consists of an input layer, convolutional layer, pooling layer, fully connected layer, and output layer.

In general, when applying deep learning models to image classification tasks, popular datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet are commonly used for training and testing the models. These datasets contain annotated images that can be used to train the model for image recognition tasks.

However, in the context of LULC classification, the datasets used would likely consist of satellite or aerial imagery with corresponding annotations for different land use and land cover classes. These datasets may include features such as spectral bands, textural information, and other relevant data for LULC classification.

Therefore, while the specific datasets used in the LULC classification deep learning pipeline are not provided, it can be inferred that the datasets consist of satellite or aerial imagery with corresponding annotations for different land use and land cover classes.
