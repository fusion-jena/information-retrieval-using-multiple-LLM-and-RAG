Based on the provided context, there is no information available about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository where it would be available, such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. The context focuses on the use of different estimators for calculating tree diversity indices in forestry and ecological informatics.

The paper by Pommerening and Sterba (2024) in the journal Ecological Informatics discusses various estimators for calculating tree diversity indices, including the inventory estimator (Eq. 7), NN1 estimator (Eq. 9), NN2 estimator (Eq. 8), NN3 estimator (Eq. 10), and NN4 estimator (Eq. 11). The paper compares the relative root mean square error (rRMSE) of these diversity indices over sample size. However, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a data repository associated with it.

Therefore, I cannot provide the location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline as it is not mentioned in the given context.
