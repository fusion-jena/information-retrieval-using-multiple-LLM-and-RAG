The provided context discusses the development of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model for predicting water quality, but it does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps taken before training the model. However, it can be inferred that some data preprocessing steps were applied.

Firstly, the data set was randomly split into two sets: a training set (80%) and a validation set (20%). This is a common preprocessing step in machine learning to assess the model's performance and prevent overfitting.

Secondly, the mean square error (MSE) between the model output and the measured data was calculated for each configuration of the number of nodes in the hidden layer and the learning rate. This implies that the data was prepared in a format that allowed for this calculation.

Lastly, the cross-correlation was calculated for time series data. This suggests that the time series data was preprocessed to calculate the cross-correlation.

However, the context does not explicitly mention other common preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Normalization and scaling are often applied to standardize the range of input features, which can improve the model's performance. Cleaning is also an important preprocessing step to handle missing values or outliers in the data.

Therefore, while the context provides some insight into the preprocessing steps taken, it does not provide a complete picture. It can be inferred that some preprocessing steps were taken, but the specific steps of normalization, scaling, and cleaning are not mentioned.
