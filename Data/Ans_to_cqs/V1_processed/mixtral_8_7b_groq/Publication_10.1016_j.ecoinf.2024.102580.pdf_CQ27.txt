Based on the provided context, the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model is not explicitly mentioned. However, we can infer that the model was trained using a semantic segmentation approach for vegetation mapping. The data used for training the model includes 2012 aerial imagery, and the model achieved high accuracy, precision, and recall rates for different substrate types.

After training the model, the researchers evaluated its performance using a test dataset. The deep learning and post-processing scripts, along with the data output, are available on GitHub, which suggests that the model could be deployed using these scripts. However, the context does not provide information on how to use these scripts to deploy the model.

Moreover, the platform for deploying the model is not specified in the given context. The researchers aimed to stimulate the uptake of deep learning for enhancing the data obtained from aerial imagery to improve the monitoring and conservation of natural ecosystems. Therefore, it is possible that they intended for the model to be deployed on various platforms depending on the user's needs.

In summary, while the context provides information on the training and evaluation of the deep learning model, it does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the model. The deep learning and post-processing scripts are available on GitHub, but the context does not provide information on how to use these scripts to deploy the model. The platform for deploying the model is also not specified in the given context.
