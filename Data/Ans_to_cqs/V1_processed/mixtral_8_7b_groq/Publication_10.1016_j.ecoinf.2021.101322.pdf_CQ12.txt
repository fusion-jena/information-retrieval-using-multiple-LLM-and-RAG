The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This information can be inferred from the context provided, specifically in section 2.3 where it is mentioned that the CNN was implemented using the Keras and TensorFlow software packages in Python. Additionally, a Keras implementation of EfficientNet-B4, which is a CNN-based architecture, was used for the model. The pre-trained weights used for transfer learning were also available through the EfficientNet API, further confirming the use of a CNN in the pipeline.
