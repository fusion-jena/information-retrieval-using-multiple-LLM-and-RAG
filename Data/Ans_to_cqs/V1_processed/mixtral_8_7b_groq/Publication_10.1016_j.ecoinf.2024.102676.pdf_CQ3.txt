The provided context does not give specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for this study. However, it does mention the development and enhancement of the Footprint Identification Technique (FIT) method for identifying and classifying animal species based on their footprints.

In general, data annotation techniques for deep learning models include:

1. Bounding box annotation: Drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest in images to define the object's location.
2. Instance segmentation: Labeling each pixel in an image to indicate the object it belongs to, providing a more precise object mask.
3. Semantic segmentation: Grouping pixels in an image into semantically meaningful regions, without distinguishing instances within the same class.
4. Point annotation: Labeling key points or landmarks on objects, useful for human pose estimation or facial keypoint detection.

For the FIT method, the data annotation process likely involves labeling footprints with the corresponding animal species. The context suggests the use of citizen science data collection, which may involve various annotation techniques by different contributors. However, specific details about the data annotation techniques are not provided.
