The data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study is not explicitly provided in the given text. However, it is mentioned that the pre-processed dataset and the Python code for implementing the framework are available on GitHub, and the DOI for the dataset on Zenodo is provided (<https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11479475>). It can be assumed that the data used in the deep learning pipeline is available in this repository. Therefore, the answer to the query is: <https://github.com/IFCA-Advanced-Computing/Thermocline_prediction> and <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11479475>.
