The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, as mentioned in the context. These metrics include overall accuracy (OA), kappa coefficient (KC), producer's accuracy (PA), user's accuracy (UA), commission error (CE), and omission error (OE). 

The overall accuracy (OA) is a ratio of the total number of correct predictions to the total number of input samples. It is defined as the sum of true positives (TP) and true negatives (TN) divided by the total number of samples. The KC, on the other hand, is a measure of the agreement between the predicted and actual values, taking into account the possibility of the agreement occurring by chance.

Producer's accuracy (PA) and user's accuracy (UA) are other important metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. PA is the ratio of the number of correctly predicted samples in a given class to the total number of actual samples in that class. UA, on the other hand, is the ratio of the number of correctly predicted samples in a given class to the total number of predicted samples in that class.

Commission error (CE) and omission error (OE) are also used to evaluate the performance of the model. CE is the ratio of the number of samples misclassified as a given class to the total number of actual samples in other classes. OE is the ratio of the number of samples misclassified as other classes to the total number of actual samples in a given class.

These metrics are reported in confusion matrix format, which provides a summary of prediction results on a classification problem. The confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the number of false positives, false negatives, true positives, and true negatives.

In addition to these metrics, the context also mentions the use of visual assessment for evaluating the classification process. This involves obtaining image subsets from corresponding GE images and the final citrus map for visual evaluation. The coordinates of the cropped subsets are also surveyed in the field operation.
