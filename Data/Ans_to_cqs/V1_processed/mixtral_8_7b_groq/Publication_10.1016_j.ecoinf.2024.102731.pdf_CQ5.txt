The query asks about the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, the provided context does not contain information about these specific datasets. Instead, it describes the datasets used in a study on rabbit habitat suitability.

The datasets used in the rabbit habitat study include climate data, a digital elevation model (DEM), a lithostratigraphic map, roads data, hunting areas data, landscape metrics, and a soil map. The climate data includes maximum temperature and precipitation, and it was obtained from Gutiérrez et al. (2019) in NetCDF format with a resolution of 0.1 degrees. The DEM data was obtained from the Copernicus program in ASCII format with a resolution of 25 m. The lithostratigraphic map was obtained from del Pozo Gómez (2009) in Shapefile format with a scale of 1:100,000. The roads data was obtained from the ICV (2022) in Shapefile format with a scale of 1:5000. The hunting areas data was also obtained from the ICV (2022) in Shapefile format with a scale of 1:5000. The landscape metrics data was obtained from ESA (2010) in RasterLayer format with a resolution of 300 m. Finally, the soil map was obtained from Duscher et al. (2015) in Shapefile format.

Therefore, while the provided context does not contain information about the deep learning datasets MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, it does describe the datasets used in a study on rabbit habitat suitability.
