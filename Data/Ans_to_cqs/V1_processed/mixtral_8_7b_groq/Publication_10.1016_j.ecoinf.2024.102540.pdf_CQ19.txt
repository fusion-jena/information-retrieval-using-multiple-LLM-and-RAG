The deep learning model in question is a part of the YOLOv5 family, which is built on the PyTorch machine learning framework. This information is provided in the first piece of context, which states that the YOLOv5 models are open-source computer vision models created by Ultralytics and are built on the PyTorch framework. The second piece of context further confirms this by mentioning that the models are created using the Python programming language. While the specific deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) is not explicitly mentioned in the second piece of context, the use of Python and the existence of a PyTorch-based implementation in the first piece of context strongly suggest that PyTorch is the framework used to build the YOLOv5 models.
