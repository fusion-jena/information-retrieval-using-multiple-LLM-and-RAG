The text provided does not give information on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. Hyperparameter optimization is an important step in machine learning model training, as it involves tuning various parameters to improve the model's performance. Common methods for hyperparameter optimization include grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization. However, the specific method used for the model in question is not mentioned in the text.

The text does provide information on the performance of the model in detecting environmental conditions, such as turbidity, biofilm, overexposure, bubbles, and clear or low-light conditions. It also gives details about the hardware and software used for training the model, including the operating system, CPU/microprocessor, memory, storage, and power consumption.

The model's performance is evaluated based on Geekbench 5 single-core and multi-core scores, as well as frame difference and scanline frame processing rates. The text also includes a table showing the performance of various hardware platforms, such as the Nvidia Jetson Nano, Raspberry Pi 4, and MediaTek Pumpkin i500, in comparison to the model's performance.

Overall, while the text provides valuable information about the model's performance and hardware specifications, it does not give details on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized.
