The provided context does not contain information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning models. The article focuses on evaluating six state-of-the-art deep learning architectures for deep-sea substratum characterization and proposing a classification decision committee (CDC) for fusing individual predictions. The models were evaluated on single and multi-label classification problems across three different sites. However, the context does not mention any details about the deployment platform.
