The deep learning model in the study is built using PyTorch. The authors implemented DEPP (Discrete Embedding Phylogenetic Placement) using PyTorch and trained the models on 2080Ti NVIDIA GPUs. PyTorch is a popular open-source machine learning library based on the Torch library, which is used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing. It provides maximum flexibility and speed, as well as being able to run on a wide variety of hardware, making it a suitable choice for building the deep learning model in this study.
