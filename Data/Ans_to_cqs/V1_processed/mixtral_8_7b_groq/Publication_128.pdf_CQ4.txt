Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling in the training process of AlexNet, MobileNet, or ResNet. However, it is important to note that data augmentation is a common technique used in deep learning to increase the amount and variability of training data, which can help improve model performance and reduce overfitting.

Data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling can be applied to the input data during training to create new variations of the original images. For example, flipping an image horizontally or vertically can create a new image that can help the model learn invariance to image orientation. Rotating an image by a certain angle can help the model learn to recognize objects in different poses. Scaling an image up or down can help the model learn to recognize objects at different sizes.

While the provided context does not mention these specific data augmentation techniques, it does mention other techniques used in the training process. For example, in the training of AlexNet, the input data is batch normalized before training, and a batch size of 30 is used. In the training of MobileNet, a width multiplier of 1.2 and a resolution multiplier of 1 are used. In the training of both AlexNet and MobileNet, an optimized rectified linear activation function, Leaky ReLU, is introduced into the models after the convolution or concatenate layer.

Furthermore, the context mentions that the resolution of input data is 224x224 with Red Green Blue (RGB) format for both AlexNet and MobileNet. This means that the input images are already preprocessed and resized before being fed into the network. Therefore, it is possible that data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling were applied during the preprocessing stage of the input data.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling, it is a common practice in deep learning to use such techniques to improve model performance and reduce overfitting. It is possible that these techniques were applied during the preprocessing stage of the input data in the training of AlexNet and MobileNet.
