Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. The text focuses on various methods and techniques for soil nutrient concentration analysis, including partial least-squares regression (PLSR) and other machine learning algorithms. However, it does not mention any details about the hardware resources used for deep learning model training, such as GPUs or TPUs. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query.
