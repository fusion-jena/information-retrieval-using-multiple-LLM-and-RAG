The Area Under Curve (AUC) and True Skill Statistics (TSS) are the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the ensemble models for predicting suitable areas of orchids. The AUC measures the model's ability to distinguish between suitable and unsuitable areas, and TSS is a threshold-dependent accuracy measure that takes into account both omission and commission errors. The models used in the study have AUC values greater than 0.90 and TSS values greater than 0.80, indicating good performance. These metrics are commonly used in machine learning for model evaluation, especially in binary classification problems. However, accuracy, precision, and recall are not explicitly mentioned as evaluation metrics in the provided context.
