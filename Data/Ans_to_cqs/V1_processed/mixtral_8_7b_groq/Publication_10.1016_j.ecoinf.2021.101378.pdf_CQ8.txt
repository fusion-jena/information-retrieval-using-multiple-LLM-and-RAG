Based on the provided context, there is no information about a deep learning pipeline or its code repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket) for predicting the potential occurrence of pine wilt disease. The context discusses the use of machine learning algorithms, including random forest and Maxent models, for predicting the disease's potential occurrence. However, it does not mention any deep learning methods or their code repositories.

The context does provide information on the use of machine learning algorithms in predicting the potential occurrence of pine wilt disease based on environmental factors in South Korea. The authors used R packages for their analysis, such as "randomForest" for the random forest model, "ENMeval" for model evaluation, and "raster" for raster data manipulation. However, there is no information about deep learning pipelines or code repositories.

Therefore, I cannot provide the code repository of the deep learning pipeline as it is not mentioned in the given context.
