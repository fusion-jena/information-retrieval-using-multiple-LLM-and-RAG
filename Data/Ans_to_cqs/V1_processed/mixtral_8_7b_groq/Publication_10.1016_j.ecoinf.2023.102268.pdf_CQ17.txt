The provided context does not give specific information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a cubic polynomial kernel is used as the classifier model, which implies that some measures were taken to prevent overfitting. SVMs are known for their robustness against overfitting due to their ability to handle high-dimensional data and their capacity to generalize well from training data to unseen data.

Moreover, the deep learning model used in this study is ResNet-50, a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network (CNN) developed and pre-trained using millions of label images in over 1000 categories. Although it was not explicitly trained on spectrograms, it is mentioned that many studies have shown that CNNs pre-trained for one task can extract meaningful features distant from the original training dataset. This suggests that transfer learning, a technique commonly used in deep learning to prevent overfitting, was applied.

In transfer learning, a pre-trained model is used as a starting point for a new, related task, and fine-tuning is performed on a smaller dataset. This approach leverages the knowledge gained from the original task and helps prevent overfitting by reducing the number of parameters that need to be learned from scratch.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization, it implies that transfer learning and SVM were used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
