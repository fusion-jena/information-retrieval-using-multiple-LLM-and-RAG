The provided context does not contain specific information about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. However, it does provide some context about the data and methods used in a remote sensing study related to Plateau lakes (PL).

The study used satellite images from the Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 missions, which have multiple spectral bands in the blue, green, red, and near-infrared regions. The sensors used are MSI and OLCI, and the spatial resolution varies from 10 to 300 meters. In addition to satellite data, in-situ measured data were also used to improve the quality of the retrievals.

The study used a deep learning model to retrieve remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) from the satellite data. The deep learning model was trained using a dataset of matched satellite and in-situ measurements. The training process involved adjusting the model's parameters to minimize the difference between the predicted and measured Rrs values.

The study notes that the accuracy of the atmospheric correction (AC) process used in the study is affected by the spatial and temporal factors of the PL. Therefore, the study suggests that further research is needed to improve the AC process for PL.

Based on this information, we can infer that the deep learning model was trained and then deployed to retrieve Rrs from satellite data. However, the specifics of the model serialization and platform selection are not provided in the context.
