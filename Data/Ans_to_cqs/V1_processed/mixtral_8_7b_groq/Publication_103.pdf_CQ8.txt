The provided context does not give information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text focuses on the results and implications of the study, as well as providing some details about the data sets and methods used. However, it does not mention where the code for the deep learning pipeline can be found. It is possible that the code was not made publicly available, or it could be located in a repository that is not explicitly mentioned in the text. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
