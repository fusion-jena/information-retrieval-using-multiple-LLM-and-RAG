Based on the provided context, there is no information about a deep learning model. The text discusses the use of Bayesian networks, not deep learning, in the context of natural resource management and permafrost thaw depth. Therefore, I cannot provide information on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model in this case. The concepts mentioned in the query, such as a diverse dataset, cross-validation, and stratified splitting, are indeed common techniques used to improve the generalizability of machine learning models, including deep learning models. However, without specific information related to a deep learning model in this context, I cannot provide a detailed answer.
