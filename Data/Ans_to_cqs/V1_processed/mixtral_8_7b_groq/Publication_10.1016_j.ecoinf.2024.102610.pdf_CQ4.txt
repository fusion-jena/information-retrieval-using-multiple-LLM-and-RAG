Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. Data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in deep learning to increase the size of the training dataset and improve model performance by creating new variations of the existing data. However, the specific techniques used in this case are not mentioned.

The context does provide information on the data sources and methods used in the study, including tsetse density data, TerraClimate, CHIRPS, MODIS, and WorldPop. It also mentions the use of machine learning and deep learning approaches for predicting infectious diseases. However, the details of the data preprocessing and augmentation techniques are not provided.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context. It is possible that the study used some data augmentation techniques, but this information is not available in the provided context.
