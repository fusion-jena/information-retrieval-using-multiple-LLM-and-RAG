The provided pieces of context do not directly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, they do discuss various applications of deep learning models in different fields such as hydrology, wind forecasting, and signal classification. In these applications, data preprocessing techniques like feature extraction and selection are mentioned, but there is no explicit reference to data annotation techniques.

In general, data annotation techniques are used to label or markup data, so that deep learning models can learn to recognize and classify different types of objects or patterns in images, videos, or other types of data. Some common data annotation techniques include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing a bounding box around an object of interest in an image or video frame. The bounding box coordinates are then used as input features for training object detection models.
2. Instance segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image according to the object it belongs to. Instance segmentation models can learn to recognize and segment multiple objects in a single image, even if they overlap or are occluded.
3. Semantic segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image according to the semantic class it belongs to, such as "sky", "road", or "building". Semantic segmentation models can learn to recognize and segment different types of objects or scenes in an image.
4. Text annotation: This technique involves labeling text data with relevant tags or categories, such as topic, sentiment, or entity recognition. Text annotation models can learn to classify and extract meaningful information from large volumes of text data.

In summary, while the provided pieces of context do not specifically mention data annotation techniques, they are an important part of the deep learning pipeline for training object detection, segmentation, and other types of models.
