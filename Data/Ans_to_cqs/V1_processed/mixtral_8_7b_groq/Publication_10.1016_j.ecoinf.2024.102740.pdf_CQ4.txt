Based on the provided context, there is no information about the use of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling in a deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the use of machine learning techniques, specifically random forests (RF), for classifying and estimating grassland characteristics. The RF model is trained using ground data points and validated using out-of-bag samples. The model is then applied to Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data to estimate forage quantity and quality in semi-natural grasslands. The RF model parameters are tuned to achieve the most accurate results. However, there is no mention of data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline.
