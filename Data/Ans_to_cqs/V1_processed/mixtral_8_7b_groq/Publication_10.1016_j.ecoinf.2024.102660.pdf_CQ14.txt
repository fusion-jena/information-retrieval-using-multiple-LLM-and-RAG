Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the Res\_AUNet model were optimized. The text does not mention any specific techniques such as grid search, random search, or any other optimization methods.

However, it does provide some details about the hyperparameters used during the training of the Res\_AUNet model. The initial learning rate was set to 0.001, and it was adjusted using the equal-interval adjustment strategy (StepLR), halving the original rate every 10 epochs of iteration. The training persisted for 120 epochs, with a batch size set to 8.

Additionally, the input images underwent random rotations, flips, and other image augmentation operations to enhance the network's robustness. These techniques can be seen as a way to indirectly optimize the model's performance by providing more diverse data and reducing overfitting.

In conclusion, while the text does not explicitly mention the use of hyperparameter optimization techniques like grid search or random search, it does provide some details about the hyperparameters used during the training of the Res\_AUNet model.
