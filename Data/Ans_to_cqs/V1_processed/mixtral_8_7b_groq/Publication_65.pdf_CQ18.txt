The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it mentions that Figure 11 shows the convergence of the evaluated networks, which suggests that the performance of the models was monitored during the training process. The x-axis in Figure 11 represents the number of epochs, and the y-axis represents the validation loss. This figure helps to understand how well the models are learning and generalizing to unseen data during the training process.

Moreover, the context provides information about the training time and inference time for each method. This information can also be used to monitor the model performance during training. If a model takes too long to train or shows poor inference time, it might indicate issues with the model's complexity or convergence.

In addition, the DDCN method has a unique strategy for processing testing images. It determines the best image resolution during the training phase for each evaluated input size and then processes the testing images using batches composed of the images with the best-evaluated size. This strategy can be seen as a way to optimize the model's performance during inference.

Overall, while the context does not provide explicit details about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training, it does offer information about convergence and processing times that can be used to infer the model's performance.
