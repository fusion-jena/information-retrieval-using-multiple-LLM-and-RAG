The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline described in the context is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the use of operations such as spectral normalization and LeakyReLU, which are commonly used in CNNs. Additionally, the output sizes listed in the context are typical of CNNs, with dimensions representing the height, width, and number of channels of the feature maps at each layer.

Furthermore, the introduction of the dynamic convolutional kernel decomposition (DCD) model in the study by Li et al. (2021) builds upon the CNN architecture. The DCD model redefines the static convolution kernel by adding a dynamic component, which is dynamically adjusted based on the input. This is achieved by using a set of K parallel convolution kernels, which are aggregated by attention to generate an adaptive dynamic convolution.

The comparison of classification results of adding the DCD model on different models, including MobileNetV2, ResNet18, and VGG16, further supports the use of CNNs in the pipeline. These models are all well-known CNN architectures that have been widely used in various computer vision tasks.

Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model used in the pipeline described in the context is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
