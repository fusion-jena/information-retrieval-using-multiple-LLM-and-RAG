In the context provided, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in the project involving TensorFlow and the classification of Triatominae species relevant to Chagas disease are not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred that they used a combination of training and validation sets, with adjustments made to the default validation percentage due to the limited number of images available for some species.

The team used TensorFlow, an open-source deep learning platform, and adapted it for their project via Python. They adjusted two parameters from their default values: validation percentage and number of training steps. The default setting for validation percentage was 10%, but they increased this number to 16% given the small numbers of images available for some species. This action suggests that they modified the initial data split to allocate a larger portion to the validation set, presumably at the expense of the training set.

However, the text does not mention a separate test set for evaluating the model's performance. Instead, they employed a leave-one-out cross-validation approach for evaluation. In this approach, they left out a specific number of images or one image from among the species in a country to evaluate the model in each round. While this method can help assess the model's performance, it does not serve the same purpose as a separate test set, which is to provide an unbiased evaluation of the final model after training and validation.

In summary, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in the provided context involve adjusting the validation percentage from the default value of 10% to 16% and utilizing a leave-one-out cross-validation approach for evaluation. However, there is no explicit information about a separate test set for final model evaluation.
