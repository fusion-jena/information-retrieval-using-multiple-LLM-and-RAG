The provided context does not explicitly mention which deep learning framework was used to build the CNN models. The supplementary materials include Mathematica notebooks (Suppl. materials 1, 3, 2, 4), but Mathematica is not typically used as a deep learning framework. It is primarily a computational software that can be used for deep learning, but it is not as popular as other frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, it is possible that the Mathematica notebooks use built-in functions for deep learning or interfaces with other deep learning frameworks. Without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
