The specific dataset used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context is ImageNet. The VGG16 (OxfordNet) CNN architecture was chosen primarily due to its performance on the ImageNet dataset. ImageNet is a large-scale hierarchical image database that was developed by Deng, Dong, Socher, Li, Li, and Fei-Fei in 2009. It contains over 14 million images, distributed across 1000 object categories, and has been widely used in various computer vision tasks, including image classification and object detection.

In the context provided, ImageNet was used as a dataset for evaluating the performance of the CNN models in a classification pipeline. Specifically, the validation performance of CNN Model 4 was evaluated with respect to each of the six environmental conditions, and the results were presented in a confusion matrix (Figure 7(b)).

It is worth noting that ImageNet is not the only dataset used in the deep learning pipeline. Other popular datasets include MNIST, which is a dataset of handwritten digits, and CIFAR, which is a dataset of natural images. However, in the context provided, only ImageNet was mentioned as the dataset used in the deep learning pipeline.
