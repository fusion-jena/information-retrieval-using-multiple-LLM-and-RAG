The purpose of the deep learning model is object detection, specifically for tracking and identifying target objects in a scene with high dynamic density and low training data. This is achieved using the YOLOv7 model, which integrates Extended Efficient Layer Aggregation Network (E-ELAN), cascade-based modeling, model scaling, and model reparameterization. The model has a three-module structure: the input module, the backbone module, and the header network. The input module adjusts the image-related data to fit the backbone network size, while the backbone module extracts deep features from the input. The header network then uses these deep features to detect objects in the scene. However, the provided context does not mention the specific application or type of objects being detected.
