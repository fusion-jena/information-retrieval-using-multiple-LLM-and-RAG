Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, the context does mention the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for detecting humpback whale songs in a passive acoustic dataset.

In the context of object detection in images, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing a rectangle around the object of interest in an image. The coordinates of the rectangle are then used as labels for the object during training.
2. Instance segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image to indicate whether it belongs to the object of interest or not. This results in a segmented mask for each object instance in the image.

Given that the study in question is focused on detecting humpback whale songs in a passive acoustic dataset, it is possible that the data annotation technique used involves labeling time-series audio data with the presence or absence of whale songs. However, the provided context does not contain enough information to make a definitive conclusion about the specific data annotation technique used.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of both custom CNN architectures and transfer learning for building the detection model. Transfer learning involves using a pre-trained model as a starting point for training a new model on a different dataset. This can help reduce the amount of labeled data required for training and improve the performance of the model.

In summary, while the provided context does not contain explicit information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it is possible that bounding box annotation or instance segmentation were used for object detection in images. In the context of audio data, it is possible that time-series data was labeled with the presence or absence of whale songs. However, further information would be needed to make a definitive conclusion.
