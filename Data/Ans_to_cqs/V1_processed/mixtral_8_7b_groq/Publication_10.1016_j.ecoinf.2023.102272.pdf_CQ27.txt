The text provided does not give a detailed description of the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does provide some context about the training and selection process that can be used to infer some steps that might have been taken in the deployment process.


The text describes a model selection procedure where 20 candidate models were generated and trained using a small subset of the training data for 4 epochs. The accuracy of these models was then compared using a validation data set, and the model with the highest performance was selected for training on the full training data for up to 30 epochs.

After the training process, the selected model was likely serialized, which is the process of converting the model into a format that can be stored and loaded again. This format can vary depending on the deep learning framework used, but it typically involves saving the model architecture, weights, and other relevant information to a file.

Once the model is serialized, it can be deployed to a platform for use in production. The text does not provide information on which platform was used for deployment, but it is mentioned that the data used for training and validation were partitioned using the R package dismo. Therefore, it is possible that the model was deployed on an R-based platform.

In summary, the text provides some context about the training and selection process, but it does not give a detailed description of the deployment process. However, it can be inferred that the trained deep learning model was likely serialized and deployed to a platform for use in production.
