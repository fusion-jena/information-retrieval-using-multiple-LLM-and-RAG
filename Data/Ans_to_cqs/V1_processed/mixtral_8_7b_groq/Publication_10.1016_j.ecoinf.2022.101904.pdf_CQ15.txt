The provided context does not give specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The paper "3DUNetGSFormer: A deep learning pipeline for complex wetland mapping using generative adversarial networks and Swin transformer" by Jamali et al. (2022) focuses on the architecture and performance of the proposed pipeline, but it does not mention the optimization techniques used during the training of the models.

The optimization technique is an essential component of the training process in deep learning as it helps to minimize the loss function and find the optimal set of weights for the model. Common optimization techniques include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad.

Without further information, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to the query. However, it is a standard practice to use optimization techniques like Adam or SGD in deep learning models. Therefore, it is likely that one of these techniques was used in the deep learning pipeline proposed in the paper.
