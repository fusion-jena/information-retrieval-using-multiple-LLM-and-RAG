Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of measures such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it is stated that the targeted fish species dataset was used for training and validation, but the diversity or size of this dataset is not described.

There is a mention of dividing the dataset into training and validation sets in an 8:2 ratio using a random selection process, which is a simple form of splitting the data. However, this method does not account for potential imbalances in the data, which could affect the model's ability to generalize.

The context mainly focuses on reducing the number of parameters and memory access to enhance the model's performance and speed. While these techniques can improve the efficiency of the model, they do not directly contribute to the generalizability of the model.

To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the following measures could have been taken:

1. Diverse dataset: Collecting a diverse dataset with a wide range of fish species, angles, lighting conditions, and environments would help the model to generalize better.

2. Cross-validation: Using cross-validation techniques such as k-fold cross-validation would help to evaluate the model's performance on different subsets of the data, providing a more robust estimate of its generalizability.

3. Stratified splitting: Using stratified splitting techniques would ensure that the training and validation sets have a similar distribution of fish species, reducing the risk of bias and improving the model's ability to generalize.

4. Data augmentation: Techniques such as rotation, scaling, and flipping could be used to artificially increase the size of the dataset and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

5. Regularization: Techniques such as L1 and L2 regularization could be used to prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, there are several techniques that could have been employed to improve its ability to generalize to new data.
