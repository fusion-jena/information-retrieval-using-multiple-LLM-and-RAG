Based on the information provided, there is no mention of any deep learning models, learning rates, or optimizers. The context focuses on the use of the Curve Number (CN) parameter from the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) to quantify the infiltration capacity in different sub-basins of the Umia River Basin. Four hypothetical scenarios were created to assess the impact of changing land use from agriculture to forestry. The scenario with the greatest improvement was S-Total, which involved changing 36% of the land from type B (moderate infiltration, 32-56 mm/h) to type C (slow infiltration, 13-32 mm/h), 10% to type D (very slow infiltration, <13 mm/h), and only 14% to type A (fast infiltration >76 mm/h). However, no details about deep learning model hyperparameters are provided in the context.


The context does not provide information on the hyperparameters used in deep learning models such as learning rate or optimizer.
