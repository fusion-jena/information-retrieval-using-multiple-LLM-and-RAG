Deep learning models often employ various strategies to handle randomness in the training process, ensuring the generation of reliable and reproducible results. One such strategy is the use of a random seed value.

A random seed value is an initial number used in algorithms to generate a sequence of random numbers. By setting a specific seed value, the sequence of random numbers becomes deterministic and reproducible. This feature is crucial for deep learning pipelines, as it ensures consistent results when running the same model multiple times.

In the context of deep learning, random seed values can be used in different stages of the pipeline, such as:

1. Initializing model weights: Deep learning models typically initialize their weights randomly. By setting a fixed seed value, the same set of initial weights will be used in each training run, allowing for consistent results.
2. Data shuffling and splitting: When preparing data for training, validation, and testing, it is common practice to shuffle and split the data into these subsets. A random seed value ensures consistent data shuffling and splitting across different runs.
3. Dropout regularization: Dropout is a regularization technique used in deep learning to prevent overfitting. It randomly drops out a proportion of neurons during training. By setting a fixed seed value, the same neurons will be dropped out in each training run, ensuring consistent results.

For instance, in the article "Filter-based ensemble feature selection and deep learning model for intrusion detection in cloud computing" (Eng. 82, 35â€“45), the authors use a deep learning model for intrusion detection. Although the paper does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value, it is a common practice in deep learning to handle randomness in the training process.

Similarly, in the paper "ARIMA forecasting of ambient air pollutants (O3, NO, NO2 and CO)" (Kumar, U., Jain, V., 2010), the authors use the ARIMA model for time-series forecasting. While this paper does not discuss deep learning, the concept of a fixed seed value for handling randomness is still applicable to other machine learning models, including deep learning models.

In summary, deep learning pipelines employ strategies like using a random seed value to handle randomness, ensuring consistent and reproducible results. This practice is beneficial for comparing different models, tuning hyperparameters, and ensuring the stability of the learning process.
