I'm sorry for any confusion, but the provided context does not contain information about regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context focuses on song variant tracking, data analysis, and sound source localization.

To answer your query, I'll provide a brief explanation of the mentioned regularization techniques:

1. Dropout: Dropout is a regularization technique used in deep learning models, particularly neural networks. During training, dropout randomly sets a fraction of the input neurons to zero, preventing the model from relying too much on specific neurons. This helps to reduce overfitting and improves the model's generalization ability.

2. L2 Regularization: L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is another technique used to prevent overfitting. It adds a penalty term to the loss function, which is proportional to the sum of the squares of all the model's weights. By increasing the loss for larger weights, L2 regularization encourages the model to distribute the importance of features more evenly, reducing overfitting.


The provided context does not contain information on the regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines. However, dropout and L2 regularization are two common regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting in deep learning models. Dropout randomly sets a fraction of input neurons to zero during training, while L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, discouraging large weights and promoting even feature importance distribution.
