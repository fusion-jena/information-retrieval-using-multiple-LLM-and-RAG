The optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline, as described in the provided context, is the Adam optimizer. The Adam optimizer is a type of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization method used for training deep learning models. It is an extension of the classical SGD algorithm that includes adaptive learning rate capabilities.

In this specific case, the Adam optimizer is used with a learning rate of 0.0005 for training a geographic prior model. The number of training epochs is set to 10, and the batch size is 32. These settings are determined based on preliminary experimentation.

The Adam optimizer combines the advantages of two other popular optimization methods, AdaGrad and RMSProp. It calculates individual adaptive learning rates for different parameters in the model by considering the first and second moments of the gradients. This leads to faster convergence and better performance compared to traditional SGD in many cases.

The focus of the study mentioned in the context is on keeping the models simple and computationally efficient, ensuring their reusability and applicability to other research cases. By using the Adam optimizer, the authors aim to improve the performance of a simple CNN while keeping the number of network parameters low.

In summary, the Adam optimizer, a type of adaptive stochastic gradient descent method, is used in the deep learning pipeline described in the provided context. This optimizer is chosen to improve the performance of a simple CNN while keeping the number of network parameters low.
