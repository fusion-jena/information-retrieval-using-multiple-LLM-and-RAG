Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model. However, I can describe a general process that is often used to deploy deep learning models in remote sensing applications, using the context as a guide.

First, a deep learning model is trained using aerial or satellite imagery data. For example, in the study by Liu and Abd-Elrahman (2018), a deep convolutional neural network was trained for wetlands classification using unmanned aerial systems (UAS) imagery. Similarly, Martins et al. (2021) trained a machine learning model for tree canopies segmentation in urban areas using LiDAR data.

Once the model is trained, it needs to be serialized, which means converting the model into a format that can be easily deployed on a platform. Model serialization can be done using various libraries and frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or scikit-learn.

After serialization, the model can be deployed on a platform for real-time or batch processing of new imagery data. The platform selection depends on the application requirements and the available resources. For example, if real-time processing is required, a cloud-based platform such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) can be used. On the other hand, if batch processing is sufficient, a local server or a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster can be used.

In the context of the provided studies, there is no specific information about the platform used for deployment. However, in the study by Marasigan et al. (2019), the authors used a marker-controlled watershed algorithm to measure mangrove crown diameter from airborne LiDAR data. This algorithm can be implemented on a local server or a HPC cluster for batch processing of LiDAR data.

In summary, the general process for deploying a trained deep learning model in remote sensing applications involves training the model, serializing it, and deploying it on a platform for real-time or batch processing of new imagery data. The platform selection depends on the application requirements and the available resources. However, the specific details of the deployment process are not provided in the given context.
