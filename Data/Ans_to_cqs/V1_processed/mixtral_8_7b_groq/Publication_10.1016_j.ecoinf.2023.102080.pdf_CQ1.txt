The provided context does not directly address the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the covsel package in R, which is used for automated, data-driven, parsimonious, and fast covariate selection for species distribution modeling. The raw data for this package would likely come from species occurrence surveys and environmental layers for modeling them.

In the context of species distribution modeling, raw data is typically collected through various surveys and sensors, as well as from public datasets. Surveys can include field observations, remote sensing, and citizen science initiatives, which all contribute to the collection of species occurrence data. Environmental layers, such as climate, topography, and land cover data, are also crucial for modeling species distributions and are often obtained from remote sensing or public datasets.

For example, Amano et al. (2016), Dickinson et al. (2010), and Pocock et al. (2017) discuss the increasing amount of species occurrence data from citizen science initiatives. These initiatives rely on public participation to collect species occurrence data, which can then be used as raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Kuenzer et al. (2014), Soille et al. (2018), and Sudmanns et al. (2020) discuss the availability of environmental layers for modeling species distributions, which are also an important component of the raw data used in the deep learning pipeline.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly answer the query, it can be inferred that raw data for species distribution modeling in the deep learning pipeline is collected through various surveys and sensors, as well as from public datasets. These surveys and sensors can include field observations, remote sensing, and citizen science initiatives, while environmental layers such as climate, topography, and land cover data are also crucial for modeling species distributions.
