The provided context discusses the evaluation of various machine learning models, including deep learning models, using several statistical measures. However, it does not explicitly mention the use of accuracy, precision, or recall to evaluate the deep learning model.

The metrics used to evaluate the deep learning model in the given study include Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R-squared (R2), Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), Model Efficiency (MEF), and Z-statistics. These metrics are used to assess the prediction performance, goodness of fit, performance relative to benchmarks, and statistical significance of the models.

RMSE and MAE are used to shed light on the prediction accuracy of the models. R2 measures the goodness of fit, while NSE and MEF assess the performance of the models relative to benchmarks. Z-statistics determine the statistical significance of the models.

Moreover, Taylor diagrams are used to provide a holistic visualization of multiple metrics, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of the models' performance. These metrics offer distinct perspectives, allowing a tailored evaluation based on specific modeling objectives and dataset characteristics.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention the use of accuracy, precision, or recall to evaluate the deep learning model, it provides a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance using other statistical measures.
