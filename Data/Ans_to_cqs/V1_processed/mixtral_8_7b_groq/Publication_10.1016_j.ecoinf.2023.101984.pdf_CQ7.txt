Based on the provided context, there is no information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context mainly discusses the analysis of the MaxEnt model's output for the classification of different vegetation layers and bio-climatic variables. Hence, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
