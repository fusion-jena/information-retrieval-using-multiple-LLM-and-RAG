The methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for bioacoustic classification can include surveys, sensors, and public datasets. 

Surveys are a common method for collecting bioacoustic data. For example, Simonis (2020) describes a passive acoustic survey of deep-diving odontocetes in the California Current Ecosystem. Surveys can be conducted in various marine environments, such as shallow coastal waters or deep offshore areas, and can target different taxa, including marine mammals, fish, and invertebrates. 

Sensors are another method for collecting bioacoustic data. These can include hydrophones, which are underwater microphones used to record sound in the ocean. Hydrophones can be deployed in various ways, such as moorings, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), or gliders. For instance, Soldevilla et al. (2008) used spectral properties of echolocation clicks recorded by hydrophones to classify Risso's and Pacific white-sided dolphins. 

Public datasets are also a valuable source of bioacoustic data for deep learning. For example, the NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service provides several datasets related to marine mammals, such as the Ocean Noise Reference Station data (ONRS) and the Passive Acoustic Survey (PAS) data. These datasets can be accessed and downloaded from the NOAA website (<https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap>). 

Moreover, data augmentation techniques can be used to enhance the raw data collected. Shorten and Khoshgoftaar (2019) provide a survey on image data augmentation for deep learning, which can be applied to bioacoustic data as well. Techniques such as flipping, rotation, and time-stretching can increase the sample size and diversity of the dataset, improving the performance of deep learning models. 

In summary, surveys, sensors, and public datasets are methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for bioacoustic classification. Additionally, data augmentation techniques can be used to enhance the dataset and improve the performance of deep learning models.
