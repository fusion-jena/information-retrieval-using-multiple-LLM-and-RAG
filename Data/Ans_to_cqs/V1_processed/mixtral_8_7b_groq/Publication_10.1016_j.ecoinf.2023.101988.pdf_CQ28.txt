The provided context does not contain information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model.

The context includes a study by Chalmers et al. (2021) that used a deep learning model to model animal biodiversity using acoustic monitoring. However, it does not mention the platform used for deployment. Similarly, the study by Wilson et al. (2022) used a deep learning model to analyze bird song output in the presence of drones, but the platform used for deployment is not specified.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model.
