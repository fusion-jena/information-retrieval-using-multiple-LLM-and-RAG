Based on the provided context, there is no specific strategy mentioned for monitoring the model performance during training. However, it is suggested that the performance of different models was evaluated and compared using benchmarking species results. These results indicate the Average Precision (AP) scores of various models for different bird species, suggesting the effectiveness of each model in detecting and recognizing specific bird species.

Moreover, it is mentioned that the impact of noise in the dataset and environmental clutter on the algorithm's performance was evaluated. The noise in the dataset can arise due to several reasons, such as vandalism, animal damage, loss of power, or extreme weather, making it difficult for the algorithm to learn the features of a particular bird species accurately.

Furthermore, it is recommended that choosing appropriate training times for different models is beneficial to save computing resources. Specifically, it is observed that the Cascade RCNN model had almost no increase in the mean Average Precision (mAP) at 9 epochs, and the Faster CNN model also showed a similar trend. However, the ATSS and RepPoint growth curves continued to 12 epochs, suggesting that they require more training data or a longer training schedule to perform better.

Therefore, while there is no explicit strategy mentioned for monitoring the model performance during training, the context suggests that the performance of different models was evaluated and compared based on their AP scores for various bird species, and their ability to handle noisy datasets and environmental clutter. Additionally, the impact of training times on the models' performance was also assessed.
