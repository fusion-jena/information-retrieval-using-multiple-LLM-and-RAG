Based on the information provided, there is no direct link to a data repository for the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the study. The study by Zhu, M., He, Y., He, Q., 2019, used a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model to classify land cover/land use (LCLU) for the Talassemtane National Park (TNP) using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. However, the study does not mention where the data or the code for the deep learning pipeline is stored or shared.

It is important to note that sharing data and code has become a standard practice in scientific research, and it is encouraged to make the data and code publicly available for reproducibility and transparency. Therefore, it is possible that the authors have shared the data and code in a repository, but it is not mentioned in the study.

In addition, the study by Boutahir, M.K., Farhaoui, Y., Azrour, M., 2022, reviewed machine learning and deep learning applications for solar radiation predictions in Morocco. However, the study does not mention any data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the studies reviewed.

Overall, based on the provided context, there is no direct link to a data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the studies mentioned. It is recommended to contact the authors of the studies for more information on the data and code used in their research.
