Based on the provided context, there is no information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The context focuses on the research framework, kNDVI classification, and trend analysis for vegetation health in the Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River (MRB), as well as the methods used for data processing and analysis.

The document discusses various aspects of the research, including the use of the Optimal Parameter-based Geographical Detector (OPGD) and Linear Regression Trend Analysis. However, it does not mention any details about the training process or the criteria for determining training completion.

In the context of machine learning and deep learning models, training completion is often determined by monitoring the performance on a validation set and stopping the training process when the validation loss plateaus or starts to increase, indicating that the model has learned the underlying patterns in the training data and is unlikely to improve further. However, without specific information from the given context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this query.
