The provided context does not contain information about the specific regularization methods used in a deep learning pipeline to prevent overfitting. The text focuses on the application of machine learning techniques, particularly in the context of land use and land cover classification, but it does not delve into the specifics of the deep learning pipeline or regularization techniques.

However, it is worth noting that regularization methods such as dropout and L2 regularization are commonly used in deep learning to prevent overfitting. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to make the model more robust and less prone to overfitting. L2 regularization, on the other hand, adds a penalty term to the loss function that encourages smaller weights, which can also help to reduce overfitting.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, it is common practice to use techniques such as dropout and L2 regularization for this purpose.
