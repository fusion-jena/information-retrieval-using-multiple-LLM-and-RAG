The provided context does not give specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The text mentions the use of deep learning models for semantic segmentation and object detection in the context of vegetation mapping and analyzing spatial patterns and resilience of ecosystems. It also mentions the challenge of access to computational resources for training deep neural networks. However, it does not specify the optimization techniques used for training these models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional information.
