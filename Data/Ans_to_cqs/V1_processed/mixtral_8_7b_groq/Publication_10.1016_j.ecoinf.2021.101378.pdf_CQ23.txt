Based on the provided context, the text does not mention the use of a deep learning model for any of the studies or ecological analyses. The models mentioned are artificial neural networks (which are not the same as deep learning models), random forest (RF), and maximum entropy modeling (Maxent). Therefore, I cannot provide information on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model in this context.

However, for the RF and Maxent models, the text does mention that these models were used for species distribution studies, specifically for predicting the occurrence of Pine Wilt Disease (PWD). Although the text does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of these models, it does provide information on the dataset and validation methods used.

The dataset used for the RF and Maxent models includes various environmental and climatic variables. For example, Hirata et al. (2017) used temperature, precipitation, and soil data for predicting the potential distribution of PWD under future climate change scenarios. Iordache et al. (2020) used airborne spectral imagery for detecting PWD using a machine learning approach.

For validation, the text mentions that the RF and Maxent models were compared to evaluate their effectiveness. Specifically, Mi et al. (2017) reported that the RF model showed better performance than the Maxent model for predicting species distribution. Additionally, the text mentions that an ensemble model was developed by integrating the RF and Maxent models to generate better results.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention any measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, it does provide information on the dataset and validation methods used for the RF and Maxent models. These models were used for species distribution studies, specifically for predicting the occurrence of PWD, and were compared and integrated to generate better results.
