The provided context does not directly discuss optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. However, it does contain information about related concepts in data analysis and ecological risk assessment.

Deep learning models often use optimization algorithms to minimize the difference between predicted and actual values, known as the loss function. Common optimization techniques include SGD, Adam, RMSprop, and others. These methods update the model's parameters iteratively to find the optimal solution.

In the context, there are references to Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a dimensionality reduction technique (Lever et al., 2017). PCA is not an optimization technique for deep learning pipelines, but it is used to reduce the dimensionality of large datasets by projecting them onto a lower-dimensional space while preserving most of the variance.

Another concept mentioned is the use of zonation for prioritization in ecological risk assessment (Moilanen, 2007; Margules & Pressey, 2000). Zonation is a systematic reserve selection method that ranks areas based on their conservation value. While not an optimization technique for deep learning, zonation shares the goal of finding optimal solutions within a specific context.

In summary, the provided context does not contain information about optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines, such as SGD or Adam. However, it does discuss related concepts, such as dimensionality reduction and systematic reserve selection methods, which share the goal of finding optimal solutions in data analysis and ecological risk assessment.
