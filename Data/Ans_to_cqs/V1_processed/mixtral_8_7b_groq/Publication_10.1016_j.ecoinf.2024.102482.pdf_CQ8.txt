Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context includes several research papers that discuss the application of deep learning techniques in various fields of ecology, including water quality monitoring using Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) behavior. However, none of the papers mention or provide a link to the code repository for their deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query. It is possible that the authors have not made the code publicly available, or it may be hosted on a different platform not mentioned in the context. If you are interested in a specific study mentioned in the context, I would recommend reaching out to the authors to inquire about the availability of the code.
