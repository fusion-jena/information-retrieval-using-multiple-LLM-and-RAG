Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, the text does mention the use of FWI and FFMC data layers with a spatial resolution of 1 Ã— 1 km, and the application of the nine-cell approach for smoothing data inaccuracies within single grid cells.

The FWI (Fire Weather Index) and FFMC (Fine Fuel Moisture Code) are part of the Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System (CFFDRS), which is used to estimate the likelihood of forest fires. These data layers likely contain numerical values related to fire danger, rather than image or video data that would typically be used for bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.

The nine-cell approach involves dividing each grid cell into nine sub-cells and calculating the mean value for each sub-cell. This technique could be used to preprocess the data before feeding it into a deep learning model, but it does not necessarily involve any specific data annotation technique.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to the query about data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
