The context provided does not give information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The text mentions that the data was collected from goat farms and that it includes approximately 10 million sound events lasting over 34,000 hours. The data was divided into 70% for training, 10% for validation, and 20% for testing purposes. However, it does not specify where this data can be accessed. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
