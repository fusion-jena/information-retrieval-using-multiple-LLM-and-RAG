Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the TIPNet-based process network model were optimized. The text does not mention any methods such as grid search, random search, or other optimization techniques.

However, it is mentioned that the network computation considered lagged information from 1 to 12 hours (Ï„ = 1 to 12) and a significance level of 1%. It is also stated that TPINet effectively works when there are at least 200 data points. These details suggest that some level of parameter tuning may have been involved, but the specific optimization methods remain undisclosed.

Additionally, the study considered a maximum memory duration of the variables up to 6 hours to focus on sub-daily scale processes. This decision can be seen as a form of hyperparameter selection, but it does not provide insight into the optimization methods used for other hyperparameters.

In conclusion, while some level of hyperparameter tuning may have been applied, the provided context does not offer enough information to determine the specific optimization methods used for the TIPNet-based process network model.
