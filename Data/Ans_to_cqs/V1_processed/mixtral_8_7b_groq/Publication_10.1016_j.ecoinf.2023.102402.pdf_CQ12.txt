Based on the provided context, it is not explicitly stated which type of deep learning model, such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer, is used in the pipeline. However, it is mentioned that Maxent models were used for species distribution modeling. Maxent is a machine learning method that is used for predictive modeling, particularly for species distribution, and it is based on the principle of maximum entropy. While Maxent is not a deep learning model itself, it can be combined with deep learning techniques for feature extraction and data processing. Nonetheless, the specific type of deep learning model used in this study is not specified in the context.
