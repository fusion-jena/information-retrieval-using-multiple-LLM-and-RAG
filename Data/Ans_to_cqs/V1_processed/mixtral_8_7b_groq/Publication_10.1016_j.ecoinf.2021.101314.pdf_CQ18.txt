The strategy to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the performance of the model is evaluated by the accuracy of the generated redescriptions. 

In the first run, the model generated 271 redescriptions with strict explicit constraints. In the second run, the model generated 188 redescriptions with a stringent threshold on accuracy gains. The fact that the number of generated redescriptions is reported suggests that the performance of the model is being evaluated by the number of accurate redescriptions it produces. 

Additionally, the redescriptions are ranked by decreasing accuracy and any redescription having more than 90% of its support in common with a higher-ranked one is removed. This further indicates that the accuracy of the redescriptions is an important metric for evaluating the model's performance. 

However, the context does not mention how the accuracy of the redescriptions is calculated or how often the model's performance is evaluated during training. Therefore, while it can be inferred that the accuracy of the generated redescriptions is used to monitor the model's performance, the specific strategy is not provided.
