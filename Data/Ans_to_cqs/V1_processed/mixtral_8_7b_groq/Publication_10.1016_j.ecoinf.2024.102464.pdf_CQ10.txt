The provided context does not include information about a deep learning pipeline or any code repository links. The study mentioned utilizes data from natural environment surveys and applies seven machine learning models to assess the impact of urban development on species distribution. However, it does not specify the use of deep learning techniques nor provide any links to code repositories. Therefore, I'm unable to provide the requested link.
