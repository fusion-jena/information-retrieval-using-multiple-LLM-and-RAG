The provided context discusses the use of the Adam learning rate optimizer in a deep learning project for ocean object detection using synthetic aperture radar data. However, it does not explicitly mention any regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.

Regularization methods are techniques used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models by adding a penalty term to the loss function. This penalty term discourages the model from learning overly complex patterns in the training data that may not generalize well to new, unseen data.

Two common regularization methods used in deep learning are L2 regularization and dropout.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This encourages the model to learn smaller weights, which can help prevent overfitting by reducing the impact of individual features on the model's predictions.

Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly sets a fraction of the model's outputs to zero during training. This prevents the model from relying too heavily on any single neuron or feature, which can help prevent overfitting by encouraging the model to learn more robust and generalizable features.

Without explicit information from the provided context, it is not possible to say for certain which regularization methods were used in this deep learning project. However, it is common practice to use some combination of regularization techniques in deep learning to prevent overfitting and improve model generalization.
