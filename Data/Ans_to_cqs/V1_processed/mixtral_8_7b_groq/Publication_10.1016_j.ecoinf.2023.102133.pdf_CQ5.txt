The provided context does not give information about any of the standard datasets commonly used in deep learning, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it describes a specific study that uses several datasets for analyzing and predicting evapotranspiration in various land covers.

The datasets used in this study include weather data recorded by a weather station from January 2018 to November 2021 and micro-meteorological data acquired by an EC tower from March 2019 to November 2021. These datasets were used to estimate the reference evapotranspiration (ETo) using a specific equation and software. After processing, the records acquired by the EC tower were filtered based on the energy balance closure and rainfall height.

Additionally, the study used land cover data, such as pastures grass, different land cover, green peppers, corn, soybeans, potatoes, grassland, forest, alpine meadow, sawgrass, spontaneous flora, and citrus orchard. These datasets were used to analyze the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series and feature fusion of multi-source satellite imageries.

In summary, the provided context does not mention any of the standard deep learning datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it describes several datasets specific to the study of evapotranspiration and land cover analysis.
