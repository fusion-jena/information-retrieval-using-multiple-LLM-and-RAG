The provided context does not discuss specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet that are commonly used in deep learning pipelines. However, it does mention several studies that use different datasets to predict dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in water.

For instance, Heddam et al. (2022b) used a dataset of water quality parameters to predict DO concentration using a long-short term memory (LSTM) deep learning model. Similarly, Huan et al. (2017) proposed a DO prediction method based on a dataset of water quality parameters. Areerachakul et al. (2013) integrated unsupervised and supervised neural networks to predict DO concentration in canals using a dataset of water quality parameters. Ay and Kisi (2012) modeled DO concentration using different neural network techniques in Foundation Creek, El Paso County, Colorado, using a dataset of water quality parameters.

Moreover, the context also mentions a dataset as discussed in Liu et al. (2014) that can potentially cause poor predictive performance. However, it does not provide details about the dataset or its source.

Therefore, while the provided context does not directly answer the query about the specific datasets used in deep learning pipelines, it does show that various datasets of water quality parameters have been used in the deep learning literature to predict DO concentration.
