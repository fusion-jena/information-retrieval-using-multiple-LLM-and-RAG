The provided context does not contain information about regularization methods used in deep learning to prevent overfitting. However, I can provide a general answer to the query.


In deep learning, overfitting is a common issue where the model learns the training data too well, including its noise, and performs poorly on unseen data. Regularization methods are used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty to the loss function, which discourages the learning of overly complex models.

Two common regularization methods used in deep learning are L2 regularization and dropout.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the sum of the squares of the model's weights. This penalty term discourages large weights, which in turn reduces the complexity of the model and prevents overfitting.

Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly sets a fraction of the model's hidden units to zero during training. This prevents the co-adaptation of hidden units, which can lead to overfitting. Dropout effectively creates an ensemble of models, where each model uses a different subset of the hidden units. During inference, the outputs of all the models are averaged to obtain the final prediction.

These regularization methods can be used together or separately, depending on the complexity of the model and the amount of training data available. Other regularization methods include L1 regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation. The choice of regularization method depends on the specific problem and the characteristics of the data.
