In the context provided, there is no explicit mention of the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does discuss the feature normalization process in the vision transformer (ViT) model. Feature normalization is a technique used to change the range of input features to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms. In the ViT model, feature normalization is not recommended for identification tasks with poor image quality because it pays more attention to features with smaller modulus, which may not be beneficial for the model's performance.

Apart from feature normalization, there are other common preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. These include:

1. Data cleaning: This involves removing any irrelevant or missing data from the dataset. It is essential to ensure that the data used for training the model is accurate and complete.
2. Data scaling: This is the process of resizing the data to a specific range. Deep learning models are sensitive to the scale of the input features. Therefore, scaling the data to a particular range ensures that all the features have the same scale, which improves the model's performance.
3. Data normalization: This is the process of changing the range of input features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Normalization ensures that all the features have the same scale, which improves the model's performance.
4. Data augmentation: This involves increasing the size of the dataset by applying transformations such as rotation, scaling, and flipping to the existing data. Data augmentation helps improve the model's performance by reducing overfitting.

In summary, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include data cleaning, scaling, normalization, and augmentation. While the context provided does not explicitly mention these steps, it does discuss the feature normalization process in the ViT model.
