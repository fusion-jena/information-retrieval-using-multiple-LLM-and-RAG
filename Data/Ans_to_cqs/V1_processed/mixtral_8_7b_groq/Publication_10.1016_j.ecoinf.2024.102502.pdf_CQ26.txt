The provided context discusses data filtering, scaling, and workflow replicability in the context of environmental time series data, but it does not directly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer based on the given information.

However, I can provide some general insights on addressing data bias in preprocessing, which may be applicable to deep learning pipelines.

1. Stratified sampling: Stratified sampling can help ensure that the training, validation, and test datasets have a similar distribution of classes or labels as the original dataset. This technique can be useful when the dataset is imbalanced, and it can help prevent the deep learning model from being biased towards the majority class.
2. Oversampling and undersampling: Oversampling the minority class or undersampling the majority class can help balance the dataset. However, oversampling can lead to overfitting, while undersampling can result in loss of information. Synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) can be used to generate synthetic samples of the minority class, which can help balance the dataset without overfitting.
3. Diverse data collection: Collecting data from multiple sources or domains can help reduce bias and increase the robustness of the deep learning model. Diverse data collection can help ensure that the model is exposed to a wide variety of data, reducing the risk of overfitting to a particular dataset or domain.
4. Data augmentation: Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, scaling, and flipping can help increase the size of the dataset and reduce overfitting. These techniques can also help ensure that the model is exposed to a variety of data transformations, reducing the risk of bias towards a particular data transformation.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly address techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, techniques such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, diverse data collection, and data augmentation can help reduce bias and increase the robustness of the deep learning model.
