The provided context does not specify the use of a deep learning model for the task. Instead, it discusses the use of K-nearest neighbors regression for predicting potential natural vegetation (PNV) using the Scikit-learn library. The performance of this model is evaluated using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metric.

However, to answer the query regarding the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model, the following can be said:

Deep learning models can be evaluated using various metrics depending on the specific task. For a classification task, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are commonly used metrics. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of total predictions. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions. Recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positives. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.

For a regression task, metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are commonly used. MAE measures the average magnitude of the errors, MSE measures the average of the squared errors, and RMSE is the square root of MSE.

Therefore, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model depend on the specific task, whether it is a classification or regression task.
