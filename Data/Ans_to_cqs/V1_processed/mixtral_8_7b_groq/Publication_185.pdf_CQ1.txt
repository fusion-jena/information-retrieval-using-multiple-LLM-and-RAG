Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for butterfly classification or biodiversity research. However, it is mentioned that the experiments were performed on a small-size dataset, which implies that the data was collected through some means, but the context does not provide details on how this was done.

In general, there are various methods for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines, including but not limited to:

1. Surveys: Researchers can collect data through surveys, where participants provide information about the objects of interest. For example, in butterfly classification, surveys can be used to collect data about the types of butterflies seen in a particular area.
2. Sensors: Sensors can be used to collect data automatically, without human intervention. For example, cameras can be set up in a butterfly habitat to capture images of butterflies, which can then be used for classification.
3. Public datasets: Publicly available datasets can be used as a source of raw data for deep learning pipelines. For example, there are several public datasets available for image recognition tasks, such as ImageNet, which contains millions of images that can be used for training deep learning models.

Once the raw data is collected, it can be preprocessed and used for training deep learning models. In the context of butterfly classification, the raw data might consist of images of butterflies, which would need to be preprocessed by removing the background and normalizing the images before they can be used for training.

In summary, while the provided context does not provide specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for butterfly classification or biodiversity research, there are various methods that can be used for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines, including surveys, sensors, and public datasets.
