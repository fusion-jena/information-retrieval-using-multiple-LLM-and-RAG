The criteria used to determine when training is complete in the context provided is not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred that the training process for the models is likely determined by the performance on a validation or test dataset, which is a common practice in machine learning.

In the given context, there are several metrics reported for both the training and test datasets, such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). These metrics are used to assess the accuracy of the models in predicting the target variable. Typically, the training process is continued until the performance on the validation or test dataset stops improving or reaches a satisfactory level.

For instance, in the context, the RMSE and MAE values for both the training and test datasets are reported for multiple models. The model with the lowest RMSE and MAE values for the test dataset is likely the one that was selected as the final model, indicating that the training process was stopped when the model's performance on the test dataset was the best.

Moreover, the context also mentions the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Principal Component Regression (PCR), which are techniques used for dimensionality reduction and regression analysis, respectively. These techniques can be used to improve the model's performance by reducing the number of input variables or by transforming the input variables to better match the target variable's distribution.

In summary, while the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete in the provided context are not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that the training process is likely determined by the performance on a validation or test dataset, as indicated by the reported RMSE and MAE values for both the training and test datasets. Additionally, the use of PCA and PCR suggests that the training process may also involve techniques for dimensionality reduction and regression analysis.
