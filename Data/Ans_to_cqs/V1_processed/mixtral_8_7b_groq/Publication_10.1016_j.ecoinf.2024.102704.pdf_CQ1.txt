The provided context does not give a direct answer to the query, but it does mention some sources of data used in specific fish-related deep learning studies.

In Coro and Walsh (2021), an intelligent and cost-effective remote underwater video device was used for fish size monitoring. This suggests that video recordings from underwater cameras or sensors could be a source of raw data for deep learning pipelines.

Da Cunha et al. (2023) studied the selection of fish resources for consumption and sale by artisanal fishers. While the study does not explicitly mention data collection methods, it is likely that they used fisheries survey data or catch data reported by fishers.

Qin et al. (2022) developed a fish detection method based on multi-enhancement and output fusion of fuzzy underwater images. This implies that their raw data came from underwater cameras or sensors that captured fuzzy or low-quality images.

Rani et al. (2024) proposed a novel automated approach for fish biomass estimation in turbid environments. They used deep learning, object detection, and regression, but the context does not provide information on the source of their raw data.

In summary, the raw data for deep learning pipelines in fish-related studies can come from various sources, including underwater video recordings, fisheries survey data, and fuzzy underwater images. However, the context provided does not give a comprehensive overview of all the possible data collection methods used in fish-related deep learning studies.
