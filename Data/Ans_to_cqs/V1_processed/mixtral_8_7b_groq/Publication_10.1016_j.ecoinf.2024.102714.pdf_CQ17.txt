Based on the provided context, the text does not discuss the deep learning pipeline or regularization methods used to prevent overfitting, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The text focuses on the development of a machine learning model using the XGBoostClassifier algorithm for land cover classification. It describes the generation of training and testing datasets, input features, and the process of splitting polygons to minimize spatial autocorrelation. However, it does not mention any regularization techniques used in a deep learning context. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the given context.
