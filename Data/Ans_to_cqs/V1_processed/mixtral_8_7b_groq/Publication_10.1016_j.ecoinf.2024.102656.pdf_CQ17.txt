The provided context does not directly discuss the regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting, such as dropout and L2 regularization. However, it does describe an ensemble modeling framework that combines multiple statistical models to enhance predictive accuracy and mitigate uncertainties and biases. This approach is somewhat related to the concept of regularization, as it aims to reduce overfitting by combining the predictions of multiple models.

Regularization methods like dropout and L2 regularization are commonly used in deep learning to prevent overfitting. Dropout is a technique that randomly sets a fraction of the input units to zero during training, which helps to prevent co-adaptation of feature detectors (Srivastava et al., 2014). L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the model weights. This encourages the model to learn smaller weights, which can help to reduce overfitting (Ng, 2004).

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss the regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting, it does describe an ensemble modeling framework that is related to the concept of regularization. Regularization methods like dropout and L2 regularization are commonly used in deep learning to prevent overfitting by reducing the complexity of the model and encouraging it to learn more generalizable patterns.
