The context provided does not give specific information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It does not mention whether grid search, random search, or any other method was used for hyperparameter tuning. Hyperparameter tuning is an essential step in training machine learning models, including deep learning models, as it can significantly impact the model's performance.

Grid search and random search are two common methods for hyperparameter tuning. Grid search involves creating a grid of hyperparameter values and training the model with each combination. In contrast, random search involves randomly selecting hyperparameter values from a defined range and training the model with these values.

While the context does not provide information on hyperparameter tuning, it does mention that the model is a deep learning model used for forest species classification in hyperspectral images. The model's architecture, including the number of layers and neurons, is not provided, making it difficult to determine the hyperparameters that may require tuning.

Therefore, while the context provides information on the dataset used, the problem addressed, and the model architecture, it does not provide information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized.
