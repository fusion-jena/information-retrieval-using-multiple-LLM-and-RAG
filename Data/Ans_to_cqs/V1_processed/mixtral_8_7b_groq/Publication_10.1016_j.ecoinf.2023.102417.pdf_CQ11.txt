I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of deep learning methods for biocrust classification and the importance of creating training datasets, but it does not specify where the data or code for the pipeline can be found. Therefore, I am unable to provide the requested link. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
