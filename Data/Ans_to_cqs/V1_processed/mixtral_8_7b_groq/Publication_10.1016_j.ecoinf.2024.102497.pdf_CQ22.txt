The pieces of context provided do not specifically mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model for bathymetry estimation. However, in the field of machine learning and remote sensing, common metrics used to evaluate the performance of a model include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Accuracy is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions. It is a common metric used to evaluate the performance of a model, but it may not be the best metric for imbalanced datasets.

Precision is the ratio of true positives (correctly predicted positive samples) to the sum of true positives and false positives (incorrectly predicted positive samples). It measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made by the model.

Recall is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives (incorrectly predicted negative samples). It measures the proportion of true positive predictions made by the model out of all actual positive samples.

The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and it provides a balanced assessment of both metrics. It is a more robust metric than accuracy for imbalanced datasets.

In the context of bathymetry estimation, these metrics can be used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model by comparing the predicted depth values to the actual depth values. For example, accuracy can be used to measure the proportion of correctly predicted depth values, while precision and recall can be used to measure the proportion of true positive and true negative depth predictions, respectively.

In the paper by Najar et al. (2022), they compared the performance of a deep learning model with physics-based approaches for coastal bathymetry estimation using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. However, they did not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model.

Therefore, while the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model for bathymetry estimation are not provided in the context, common metrics used in machine learning and remote sensing include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
