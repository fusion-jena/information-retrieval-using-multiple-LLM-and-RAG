Based on the provided context, there are no specific details mentioned about the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the CNN models. However, it is mentioned that the models were fine-tuned using a validation set, which was formed by randomly sampling 100 ROIs per species from the remaining ROIs with species presence after setting aside a held-out test set of 50 ROIs per species for accuracy assessment.

The training set for fine-tuning the CNN models consisted of the remaining ROIs after the test and validation sets were formed. The average number of ROIs per species in the training set was 887, with a minimum of 349 and a maximum of 3094. It can be inferred that the models were likely trained until validation loss plateaued or until there were no significant improvements in model performance. However, the specific criteria used to determine training completion are not provided in the context.

Therefore, the answer to the query is:


 The provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete for the CNN models. It can be inferred that the models were likely trained until validation loss plateaued or until there were no significant improvements in model performance. However, the exact criteria used are not specified.
