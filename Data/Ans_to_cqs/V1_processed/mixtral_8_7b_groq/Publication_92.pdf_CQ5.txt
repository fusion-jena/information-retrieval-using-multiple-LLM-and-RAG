The context does not provide specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the system was tested on underwater videos for coral reef fish detection and recognition. Therefore, it can be inferred that the dataset used in this study consists of underwater video recordings of coral reef fish.

Additionally, the system uses transfer learning from the GoogLeNet architecture, which was pre-trained on the large-scale ImageNet dataset. The ImageNet dataset contains over 14 million images belonging to 1000 classes, and it is commonly used for object recognition and detection tasks.

Furthermore, the system adds three new classes to its initial thumbnail database: random/specific background, part of fish, and fish. The "random/specific background" class contains 116,820 samples of random underwater backgrounds and 91,247 samples of specific backgrounds. The "part of fish" class contains 55,848 samples, and the "fish" class contains 970 samples. These classes were added to improve the localization accuracy and to ensure that the network processes the fish as a whole rather than focusing on distinctive parts.

In summary, while the context does not provide specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that underwater video recordings of coral reef fish were used for training and testing the system. Additionally, the system uses transfer learning from the ImageNet dataset and adds three new classes to its initial thumbnail database.
