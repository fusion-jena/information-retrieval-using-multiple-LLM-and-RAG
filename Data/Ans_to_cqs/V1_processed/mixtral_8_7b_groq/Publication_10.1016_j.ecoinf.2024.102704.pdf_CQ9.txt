Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The context includes several research papers related to deep learning and fish species detection, but it does not mention where the dataset used in these studies is stored or shared.

The papers by Li et al. (2018, 2022a, 2022b) and Wang et al. (2019, 2020) discuss various aspects of deep learning models for fish species detection and optimization techniques for improving computational efficiency. However, they do not provide any information about the data repository.

Therefore, it is not possible to answer this query without additional information. If the data repository is not mentioned in the papers, it may be helpful to contact the authors directly to inquire about the availability and location of the dataset.
