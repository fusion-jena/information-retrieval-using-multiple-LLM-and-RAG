Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer some information about the data preprocessing steps from the given figures and text.

Firstly, the dataset is segmented into 5-second spectrograms (Fig. 2), and a pre-trained feature extraction model generates 527-dimensional embedding vectors for each segment. This suggests that the data has been preprocessed using a feature extraction technique, possibly using a domain-specific model.

Secondly, the authors compare three classification models, ResNet-50, Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST), and HuBERT, trained on a dataset containing 3000 5-second segments, including 1130 possum vocalizations and 1870 noise sources (Section 4.1). The dataset has an 80/20% training-validation split, and 500 segments are separated into a test set containing 187 possum vocalizations and 313 noise samples. This implies that the dataset has been split into training, validation, and test sets, ensuring that the model is evaluated on unseen data. However, the text does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during this splitting process, such as stratified sampling.

The context also discusses the use of transfer learning (Fig. 3) and prototypical learning (Fig. 4) in the deep learning pipeline. While these techniques can help improve model performance, they do not directly address data bias during preprocessing.

In summary, while the provided context offers insights into the data preprocessing steps and the deep learning pipeline, it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, such as oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.
