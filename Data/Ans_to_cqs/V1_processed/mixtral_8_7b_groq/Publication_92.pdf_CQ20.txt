The context does not provide specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it mentions that deep learning has been made possible by new computational power accessible through latest GPU. This suggests that GPUs are likely used for training the deep learning model in this case. It is also possible that other hardware resources, such as TPUs (Tensor Processing Units), are used, but the context does not provide enough information to confirm this.
