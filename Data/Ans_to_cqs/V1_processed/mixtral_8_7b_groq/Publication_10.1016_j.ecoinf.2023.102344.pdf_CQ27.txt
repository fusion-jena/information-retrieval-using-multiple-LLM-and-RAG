The text provided does not give specific details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does provide information about the training of the models.

The training of the models was conducted using pre-trained networks with numerical inputs through Approach 1. The models used were EfficientNet-B0, ResNet101, MobileNetV2, and InceptionV3. The training configuration was set to an initial learning rate of 0.001, with an every-epoch shuffle technique, and the shortest sequence length. All pre-trained models under Approach 3 converged the training after 1000 epochs with SGDM as the optimization algorithm.

In terms of model serialization, the text does not provide specific details. However, it is common practice to save a trained model's architecture and weights to a file, which can be loaded later for making predictions. This process is called model serialization.

As for platform selection, the text does not provide information on where the model was deployed or the hardware used for deployment. Typically, deep learning models can be deployed on various platforms, ranging from local machines to cloud-based services, depending on the use case and resource requirements.

Therefore, while the text provides information on the training of the models, it does not give specific details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
