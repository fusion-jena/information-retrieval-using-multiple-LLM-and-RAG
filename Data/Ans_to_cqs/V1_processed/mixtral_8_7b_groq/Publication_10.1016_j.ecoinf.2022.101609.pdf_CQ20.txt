The specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model are GPUs (Graphics Processing Units). This is indicated in the context by the use of GPU instances for testing the scalability of the REVIS system. In addition, Fig. 14 compares the performance of bare metal and GPU instances as the number of devices is increased, further emphasizing the use of GPUs for the deep learning model. However, the specific type of GPU used is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. It can be inferred that the GPU used for the test run between November 2020 and January 2021, as mentioned in the beginning, is a Pascal GPU2.1 with 1 NVIDIA P100 and 16GB GPU memory, as mentioned in Table 4.

Another indication of the use of GPUs for training the deep learning model is in Fig. 13, which shows the captured NO2 pollutant readings (blue highlight) and the deep learning model predictions (red highlight). The fact that these results were derived from an evaluation using the validation dataset suggests that the model's predictions were made using the GPU resources available on the Oracle cloud instances.

In summary, the deep learning model was trained using GPUs, specifically the Pascal GPU2.1 with 1 NVIDIA P100 and 16GB GPU memory.
