The provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. However, it does describe techniques used to prevent potential performance degradation and overfitting in random forest models, which are a type of machine learning algorithm.

In the context, two feature elimination techniques are used to improve the performance of random forest models: Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Variable Selection Using Random Forests (VSURF). RFE iteratively removes one variable at a time and evaluates its impact on model performance until it reaches the best predefined level of performance. VSURF goes a step further by assessing how important variables contribute to predicting the response variable and retains only those that lead to a reduction in prediction error.

While these techniques do not directly address randomness in deep learning pipelines, they do demonstrate strategies for improving model performance and preventing overfitting. In deep learning pipelines, randomness can be introduced through various factors such as the initialization of weights, dropout regularization, and data shuffling. Strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines can include setting a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility, using techniques such as cross-validation to assess model performance, and applying regularization methods to prevent overfitting.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, it does provide insight into techniques for improving model performance and preventing overfitting in machine learning algorithms. Strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines can include setting a fixed random seed value, using cross-validation, and applying regularization methods.
