The provided context does not give specific information about the learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model. However, it does mention that a pre-trained CNN feature extractor was used and fine-tuned for 10 epochs. The fine-tuning process would have involved adjusting some hyperparameters, but the specific learning rate and optimizer are not provided.

The context does give some information about other hyperparameters used in the pre-processing stage, such as low pass filter cut off, downsampling rate, Nyquist rate, and segment duration. These hyperparameters are used for data preprocessing before inputting the data into the deep learning model.

In addition, the context mentions that the deep learning model was applied to four different datasets (Lemurs, Alethe, Gibbons, and Whydah) with varying numbers of testing files and testing times. However, the specific hyperparameters used for each dataset are not provided.

Overall, while the context provides some information about the hyperparameters used in the pre-processing stage and the general fine-tuning process, it does not give specific details about the learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model.
