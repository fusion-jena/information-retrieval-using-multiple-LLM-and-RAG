Unfortunately, there is no code repository link provided in the given pieces of context regarding the deep learning pipeline for detecting and classifying man-made marine objects (MMOs). The sources mention various studies and techniques used for detecting and classifying MMOs, but they do not include any links to code repositories.

Abu et al. (2022) propose a contour-based features analysis method for underwater MMO detection, while Han et al. (2022) propose a deep learning technique called LCSE-ResNet for detecting, classifying, and locating vessels and oil platforms in remote optical imagery. However, neither of these sources provides a code repository link.

In some cases, researchers may not publicly share their code due to various reasons, such as intellectual property concerns or ongoing research. If you are interested in implementing these techniques, you may consider reaching out to the authors directly to inquire about the availability of the code.
