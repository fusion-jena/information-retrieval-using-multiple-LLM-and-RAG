Based on the provided context, there is no explicit description of a strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, there are some details about the training process and parameter tuning that can give us some insights into how the model performance might have been indirectly monitored.

Firstly, the model training was done for 110 epochs, where each epoch was composed of 4800 training samples. This means that the model's performance could have been observed after each epoch, and the training could have been stopped early if the model's performance on a validation set was not improving. This is a common practice in machine learning known as early stopping.

Secondly, the XGBoost model parameters were tuned using grid search functions to find the optimal value when judged by the test error metric. This process involves training multiple models with different parameter values and evaluating their performance on a separate test set. The parameters that resulted in the best performance on the test set were then selected for the final model. This approach can be seen as a way of monitoring the model's performance during the parameter tuning phase.

Lastly, the authors mentioned that they wanted to err on the side of conservative model building since they knew there was little power in the inputs to discriminate between wetland classes. This suggests that they might have been careful not to overfit the model to the training data, which is another way of monitoring the model's performance during training. Overfitting can be detected by observing the model's performance on a validation set and ensuring that it does not decrease as the model becomes more complex.

In summary, while there is no explicit description of a strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training, the details provided about the training process and parameter tuning suggest that the authors might have used early stopping, test set evaluation, and careful model selection to indirectly monitor the model's performance during training.
