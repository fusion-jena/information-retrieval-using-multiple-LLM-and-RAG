The preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model for burned area detection in the Cerrado biome using Landsat 8 imagery are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that some preprocessing was performed on the Landsat 8 satellite images.

Firstly, the study used specific spectral bands from Landsat 8 for the classification model of burned areas, including red (RED - 0.65 μm), near-infrared (NIR - 0.86 μm), and shortwave infrared (SWIR 1 - 1.6 μm and SWIR 2 - 2.2 μm). This suggests that the images were preprocessed to extract these specific bands.

Secondly, the study also tested the use of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), and Delta Normalized Burn Ratio (DNBR) in the classification model. These indices are commonly used in remote sensing and require preprocessing steps such as calculating the difference between two bands or normalizing the data.

Lastly, the study collected spectral training samples of burned and non-burned areas for the entire study area, which were used to train the deep learning models. The collection of training samples may also involve preprocessing steps such as cleaning or normalizing the data.

Therefore, while the specific preprocessing steps are not mentioned, it can be inferred that the Landsat 8 images underwent some preprocessing such as extracting specific spectral bands, calculating vegetation indices, and collecting spectral training samples.
