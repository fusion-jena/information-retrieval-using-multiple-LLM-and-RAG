The provided context does not give specific information about the use of a deep learning model in the study. However, it does mention some measures taken to ensure the quality and reliability of the data used in the analysis.

To enhance the quality and reliability of the information, a comprehensive series of filters was systematically applied to the dataset. These filters were used to minimize errors associated with the public usage of GBIF and OBIS repositories. The dataset was curated by following Zizka et al. (2020) and filtering the dataset by the columns labeled “scientific name”, “family”, “year”, “longitude” and “latitude”. The dataset was then refined by retaining all taxonomic information down to the species level and removing records with NA in these columns. Additionally, all duplicate records with identical latitude and longitude were removed.

Furthermore, the study aimed to understand the distribution of sampling efforts across space and time, which is a required step to interpret biodiversity patterns and reduce biases. This was achieved through different weighting schemes for records in areas with sufficient sampling, providing a more reliable contribution compared to underrepresented regions.

However, there is no information provided about the use of measures such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, which are typically used to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to answer this question without additional information.
