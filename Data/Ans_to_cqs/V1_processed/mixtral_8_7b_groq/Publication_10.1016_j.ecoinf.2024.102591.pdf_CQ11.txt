The provided context does not include information about a deep learning pipeline or a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. The context focuses on the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) for wildfire science, including the facilitation of access to a large remote sensing data catalog and the application of machine learning algorithms. However, it does not mention any deep learning pipeline or data repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information.
