The provided context does not directly discuss strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of stochastic processes in functional data analysis (FDA), which involves statistical methods for analyzing data that are functional, shape, or of complex structure. In this context, a stochastic process is a sequence of random variables, and the analysis involves accounting for the randomness in the data.

In the deep learning pipeline, randomness can be introduced in various ways, such as through the use of random initial weights, dropout regularization, and data augmentation. These techniques help to prevent overfitting, improve generalization, and increase the robustness of the model.

One common strategy to handle randomness is the use of a fixed random seed value. This ensures that the same sequence of random numbers is generated every time the model is trained, making the training process reproducible. This is important for scientific research, where reproducibility is crucial for validating results.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does mention the use of stochastic processes in FDA. In the deep learning pipeline, randomness can be introduced in various ways, and strategies such as using a fixed random seed value can help to handle this randomness.
