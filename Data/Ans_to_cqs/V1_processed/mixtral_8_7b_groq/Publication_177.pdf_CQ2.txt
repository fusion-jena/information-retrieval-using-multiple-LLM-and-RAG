The deep learning pipeline in the context provided utilizes image data formats for plant species identification. The study involves two datasets, UBD\_45 and VP\_200, which consist of examples of various plant species. Fig. 3 shows example plants from the UBD\_45 dataset.

The images in these datasets are used as input for deep learning models to classify the plant species. The researchers utilized pre-trained ImageNet weights and fine-tuned them to the specific datasets. Bayesian optimization was employed to find the optimal values for batch size and initial learning rate for each of the six models used in the study.

The datasets were split into training, validation, and testing sets, with 60% for training, 20% for validation, and 20% for testing. The training process involved using 40% of the images for testing, while the final distribution of the dataset was 60% for training, 20% for validation, and 20% for testing.

Therefore, the deep learning pipeline in this study uses image data formats for plant species identification, specifically for the classification of various plant species in the UBD\_45 and VP\_200 datasets.
