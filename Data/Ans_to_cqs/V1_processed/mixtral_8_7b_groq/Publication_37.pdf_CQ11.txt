The provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text focuses on the comparison of two state-of-the-art classification techniques for large-vocabulary bird species classification from flight calls, but it does not mention where the data is stored or how to access it. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to the data repository.
