The provided context does not directly discuss strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of a random seed value in the context of Random Forest models, a type of machine learning algorithm.

In Random Forest models, a random seed value is used to determine the initial conditions of the model, such as the random sampling of data and the selection of features for each decision tree in the forest. This helps to ensure that the results of the model are reproducible and not influenced by arbitrary factors.

In deep learning, randomness can be handled in a similar way by setting a random seed value at the beginning of the training process. This ensures that the initialization of weights and biases, the order of data presentation, and other sources of randomness are consistent across multiple runs of the model.

Additionally, techniques such as dropout, data augmentation, and batch normalization can be used to introduce controlled randomness into the deep learning pipeline. Dropout randomly sets a fraction of the neurons in a layer to zero during training, which helps to prevent overfitting and improve generalization. Data augmentation generates new training examples by applying random transformations to the existing data, which can improve the model's ability to handle variations in the input. Batch normalization normalizes the inputs to each layer of the model, which can reduce the impact of random initialization and improve the stability of the training process.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in deep learning, it does mention the use of a random seed value in Random Forest models. In deep learning, a random seed value can be used to ensure reproducibility, while techniques such as dropout, data augmentation, and batch normalization can be used to introduce controlled randomness into the training process.
