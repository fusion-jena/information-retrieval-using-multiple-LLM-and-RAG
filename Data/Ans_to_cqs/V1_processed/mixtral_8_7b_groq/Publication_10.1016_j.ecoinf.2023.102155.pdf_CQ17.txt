The provided context discusses penalized regression techniques such as lasso regression, ridge regression, and elastic net regression, which are used to prevent overfitting and reduce coefficient instability in statistical models. However, the context does not mention any regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization.

Dropout is a regularization technique used in deep learning models to prevent overfitting. It works by randomly dropping out, or setting to zero, a proportion of the neurons in a layer during training. This helps to break up co-adaptations between neurons and encourages the model to learn more robust features.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is another regularization technique used in deep learning models. It works by adding a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This encourages the model to keep its weights small, which can help to prevent overfitting.

In summary, the provided context discusses penalized regression techniques used to prevent overfitting in statistical models, but it does not mention any regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines. Dropout and L2 regularization are two common regularization techniques used in deep learning models to prevent overfitting.
