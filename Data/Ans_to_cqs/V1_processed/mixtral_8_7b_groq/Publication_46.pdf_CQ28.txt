The provided context does not contain information about the specific platform or cloud service (such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform) that was used to deploy the deep learning model. The text focuses on the comparison of the deep learning-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and the traditional BIOCLIM model for species distribution modeling (SDM). It explains how the CNN outperformed the BIOCLIM model in predicting the probability distribution of the Rhododendron arboreum plant species in the Himalayas.

The CNN model was tested and proven to perform better than the BIOCLIM model using evaluation metrics like Area Under Curve (AUC), kappa, and True Skill Statistics (TSS). However, there is no mention of the cloud platform or infrastructure used to deploy the deep learning model.
