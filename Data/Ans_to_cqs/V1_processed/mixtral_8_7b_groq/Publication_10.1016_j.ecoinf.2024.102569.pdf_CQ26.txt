The provided context discusses methods for addressing data bias in the context of presence-only (PO) data analysis in ecological informatics, rather than specifically in the context of deep learning preprocessing. However, some of the mentioned techniques are relevant to data preprocessing in general and could be applied in deep learning pipelines.

The context highlights the importance of addressing sampling bias in PO data due to heterogeneity in sampling efforts. Several methods are discussed to identify and estimate the effect of bias on presence and then thin or eliminate it. The paper focuses on the thinned Point Process Process (PPP) model introduced in the next section.

Techniques mentioned in the context that can be related to data preprocessing in deep learning pipelines include:

1. Dataset filtering methods: The target-group background method (Phillips et al., 2009) and spatial thinning (Veloz, 2009) are employed to mitigate sampling bias. These methods can be combined with the proposed method to improve data quality during preprocessing.
2. Spatial dependence models: In cases of spatial dependence or autocorrelation in species distribution, the proposed estimator can be used to train spatial dependence models such as the area-interaction process (Baddeley and van Lieshout, 1995). This can help account for spatial dependencies in the data during preprocessing.
3. Mixed-effects models: Further research is needed to develop a robust estimation method for mixed-effects models such as the Cox process (MÃ¸ller et al., 1998). These models can be useful for incorporating both fixed and random effects in deep learning pipelines.

While the context does not explicitly mention techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, these methods can still be relevant for deep learning preprocessing. Stratified splitting can help ensure a balanced representation of classes in the training, validation, and test sets. Oversampling and undersampling can be used to address class imbalance issues. Diverse data collection aims to gather data from various sources and distributions, which can help improve model generalization in deep learning pipelines.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss deep learning preprocessing techniques, it highlights the importance of addressing data bias and suggests several methods that can be applied in deep learning preprocessing pipelines, such as dataset filtering, spatial dependence models, and mixed-effects models. Additionally, general data preprocessing techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection can also be relevant for deep learning applications.
