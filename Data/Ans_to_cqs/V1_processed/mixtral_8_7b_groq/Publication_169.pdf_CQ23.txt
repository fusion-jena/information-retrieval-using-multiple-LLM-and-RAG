Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some implicit indications that suggest that cross-validation or stratified splitting might have been used.

Firstly, the context mentions that the training process took around 10 hours on the CPU and reached an accuracy of 95% on 140 epochs. This suggests that the model was trained on a sufficiently large dataset, as training on a small dataset would typically be faster and require fewer epochs to converge.

Secondly, the context mentions that the proposed CNN-LSTM model performs better in classifying plant species than the conventional CNN, achieving an accuracy of 95.06% compared to 91% reported in the literature. This comparison suggests that the proposed model was evaluated on a separate dataset, which is a common practice in machine learning to ensure the generalizability of the model.

Finally, the context mentions that the model sorts the plant species images through a fully connected layer to predict whether they belong under any of the 100 categories of the plant species. This implies that the model was trained on a dataset with a diverse set of plant species, which is important to ensure the generalizability of the model.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention the use of cross-validation or stratified splitting, the implicit indications suggest that these measures might have been taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
