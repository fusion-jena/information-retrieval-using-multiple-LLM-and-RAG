The performance of the deep learning model was evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall. The model's accuracy was reported to be 92.2%, indicating that it correctly classified 92.2% of the given data. Precision and recall were also used to assess the model's performance, with precision being 92.6% and recall being 91.5%. Precision is the number of true positives relative to true and false positives, while recall is the number of true positives relative to true positives and false negatives. These metrics provide a more comprehensive understanding of the model's performance, as they consider both the true positive rate and the false positive rate. Additionally, the dataset used in the study was well-balanced, with approximately half of the images containing at least one animal and the other half having no animals.
