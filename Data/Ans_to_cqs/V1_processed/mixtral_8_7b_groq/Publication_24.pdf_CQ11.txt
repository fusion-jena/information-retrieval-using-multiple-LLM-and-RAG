The provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The context includes the citation of an article by Fairbrass et al. (2019) that presents CityNet, a deep learning tool for urban ecoacoustic assessment. However, it does not provide a link to the data repository used in the study.

The context also includes citations of other relevant articles and resources related to deep learning, audio classification, and soundscape synthesis. These resources may be useful for understanding the methods used in the study but do not provide information about the data repository link.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
