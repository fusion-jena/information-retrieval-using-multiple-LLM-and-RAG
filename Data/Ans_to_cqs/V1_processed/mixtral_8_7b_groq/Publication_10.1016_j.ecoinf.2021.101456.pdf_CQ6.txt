Based on the provided context, there are no specific preprocessing steps mentioned for the training of a deep learning model. However, it is generally a common practice to perform certain preprocessing techniques on the data before training a deep learning model. These preprocessing techniques include:

1. Normalization: This involves scaling the input data to a range of [0,1] or standardizing it to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Normalization helps in improving the training process by making the optimization landscape smoother and preventing the exploding/vanishing gradient problem.
2. Scaling: This is similar to normalization, but it involves scaling the data to a specific range or according to a particular distribution. Scaling is useful when the input features have different scales or units.
3. Cleaning: This involves removing any noise, outliers, or missing values from the data. Cleaning the data is essential to ensure that the model learns from high-quality data and makes accurate predictions.

In the given context, it can be inferred that the data is preprocessed before training the deep learning models. Specifically, for the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model, the input data is represented as a matrix X of size N x F, where N is the number of samples and F is the number of features. The encoder neural network approximates the true posterior density p(z|x) with a multivariate Gaussian, qθ(z|x) ∼ N (μθ, σ2θ ). This suggests that some form of preprocessing, such as normalization or scaling, may have been applied to the input data before it was fed into the encoder network.

Furthermore, it is mentioned that the clustering performance on the labelled test set for the unsupervised and semi-supervised instances of the dynamic β-VAE is presented in Table 2. This implies that the data is labeled, and any preprocessing techniques, such as cleaning or feature engineering, may have been applied to the data before training the model.

Therefore, while the specific preprocessing steps are not mentioned in the given context, it is reasonable to assume that some form of preprocessing, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning, was performed on the data before training the deep learning models.
