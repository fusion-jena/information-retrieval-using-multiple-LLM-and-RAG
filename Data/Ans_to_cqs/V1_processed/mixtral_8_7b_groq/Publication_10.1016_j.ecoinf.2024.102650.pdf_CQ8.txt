Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context includes several research papers and websites, but none of them mention or provide a link to the code repository for a deep learning pipeline. The papers focus on topics such as text classification, knowledge mining, air quality improvement, named entity recognition, and public participation in environmental governance. They describe various methods and techniques but do not provide any code repositories. Therefore, I cannot provide the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline.
