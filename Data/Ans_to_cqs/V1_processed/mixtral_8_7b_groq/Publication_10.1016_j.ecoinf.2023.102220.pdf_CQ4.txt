Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling being applied in the described deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the use of a long short-term memory (LSTM) block added to a deep neural network (DNN) with the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function for the hidden layers and sigmoid activation function for the output layer. The classification methods were implemented in Python using TensorFlow and Scikit-learn libraries.

The context mainly discusses the comparison of machine learning methods, including Support Vector Machines, Deep Neural Networks, Long Short Term Memory, and Random Forests, and introduces the Priority-Based Prediction (PBP) method, which provides interpretability and descriptive advantages combined with its predictive power. The interpretability of PBP allows for clear interpretations of each hyperparameter and the creation of visual representations of patterns that occurred before the outbreak (the P' means matrix). However, it does not mention any data augmentation techniques.

In summary, there is no information in the provided context about data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling being applied in the described deep learning pipeline.
