The purpose of the deep learning model in the study "Verification of novel integrations of swarm intelligence algorithms into deep learning neural network for flood susceptibility mapping" is to classify areas according to their flood susceptibility. The study aims to improve the accuracy of flood susceptibility mapping by integrating swarm intelligence algorithms into a deep learning neural network. The model is trained to classify different areas based on various factors that contribute to flood susceptibility. This information can be valuable for flood risk management and urban planning.
