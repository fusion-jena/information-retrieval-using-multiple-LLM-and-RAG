Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context focuses on the use of species observation data, including data from a public authoritative repository of big data (GBIF) and reliable records observed in the field, to build a robust distribution model for a specific species. It also discusses the indications for policy-making authorities, data limitations, and advantages and drawbacks of the model prediction beyond the training ranges. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
