The provided context does not specify where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that the statistical analyses were conducted with R 4.1.0 and the CNN model was trained with TensorFlow 2.5.0 libraries. However, it does not mention any data repository or data availability sources such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
