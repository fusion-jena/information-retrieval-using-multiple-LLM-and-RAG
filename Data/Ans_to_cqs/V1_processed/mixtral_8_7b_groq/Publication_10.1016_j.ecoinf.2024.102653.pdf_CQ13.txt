The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are presented in Table 1 of the provided context. The model utilizes the ADAM optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2017) with a learning rate of 0.003. The batch size is set to 32, and the model is trained over 100 epochs. A dropout rate of 0.5 is used to prevent overfitting, and the binary cross-entropy loss function is employed.
