Based on the provided context, the text does not directly answer the query regarding the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some sources of data that could be used for deep learning.

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to model and solve complex problems. The raw data used in deep learning can come from various sources, including surveys, sensors, and public datasets.

Surveys are a common method for collecting data in many fields. They can be conducted online, on paper, or in person, and can gather data on a wide range of topics. In the context of deep learning, surveys could be used to collect data on people's opinions, behaviors, or other relevant information.

Sensors are another source of raw data for deep learning. Sensors can measure a wide range of phenomena, such as temperature, pressure, motion, and more. In the context of deep learning, sensors could be used to collect data on physical systems, such as machines, buildings, or environmental conditions.

Public datasets are also a valuable source of raw data for deep learning. These datasets are often collected and maintained by government agencies, research institutions, or other organizations. They can cover a wide range of topics, from healthcare and finance to transportation and education. In the context of deep learning, public datasets could be used to train models on large, diverse datasets, which can improve their accuracy and generalizability.

Overall, while the provided context does not directly answer the query, it does suggest that surveys, sensors, and public datasets are all potential sources of raw data for deep learning. The specific methods used will depend on the problem being solved and the available data.
