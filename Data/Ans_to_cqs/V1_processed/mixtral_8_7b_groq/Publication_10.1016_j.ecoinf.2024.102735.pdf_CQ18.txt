In the study, the model performance was monitored during training by dividing all the datasets randomly into two sets, with 80% for training the RF and SVR models and 20% for testing the model. The training set was further randomly sampled to select a training and validation set to obtain optimized model hyperparameters. This strategy allowed for the models to be trained and validated using different subsets of the data, ensuring that the models were not overfitting to the training data and were able to generalize well to unseen data.

Additionally, the study implemented hyperparameter tuning to further monitor the model performance during training. The model structures were kept the same, and the Optuna package was used to realize optimized parameters for each modeling scenario. The distribution of the parameters slightly varies with each modeling scenario, indicating the need for different numbers of regression trees for different models. This process helped in selecting the best set of hyperparameters for the models, which in turn improved the model performance during training.

Furthermore, the study used high-frequency continuous surface water quality data acquired from water quality sensors deployed in Boyd Millpond by the Land Development Division of Greenville County, SC. The use of high-frequency data enabled the realization of optimized parameters using the Optuna package, which helped in monitoring the model performance during training.

Overall, the study implemented a robust strategy to monitor the model performance during training by dividing the data into training and testing sets, implementing hyperparameter tuning, and using high-frequency continuous surface water quality data. This strategy ensured that the models were not overfitting to the training data and were able to generalize well to unseen data, thereby improving the model performance during training.
