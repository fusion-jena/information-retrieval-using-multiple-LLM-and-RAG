The provided context discusses the training of machine learning models, specifically random forest models, for predicting water quality parameters such as chlorophyll-a. However, it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline.

That being said, some common techniques used to address data bias in machine learning and deep learning include:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on certain criteria, such as class labels, and then ensuring that each subgroup is represented proportionally in the training and testing sets.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of instances of the minority class in the dataset to balance it with the majority class.
3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class in the dataset to balance it with the minority class.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from various sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population.

While the context does not explicitly mention these techniques, it does discuss the importance of using high-frequency datasets during the model training phase to enable the RF model to learn more patterns in the water quality datasets efficiently. This suggests that the authors may have employed techniques such as oversampling or undersampling to balance the dataset and improve model performance.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of the random forest model with and without the inclusion of chlorophyll-a sensor values as a predictor variable. This approach can be seen as a form of data augmentation, where additional features are added to the dataset to improve model performance.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, it suggests that the authors may have employed techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, or data augmentation to improve model performance.
