Based on the provided context, there is no information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The text discusses the use of the Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM) neural network approach for dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis, as well as the identification of ecological sources and barriers using various methods such as the Davis-Boldin Index (DBI) and hotspot analysis. However, it does not mention any details about the data splitting criteria for deep learning model training. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
