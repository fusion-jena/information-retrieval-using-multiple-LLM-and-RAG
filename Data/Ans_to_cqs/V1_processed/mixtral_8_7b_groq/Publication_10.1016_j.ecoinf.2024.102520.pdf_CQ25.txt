Based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated. However, there are some clues in the first piece of context about the study's use of remote sensing image processing and the Landsat 8 OLI and TIRS bands. These bands are often used for land use and land cover classification, so it is possible that the deep learning model is being used for this purpose.

Additionally, the second piece of context describes a study that used machine learning to alleviate Hubbard-model sign problems. While this study did not use deep learning, it suggests that machine learning techniques are being applied to physical sciences problems.

The third piece of context discusses land use and land cover in a specific region, with agricultural, horticultural, and forest land making up the majority of the area. This context could be related to the first piece of context if the deep learning model is being used for land use and land cover classification.

Therefore, based on the available context, it is likely that the deep learning model is being used for land use and land cover classification. However, further information is needed to confirm this hypothesis.
