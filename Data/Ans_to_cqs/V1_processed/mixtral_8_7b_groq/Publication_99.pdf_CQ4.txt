In the provided context, data augmentation techniques are mentioned in the section about the training of the classification networks. However, specific techniques such as rotation or scaling are not explicitly listed. Instead, the following techniques are described:

1. Height and width shift: This technique involves shifting the image horizontally or vertically by a certain number of pixels. This can help the model generalize better to images that may be slightly offset or translated.
2. Flipping: This technique involves flipping the image horizontally or vertically. This can help the model learn symmetries in the data and prevent overfitting to the orientation of the training images.
3. Zooming: This technique involves zooming in or out on the image by a certain factor. This can help the model learn to recognize features at different scales and prevent overfitting to the size of the training images.
4. Brightness changes: This technique involves changing the brightness of the image by a certain factor. This can help the model learn to recognize features under different lighting conditions and prevent overfitting to the lighting of the training images.

Therefore, while the specific techniques of rotation and scaling are not mentioned, the description of the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline includes height and width shift, flipping, zooming, and brightness changes.
