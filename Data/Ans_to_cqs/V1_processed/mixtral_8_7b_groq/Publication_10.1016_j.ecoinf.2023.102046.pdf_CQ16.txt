The provided context does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the models used in the study. However, it does mention that hyperparameter search was performed for classification and regression models to identify the right level of regularization. This implies that the training process for these models may have been guided by a validation set, and training could have been stopped when the validation loss plateaued or showed only minor improvements over a certain number of epochs.

In the context of few-shot learning, the study mentions that the approach can help to make up for the lack of labeled data available for training. This suggests that the training process for few-shot learning models may be different from traditional models, as they are trained on a small number of labeled sample images. However, the context does not provide specific details about the training criteria used for few-shot learning models.

In summary, while the provided context suggests that validation loss plateauing or minor improvements over a certain number of epochs may have been used as criteria to determine when training is complete for some of the models used in the study, it does not provide specific information about the training criteria used for all models.
