In the context provided, there is no detailed information about how the data was split for training, testing, and validation of the deep learning model, which is an artificial neural network (ANN) in this case. However, it is mentioned that the dataset contained 89 valid records, and one record represented the mean value of the total 10 spot measurements on one leaf. Furthermore, it is stated that the dataset was divided into a "training dataset" containing 60 randomly selected records and a "testing dataset" that contained the remaining 29 records.

For the ANN model, the training dataset was used to fit the model, and the testing dataset was used for further validation of the model's performance. However, the text does not explicitly mention a validation dataset. Instead, the ANN model was run 100 times, and the residuals from each run were analyzed for a more reliable evaluation of the model performance.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the criteria used to split the data for the ANN model training were a "training dataset" containing 60 randomly selected records and a "testing dataset" that contained the remaining 29 records. However, there is no information about a separate validation dataset for the ANN model.
