The deep learning pipeline can handle various data formats, including images, audio, video, and CSV files, among others. However, the provided context focuses mainly on the use of images in the deep learning pipeline for animal recognition and counting tasks.

In the context, UAV thermal images are used as input data for object detection and counting of animals. These images are processed through a deep learning pipeline that involves feature extraction, region proposal, and object detection. Specifically, a feature map extractor based on Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and ResNet152 extracts five feature maps from the original UAV thermal image, each with different resolutions (256 × 320, 128 × 160, 64 × 80, 32 × 40, and 16 × 20). These feature maps are then used by the region proposal network to generate RoIs (Regions of Interest) of different sizes.

Therefore, in the context provided, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is a UAV thermal image. However, it is worth noting that deep learning models can handle various data formats, and the choice of data format depends on the specific task and application. For instance, in natural language processing, CSV or text files are commonly used, while in audio processing, audio files are used as input data. Similarly, in video processing, video files are used as input data.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline can handle various data formats, including images, audio, video, and CSV files. The provided context focuses on the use of UAV thermal images in the deep learning pipeline for animal recognition and counting tasks.
