Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model for predicting means, standard deviations (SDs), and population sizes, or for species identification.

However, the context does mention the use of Bayesian algorithms to improve the performance of software attempting automated bat ID. Bayesian methods are a broad class of statistical algorithms that rely on Bayes' theorem to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. Hyperparameters in Bayesian models can include prior distributions, likelihood functions, and the number of iterations for the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithm.

In general, deep learning models have several hyperparameters that need to be tuned for optimal performance. Some common hyperparameters include:

1. Learning rate: This controls the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function.
2. Optimizer: This is the algorithm used to update the weights and biases in the model based on the gradient of the loss function. Examples include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop.
3. Number of layers and neurons: The architecture of the deep learning model, including the number of layers and the number of neurons in each layer, can significantly impact the model's performance.
4. Activation functions: These determine the output of a neural network. Common activation functions include the rectified linear unit (ReLU), sigmoid, and hyperbolic tangent (tanh).
5. Regularization techniques: These help prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. Examples include L1 and L2 regularization.
6. Batch size: This is the number of training examples used in one iteration of the optimization process.
7. Number of epochs: This is the total number of times the learning algorithm will work through the entire training dataset.

These hyperparameters need to be carefully chosen to ensure the best performance of the deep learning model. Techniques for hyperparameter tuning include grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization.
