The provided context discusses various aspects of water quality monitoring and prediction using deep learning techniques, but it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some data preprocessing techniques that are often used in machine learning and deep learning, such as data collection and feature extraction.

Data bias can occur when the training data is not representative of the entire population, leading to poor generalization of the model. To address data bias, various techniques can be used during the preprocessing phase of the deep learning pipeline. These techniques include:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the data into subgroups based on certain criteria, such as class labels, and then randomly sampling from each subgroup to ensure that each group is represented in the training, validation, and testing sets.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of samples from the minority class to balance the class distribution in the training data.
3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of samples from the majority class to balance the class distribution in the training data.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from various sources and ensuring that the data is diverse and representative of the entire population.

The context mentions the use of a CNN-LSTM combined deep learning approach for predicting water level and water quality (Baek et al., 2020). In this study, the authors used a dataset consisting of water level and water quality measurements collected from a water quality monitoring station. However, they do not mention any techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing phase.

In another study, Cao et al. (2022) used a deep learning method for predicting cyanobacterial harmful algae blooms in Taihu Lake, China. They used a dataset consisting of water quality measurements collected from multiple sources. However, they do not mention any techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing phase.

Therefore, while the context provides valuable information on deep learning techniques for water quality monitoring and prediction, it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing phase. However, the techniques mentioned above are commonly used in machine learning and deep learning to address data bias.
