Deep learning models often deal with large datasets, and handling randomness in the pipeline is crucial to ensure the reproducibility and reliability of the results. One way to manage randomness is by setting a random seed value. However, the provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of random seed values.

In general, setting a random seed value is a common practice in machine learning and deep learning to ensure consistent and reproducible results. By setting a specific seed value, the random number generator used in various processes, like data shuffling, weight initialization, or dropout regularization, will produce the same sequence of random numbers. This ensures that the same initial conditions are maintained across multiple runs or experiments, leading to consistent outcomes.

For instance, in the context of the yellow-billed oxpeckers roosting on their large mammalian hosts, the researchers might have used a random seed value when splitting their dataset into training and test sets. This would ensure that the same images are consistently assigned to the training or test sets, allowing for a fair evaluation of the model's performance.

Similarly, in the context of Table 1, which compares the performance of different deep learning architectures, the authors might have used a fixed random seed value during their experiments. This would guarantee that the comparison of the architectures is based on consistent and reproducible results.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, setting a random seed value is a common practice in deep learning to ensure consistent and reproducible results. This can be applied in various stages of the deep learning pipeline, such as data splitting, weight initialization, and dropout regularization.
