Based on the provided context, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used in the pipeline for semantic segmentation tasks. Specifically, the deep learning models mentioned include Deeplabv3+ with COCO classes and fully connected Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). These models are used for pixel-wise classification and object delineation in images.

In the study by Taghanaki et al. (2021), deep learning-based semantic segmentation methods, such as Deeplabv3+, were used for locating and delineating artificial and natural objects in photos. Similarly, in the study by Martinez-Sanchez et al. (2022), semantic image segmentation with deep convolutional nets, atrous convolution, and fully connected CRFs was employed for detailed skyline extraction and classification of objects below the sky.
