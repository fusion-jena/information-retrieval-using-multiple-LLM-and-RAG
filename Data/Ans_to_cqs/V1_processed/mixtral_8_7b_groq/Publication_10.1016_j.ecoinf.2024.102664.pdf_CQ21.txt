Based on the information provided, there are no specific details about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to calculate various metrics for evaluating the performance of models after training. Some of these metrics include confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for classification problems. For regression problems like the one suggested by the RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) values in the table, metrics such as RMSE, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared can be used for evaluation.

In the context of the table provided, the RMSE values are given for different models (CNN, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM) using various solvers (Adam, SGDM, and RMSProp) and input time series lengths (3 days and 7 days) on validation data. The RMSE values can be used to compare the performance of these models, with lower RMSE indicating better performance.

As for techniques like saliency maps, they are typically used during the model training phase for interpretability and understanding the decision-making process of the model. Saliency maps highlight the important features in the input data that contribute to the model's output. However, they can also be used in the postprocessing stage to interpret and validate the model's predictions.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention any postprocessing steps, it is common practice to calculate various metrics for evaluating the model's performance after training. Additionally, techniques like saliency maps can be used during or after the training phase for interpretability and validation purposes.
