Based on the information provided, the specific type of deep learning model used in the study "Analysis of input set characteristics and variances on k-fold cross validation for a recurrent neural network model on waste disposal rate estimation" by Vu, Ng, Richter, An is a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). This is evident from the title and the paper's content, where they discuss the performance of the RNN model in estimating waste disposal rates. However, the exact architecture of the RNN model (such as Long Short-Term Memory or Gated Recurrent Units) is not specified in the context.
