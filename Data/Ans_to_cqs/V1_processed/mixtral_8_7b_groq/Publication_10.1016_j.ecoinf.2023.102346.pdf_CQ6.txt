The provided context discusses the use of machine learning algorithms, including some that can be considered deep learning, for various applications such as species distribution modeling and microbiome-based classification problems. However, it does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.

Nevertheless, based on general practices in deep learning and machine learning, some common preprocessing steps can be inferred. These steps include:

1. Data cleaning: This involves removing or correcting erroneous or missing data points. In the context of machine learning, this step is crucial to ensure that the model is trained on high-quality data.
2. Data normalization or scaling: This step involves transforming the data to a common scale, often between 0 and 1, to prevent any feature from having a disproportionate influence on the model due to its scale. This is particularly important in deep learning models, which often have many parameters and can easily overfit to features with large scales.
3. Feature engineering: This step involves creating new features from the existing data that might be more informative or relevant for the model. This can include techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) or other dimensionality reduction techniques.
4. Data splitting: This step involves dividing the data into training, validation, and testing sets. This is important to ensure that the model can generalize well to new, unseen data.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, it is common practice to perform data cleaning, normalization or scaling, feature engineering, and data splitting before training a deep learning model.
