In the context of machine learning and deep learning pipelines, regularization methods are often employed to prevent overfitting and improve model generalization. However, the provided context focuses primarily on traditional machine learning algorithms and models, with limited information on deep learning-specific techniques.

From the context, we can identify some regularization methods used in traditional machine learning models, even though they are not explicitly mentioned as deep learning regularization techniques. These methods include:

1. **Alpha or L1 regularization**: This method adds a penalty term to the loss function, which is the sum of the absolute values of the model's coefficients, multiplied by a regularization parameter (alpha). This encourages sparse models, where some coefficients become zero, helping to reduce overfitting.

2. **L2 regularization**: Similar to alpha regularization, L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, which is the sum of the squares of the model's coefficients, multiplied by a regularization parameter. This results in smaller coefficient values, reducing overfitting without making coefficients zero.

3. **Limiting the complexity of the model**: Techniques such as setting the maximum depth of decision trees, limiting the number of features considered for splitting, or restricting the number of estimators in ensemble models can help prevent overfitting by reducing the model's complexity.

However, the query specifically asks about regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline. Deep learning pipelines typically use different regularization techniques, such as:

1. **Dropout**: This technique randomly sets a fraction of the output of a layer to zero during training, which helps prevent overfitting by making the network more robust and less dependent on specific neuron connections.

2. **Weight decay (L2 regularization for neural networks)**: Similar to L2 regularization in traditional machine learning, weight decay adds a penalty term to the loss function, which is the sum of the squares of the model's weights, multiplied by a regularization parameter. This encourages smaller weight values, reducing overfitting.

3. **Batch normalization**: This technique normalizes the inputs of each layer, which can help prevent overfitting by reducing internal covariate shift and allowing for higher learning rates.

4. **Early stopping**: This method stops training when the performance on a validation set stops improving, preventing the model from further overfitting to the training data.

Based on the provided context, we can only partially answer the query, mentioning some regularization methods used in traditional machine learning. To fully address the query, additional context on deep learning-specific regularization techniques is required.
