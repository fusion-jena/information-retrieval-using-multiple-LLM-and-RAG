Based on the provided context, there is no information that directly answers the query about which frameworks were used to build a deep learning model. The text describes the development of an equitable nutrient reduction decision support tool, which includes various best management practices (BMPs) for reducing water pollution. However, it does not mention any deep learning models or the frameworks used to build them.

The text does mention that the geodatabase used in the study is available as a map package for download and customization. It is possible that the researchers used a deep learning framework to develop a model that is part of this geodatabase. However, without further information, it is not possible to determine which frameworks were used.

In summary, while the text describes the development of a decision support tool for water pollution reduction, it does not provide information on the use of deep learning models or the frameworks used to build them. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
