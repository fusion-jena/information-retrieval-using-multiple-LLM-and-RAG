The text provided does not give specific details about the steps taken to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. However, it does describe the process of training the model using the Inception v.3 architecture and two optimization techniques: transfer learning and data augmentation. The training datasets were constructed using very high resolution satellite and aerial RGB images from two sources. The training phase involved training five CNN models using these datasets. In the classification phase, new images with different tree cover in global drylands were classified using the built CNN-based model. Finally, in the validation phase, the performance of the model on the new images was assessed.
