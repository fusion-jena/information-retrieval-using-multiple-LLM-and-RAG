Based on the information provided, there is no explicit mention of the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context focuses on the data used, the methods for training and validating the model, and the features that the model found most relevant for its predictions.

However, it is common practice to use Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) for training deep learning models due to their ability to perform many calculations simultaneously, which is beneficial for the parallel processing required in deep learning. Therefore, it is possible that GPUs were used for training the model in this case, but this information is not confirmed by the context provided.
