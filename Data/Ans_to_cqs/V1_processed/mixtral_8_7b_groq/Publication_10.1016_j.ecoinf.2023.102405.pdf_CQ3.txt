The provided context does not include specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for water contamination classification in aquaculture. However, it does mention some key steps in the overall deep learning process.

The pipeline includes updating the hidden state, calculating attention scores, computing the weighted attention, predicting labels for the current mini-batch, calculating the loss between predicted and true labels, backpropagating gradients, updating model parameters using an optimizer, and tracking total loss and total correct predictions.

While these steps are crucial for training and implementing deep learning models, the context does not mention any specific data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. These techniques are often used in computer vision tasks to prepare and label the data before training deep learning models.

In summary, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query regarding data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for water contamination classification in aquaculture.
