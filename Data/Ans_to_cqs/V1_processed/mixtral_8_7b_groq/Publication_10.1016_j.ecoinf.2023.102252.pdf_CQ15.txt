Based on the provided context, there is no information about the specific deep learning pipeline used or the optimization techniques applied, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. The context focuses on the FERM (Forecasting Environmental Resource Management) model, which is an ecological target forecasting model. It discusses the parameters and formulas used in the FERM model, but it does not mention any deep learning pipeline or optimization techniques.

The FERM model is a rule-based model that uses a set of parameters and formulas to forecast the ecological condition of a target based on weather data. It includes parameters for the maximum increase in condition score, worst condition, best condition, drowning switch, drowned threshold, critical interval, and distance weighting. The model calculates the dry spell duration (D2) based on whether the target is on a recovery or declining trajectory.

However, the context does not provide information on how the FERM model is implemented or optimized. It does not mention any deep learning techniques or optimization algorithms, such as SGD or Adam. Therefore, it is not possible to answer this query without additional information.
