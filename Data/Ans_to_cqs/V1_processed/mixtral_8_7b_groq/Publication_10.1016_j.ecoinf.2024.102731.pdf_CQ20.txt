The provided context does not include information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The text focuses on the use of remote sensing data and land cover classification for locating urban heat-prone areas and determining the health benefits of ecosystems.

However, it is common practice to use Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) for training deep learning models due to their ability to perform parallel processing, which significantly speeds up the training process compared to using Central Processing Units (CPUs) alone. Google's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) are another hardware resource that can be used for training deep learning models, particularly for large-scale machine learning tasks.

Therefore, while the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model in this context are not mentioned, it is likely that GPUs were used, and possibly TPUs as well.
