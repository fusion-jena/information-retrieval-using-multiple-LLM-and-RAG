Based on the provided context, the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned. However, it is stated that occurrence records of selected denitrifiers were downloaded using the "rgbif" package, which is an interface to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) API. Therefore, it can be inferred that the data may have been sourced from GBIF. As for the deep learning pipeline, there is no information provided about where its code or data might be deposited. Researchers often use platforms like GitHub, Zenodo, Figshare, or Dryad to share their code and data, but without further information, it is not possible to provide a specific repository for this particular study.
