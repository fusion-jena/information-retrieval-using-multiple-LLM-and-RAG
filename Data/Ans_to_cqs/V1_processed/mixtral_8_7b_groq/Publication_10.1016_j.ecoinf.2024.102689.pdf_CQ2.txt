Deep learning techniques can be applied to various data formats, including images, audio, video, and structured data such as CSV files.

In the contexts provided, there are examples of deep learning being used with image, audio, and video data.

For image data, there are several examples of deep learning being used for image classification tasks. For instance, Lahiri et al. (2011) used images to identify individual zebras in the wild, while Lei et al. (2022) developed an underwater target detection algorithm based on improved YOLOv5. Additionally, Lu et al. (2020) identified the species of harvested tuna and billfish using deep convolutional neural networks.

Deep learning has also been applied to audio data, as demonstrated by Laplante et al. (2021) who used deep learning and audio data for fish recognition in underwater environments. Similarly, Song (2020) used multiple features for English speech recognition based on deep learning.

In the context of video data, Spampinato et al. (2008) detected, tracked, and counted fish in low quality unconstrained underwater videos using computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms. Additionally, Tseng and Kuo (2020) detected and counted harvested fish and identified fish types in electronic monitoring system videos using deep convolutional neural networks.

Finally, while not explicitly mentioned in the provided contexts, deep learning can also be applied to structured data such as CSV files. For example, Singh et al. (2017) used deep learning for machine translation, which typically involves processing large amounts of text data.

In summary, deep learning can be applied to various data formats, including image, audio, video, and structured data such as CSV files. The provided contexts demonstrate the use of deep learning with image, audio, and video data.
