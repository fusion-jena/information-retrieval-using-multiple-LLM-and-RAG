The provided context does not specifically mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss various methods used to improve the accuracy and applicability of land use and land cover (LULC) classification.

In the context, Zhang et al. (2020) introduced a hexagonal random-sampling strategy along with a tile model to improve the accuracy of LULC mapping in Madagascar. This strategy aims to mitigate the limitations of the overall model and tackle the problem of unbalanced training data in RF-based LULC mapping.

Another approach mentioned in the context is image presegmentation, which retains the benefits of object-based classification while eliminating time-consuming parameter adjustments required by traditional segmentation methods. This method is deployed on the GEE platform, making it easily applicable to other regions or different study years.

As for the query on data augmentation techniques in deep learning pipelines, common methods include flipping, rotating, and scaling. Flipping refers to horizontally or vertically flipping the image, which helps the model learn rotational invariance. Rotating involves rotating the image by a certain angle, which increases the dataset size and helps the model generalize better. Scaling changes the size of the image, allowing the model to learn features at different scales. These techniques help improve the model's performance by increasing the diversity of the training data.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention data augmentation techniques in deep learning pipelines, it discusses other methods used to improve LULC classification accuracy and applicability. Common data augmentation techniques in deep learning include flipping, rotating, and scaling.
