The provided context does not include information about specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet that are commonly used in deep learning pipelines. However, it does mention the use of landscape photographs and oblique photogrammetry in the context of using convolutional neural networks for landscape analysis.

In the study by Puschmann (2019), repeat landscape photographs were used as input to a convolutional neural network for the automatic recognition of woody regrowth vegetation. This approach allows for the identification of general trends of landscape change over time.

In the study by Guo et al. (2023), oblique photogrammetry was used to construct 3D landscape indexes for islands. While the specific dataset used in this study is not mentioned, it is likely that the authors used a dataset of oblique images of the islands as input to their 3D reconstruction pipeline.

Therefore, while the provided context does not directly answer the query about specific datasets used in deep learning pipelines, it does suggest that landscape photographs and oblique photogrammetry can be used as input to deep learning models for landscape analysis.
