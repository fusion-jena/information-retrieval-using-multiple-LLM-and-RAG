Based on the provided context, there is no information about deploying a deep learning model. The context mainly discusses the classification of input dataset combinations using Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) classifiers, with two sets of classes (7C and 13C). The classifications and hyperparameter tuning were conducted in R 4.2 with the caret package.

The context also discusses accuracy assessment strategies, such as training data augmentation, segmentation, filtering, handling the geometry of training data, and adjusting the proportion of training and test data. However, these are general strategies for improving classification accuracy and do not pertain to deploying a deep learning model.

Therefore,


The provided context does not contain information on the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection.
