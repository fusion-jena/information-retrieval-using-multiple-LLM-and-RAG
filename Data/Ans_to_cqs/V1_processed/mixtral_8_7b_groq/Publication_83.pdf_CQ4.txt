Based on the provided context, there are no specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling mentioned in the described deep learning pipeline. Instead, the text discusses two methods for handling multi-variate varying length audio data: repeating signals and resizing audio images to a fixed size.

The first method, repeating signals, is used to ensure a fixed duration of 2 seconds for audio files in the CLO-43DS data. This method achieves higher accuracy (91.2%) than resizing spectrograms (88.5%). The second method, resizing audio images, leads to the loss of some acoustic patterns, which might be the reason for its lower performance.

The deep learning architecture used in the feature learning part of the proposed model follows a VGG style network, which has been previously used for classifying acoustic scenes. The network is trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 10âˆ’4, and the categorical cross entropy is utilized as the loss function.

In addition, the work of [30] uses a triplet sampling method for generating triplet spectrograms as input to CNNs: full spectrogram, harmonic-component based spectrogram, and percussive-component spectrogram. A dynamic triplet loss is then used for classification using a multi-scale analysis module.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention common data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling, it does discuss two methods for handling varying length audio data and a triplet sampling method for generating triplet spectrograms.
