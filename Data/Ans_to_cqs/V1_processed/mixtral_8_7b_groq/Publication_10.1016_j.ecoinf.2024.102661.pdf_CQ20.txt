The context provided does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It mentions the TPEBO-LSTM neural network and the GRU model, but it does not specify whether they were trained on CPUs, GPUs, TPUs, or other types of hardware. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
