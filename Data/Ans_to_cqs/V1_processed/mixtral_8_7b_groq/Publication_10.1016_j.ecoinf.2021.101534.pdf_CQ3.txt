The provided context does not contain specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for audio data. However, it does mention the use of spectrograms as input images for model training. In the context of image data, common data annotation techniques include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing a rectangle around the object of interest in an image. It is often used for object detection tasks, where the goal is to locate and classify objects within an image.
2. Instance segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image to indicate which object it belongs to. It is a more fine-grained approach than bounding box annotation, as it provides a precise outline of each object.

In the context of audio data, these techniques may be adapted to label specific frequencies or time intervals of interest. For example, in the study by Zhang et al. (2019), spectrogram-frame linear networks and continuous frame sequences were used for bird sound classification. This likely involved some form of data annotation to label specific bird sounds within the audio data. Similarly, in the study by Garamszegi (2019), an open-source deep-learning object detection method was used for bird song and syllable segmentation. This also likely involved data annotation to label specific bird sounds or syllables within the audio data.

It is worth noting that the provided context mentions data augmentation as a technique to overcome the problem of limited data and improve model performance. While data augmentation is not a data annotation technique per se, it can be used in conjunction with data annotation to increase the variability of the training dataset. For example, in the context of audio data, data augmentation techniques such as changing the frequency, pitch, and volume of audio signals, shifting, rotating and zooming in the time and/or frequency domains of spectrograms, and adding additional noise can be applied to the annotated data to create a more diverse training dataset.

In summary, while the provided context does not contain specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for audio data, it is likely that some form of data annotation is used to label specific frequencies or time intervals of interest. Additionally, data augmentation techniques can be used in conjunction with data annotation to increase the variability of the training dataset.
