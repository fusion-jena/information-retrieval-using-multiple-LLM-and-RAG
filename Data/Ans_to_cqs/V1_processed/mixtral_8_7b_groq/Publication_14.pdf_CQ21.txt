Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps applied after the model training process. However, it does mention that the model's performance is evaluated on a test dataset, which includes the calculation of the average frame rate.

The test dataset evaluation includes feature extraction of fixed inception layers, which takes approximately 1 hour and 26 minutes on 15 CPUs. Following this, the training of new layers is carried out, which takes around 27 minutes on a single CPU. The model's performance is then evaluated on 70 test videos, which contain a majority of hummingbird visitation events.

For each frame, the neural network returns a probability of background or foreground. Using a standard acceptance threshold of 0.5 to classify background, the model had a true positive rate of 89.3% and a true negative rate of 91.9%. By applying a more conservative 0.1 acceptance threshold, the model had a 95.7% true positive rate and a 76.1% true negative rate.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrix calculation, it does describe the evaluation of the model's performance on a test dataset, including the calculation of true positive and true negative rates.
