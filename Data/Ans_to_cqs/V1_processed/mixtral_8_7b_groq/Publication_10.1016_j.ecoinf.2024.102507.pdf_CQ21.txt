Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, it does mention that the "correct rate" is calculated through model evaluation (Step 5). This implies that some form of Metrics calculation is being performed, but it is not clear which specific metrics are being used.

The context does provide detailed information about the data preparation, model building, compilation, training, and testing process. The data preparation involves preparing eight categories of ground truth images and extracting training samples. The model building uses Keras to build mathematical functions in TensorFlow. The model compilation sets the shortest path in deep learning through code compilation. The training involves fitting the data and the model, and automatically adjusting deep learning parameters according to the set number of epochs. The testing calculates the correct rate through model evaluation.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention Saliency maps or Confusion matrix, it does mention Metrics calculation. However, the specific metrics used are not provided. It is possible that additional postprocessing steps are being performed, but the context does not provide enough information to determine this.


In conclusion, based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include Metrics calculation, but it is not clear which specific metrics are being used. The context does not explicitly mention Saliency maps or Confusion matrix. The provided information mainly focuses on the data preparation, model building, compilation, training, and testing process.
