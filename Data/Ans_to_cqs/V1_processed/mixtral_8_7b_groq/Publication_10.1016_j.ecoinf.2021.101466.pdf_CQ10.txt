I am unable to provide a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the query. The context provided includes several research papers and materials that use deep learning for various applications such as entomology, fine-grained image classification, and small object detection. However, none of the provided materials contain a direct link to a code repository.

The first paper by Tan and Le (2019) proposes a method for scaling convolutional neural networks using a compound scaling method, but it does not provide a code repository link. Similarly, the second paper by Tresson et al. (2021) presents a hierarchical classification approach for detecting arthropod species, but it does not provide a code repository link either.

The third paper by Tresson et al. (2019) introduces CORIGAN, a method for assessing multiple species and interactions within images, but it does not provide a code repository link. The fourth paper by Valan et al. (2019) presents a method for automated taxonomic identification of insects using effective feature transfer from convolutional networks, but again, it does not provide a code repository link.

Finally, the fifth paper by Van Etten (2018) proposes a rapid multi-scale object detection method for satellite imagery, but it does not provide a code repository link.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the query. However, the research papers provided can be used as a starting point for developing a deep learning pipeline for the desired application.
