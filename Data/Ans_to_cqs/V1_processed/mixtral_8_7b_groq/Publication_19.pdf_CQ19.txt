The deep learning models were built using the Keras framework, which is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. In this particular study, the Keras framework was used to build the models on top of TensorFlow. This is evident in the conversion of the best-trained Inception-V3 model to TensorFlow Lite, which is a lightweight version of TensorFlow, designed to run on mobile and embedded devices.

In summary, the Keras framework was used to build the deep learning models, and the TensorFlow framework was used for the conversion of the models to TensorFlow Lite.
