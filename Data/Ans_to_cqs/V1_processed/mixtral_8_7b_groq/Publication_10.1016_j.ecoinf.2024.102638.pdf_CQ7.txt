The provided context discusses the data splitting process for machine learning models but does not mention specific criteria for splitting data in deep learning models. However, it does explain the general approach to splitting data for model training and validation.


The data splitting process for machine learning models involves dividing the dataset into training sets and a test set. The training sets comprise 80% of the data, and the test set represents the remaining 20%. This division is done by random sampling to ensure that both subsets are representative of the overall dataset and minimize the risk of bias. Randomization helps preserve the distribution of key features and target variables across both training and test sets, enhancing the generalizability of the model.

In the context provided, the scikit-learn function GridSearchCV is used for hyperparameter optimization, and a five-fold cross-validation is applied during this process. Cross-validation is a technique used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model by dividing the training set into k subsets or folds. The model is then trained on k-1 folds while one fold is held back as a validation set. This process is repeated k times, with a different fold used as the validation set each time. The average performance across all k folds is then used as the overall performance measure.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used for splitting data in deep learning models, cross-validation is also commonly used in deep learning for hyperparameter tuning and model validation. In deep learning, the data is typically split into training, validation, and test sets. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and select the best model, and the test set is used to evaluate the final model performance.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly answer the query, it can be inferred that the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are similar to those used for machine learning models, involving random sampling and cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning and model validation.
