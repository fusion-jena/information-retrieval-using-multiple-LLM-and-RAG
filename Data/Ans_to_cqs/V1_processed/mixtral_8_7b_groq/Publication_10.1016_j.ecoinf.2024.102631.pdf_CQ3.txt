The provided context does not include specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the network takes images with dimensions of 256 Ã— 256 pixels and three color channels as input. This suggests that some form of image annotation was used to prepare the dataset for training the network.

In general, there are several data annotation techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines for computer vision tasks. Here are some of them:

1. Image classification: In this technique, images are annotated with a single label that represents the dominant object or scene in the image. For example, an image of a dog might be labeled as "dog," while an image of a sunset might be labeled as "sunset."
2. Object detection: In object detection, images are annotated with bounding boxes that identify the location and extent of objects within the image. Each bounding box is typically associated with a label that identifies the object. For example, an image of a dog playing in a park might be annotated with bounding boxes around the dog and the park, with labels "dog" and "park" respectively.
3. Semantic segmentation: In semantic segmentation, images are annotated at the pixel level, with each pixel assigned a label that represents the object or material it belongs to. For example, an image of a street scene might be annotated with labels for "road," "sidewalk," "building," "car," and so on.
4. Instance segmentation: Instance segmentation is a more fine-grained version of semantic segmentation, where each instance of an object is identified and segmented separately. For example, an image of a group of people might be annotated with instance segmentation masks that identify each person individually.

The choice of data annotation technique depends on the specific task and the desired output. For example, image classification might be sufficient for a simple task like identifying the presence or absence of a particular object in an image. However, more complex tasks like object detection or segmentation might require more sophisticated annotation techniques.

In the context of the provided text, it is possible that the images were annotated using one or more of these techniques, but the specific method is not mentioned.
