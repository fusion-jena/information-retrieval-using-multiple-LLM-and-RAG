Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context includes details about the Godavari River Basin, India water quality prediction study using machine learning models and grid search method. It also mentions the use of the Python library's randint and uniform commands for hyperparameter selection. However, it does not provide any information about the data repository.

The study papers referenced in the context are:

* "Water quality prediction using machine learning models based on grid search method" published in Multimed. Tools Appl. in 2023.
* "Free and open source geographic information tools for landscape ecology" published in Eco. Inform. in 2009.
* "A review of surface water quality models" published in Sci. World J. in 2013.
* "On hyperparameter optimization of machine learning algorithms: theory and practice" published in Neurocomputing in 2020.

None of these papers mention the data repository for the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to the query.
