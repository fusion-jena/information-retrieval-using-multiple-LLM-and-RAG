The data formats used in the deep learning pipeline described in the context are Sentinel-1 images and text files in the darknet annotation format.

The Sentinel-1 images are synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images that provide information about the ocean surface, including objects such as icebergs and ships. These images are used as input to the deep learning model for the purpose of detecting and classifying ocean objects.

The text files in the darknet annotation format contain information on the label class of objects and their positions in the image. These files are used to train the deep learning model by providing it with labeled data that it can learn from.

In addition to these data formats, it is also mentioned that the Sentinel-1 images are cropped into image tiles in the sizes of 640 Ã— 640 pixels. This preprocessing step is likely done to make the images more manageable for the deep learning model and to increase the amount of training data available.

It is important to note that the data format used in a deep learning pipeline can vary depending on the specific application and the type of data being used. In this case, the data format consists of SAR images and labeled text files, but other common data formats include images, audio, video, and CSV files.
