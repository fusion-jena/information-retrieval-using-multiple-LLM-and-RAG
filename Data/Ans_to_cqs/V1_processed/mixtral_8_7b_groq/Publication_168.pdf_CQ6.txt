In the context provided, there is no explicit mention of specific preprocessing steps taken before training a deep learning model for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. However, it is mentioned that the training samples are used to learn the weights and biases of the network, and the test samples are used to evaluate the classification performance. This implies that some form of preprocessing was done to prepare the data for training.

In the field of deep learning, particularly for image classification tasks, some common preprocessing steps include:

1. Normalization: This is the process of re-scaling the pixel values of the image to a range of [0,1] or [-1,1] to improve the training stability and speed of the deep learning model.
2. Scaling: This is similar to normalization, but it involves scaling the pixel values to a specific range or standard deviation.
3. Cleaning: This involves removing noise or unwanted features from the image, such as removing dead pixels or correcting for atmospheric effects.

For HSI classification, additional preprocessing steps may include:

1. Dimensionality reduction: HSI data can have a large number of bands, which can lead to the curse of dimensionality. Dimensionality reduction techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA), can be used to reduce the number of bands while preserving the relevant information.
2. Feature extraction: This involves extracting meaningful features from the HSI data, such as spectral or spatial features, which can be used as input to the deep learning model.
3. Data augmentation: This involves creating new training samples by applying transformations, such as rotation or flipping, to the existing samples. This can help improve the generalization performance of the deep learning model.

In summary, while the context provided does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps taken before training a deep learning model for HSI classification, it is implied that some form of preprocessing was done. Common preprocessing steps for deep learning image classification tasks include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. For HSI classification, additional preprocessing steps may include dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, and data augmentation.
