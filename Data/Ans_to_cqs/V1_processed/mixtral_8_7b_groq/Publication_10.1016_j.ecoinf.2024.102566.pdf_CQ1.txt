The methods used for collecting raw data in the context of deep learning models for biomass estimation mainly involve field surveys and remote sensing techniques.

In the study by Morais et al. (2024), the authors used field-collected data for biomass estimation. However, due to the insufficiency of high-quality training samples, they integrated forest inventory data with remote sensing imagery for biomass estimation. This approach suggests the use of both field surveys and remote sensing techniques for data collection.

Bortolot and Wynne (2005) used small footprint LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data for estimating forest biomass. LiDAR is a remote sensing technology that uses laser light to measure distances to the Earth and create highly accurate 3D models of the landscape. This technology is often used for forest inventory and biomass estimation.

Bai and Zang (2007) conducted a phytocoenological study of Abies fargesii forests in the Qinlin Mountains, which likely involved field surveys and data collection.

Bonan (2008) discussed the role of forests in climate change, which would require data on forest biomass and carbon sequestration. While the study does not explicitly mention data collection methods, remote sensing and field surveys are commonly used for such data collection.

Brdaford et al. (2008) studied tree age, disturbance history, and carbon stocks and fluxes in subalpine Rocky Mountain forests. The study likely involved field surveys and data collection.

Chen (2007) researched the forest biomass and carbon storage in Xiaolong, but the data collection methods are not specified.

Lu (2006) discussed the potential and challenge of remote sensing-based biomass estimation, indicating the use of remote sensing techniques for data collection.

Deng et al. (2016) used a combination of field inventory data and remote sensing data for estimating forest biomass.

Li et al. (2012) compared the estimation of wood biomass using forest inventory data, indicating the use of field surveys for data collection.

Liang et al. (2012) discussed advanced remote sensing techniques for terrestrial information extraction and applications, indicating the use of remote sensing techniques for data collection.

Liu et al. (2012a) estimated the spatial distribution of forest biomass in China based on remote sensing and downscaling techniques, indicating the use of remote sensing techniques for data collection.

In summary, the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for biomass estimation mainly involve field surveys and remote sensing techniques such as LiDAR and satellite imagery.
