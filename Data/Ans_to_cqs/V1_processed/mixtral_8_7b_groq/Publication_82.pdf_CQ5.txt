The deep learning pipeline in the study referred to uses three different types of datasets: Color, Gray scale, and Leaf Segmented. These datasets are used for training and testing the deep learning models with various configurations. However, the specific names or sources of these datasets are not provided in the context.

The Color dataset consists of images in their original color format, while the Gray scale dataset contains grayscale versions of the same images. The Leaf Segmented dataset is a specialized dataset that contains segmented images of leaves. These datasets are used in combination with two deep learning architectures (AlexNet and GoogLeNet), two training mechanisms (Transfer Learning and Training from Scratch), and five different train-test set distributions (Train: 80%, Test: 20%, Train: 60%, Test: 40%, Train: 50%, Test: 50%, Train: 40%, Test: 60%, and Train: 20%, Test: 80%).

The models are trained using specific hyperparameters, such as learning rate, momentum, weight decay, gamma, and batch size. The training process involves using the softMax layer to produce a distribution of values across the 38 classes, which can be interpreted as the confidences of the network that a given input image is represented by the corresponding classes.

While the specific names of the datasets used in this study are not provided, the study demonstrates the use of custom datasets in deep learning pipelines. This is an essential aspect of deep learning research, as researchers often need to create and use their own datasets to address specific problems or research questions.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline in the study referred to uses three types of datasets: Color, Gray scale, and Leaf Segmented. These datasets are used in combination with two deep learning architectures, two training mechanisms, and five different train-test set distributions. The specific names or sources of these datasets are not provided in the context.
