The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics are calculated for each class and are scored between 0 and 1, with optimal performance reached at 1.

Accuracy is the proportion of images that the model classifies correctly. Recall, also known as sensitivity, refers to the proportion of images of each class that were correctly classified. Precision, on the other hand, determines the accuracy of the predictions themselves; it measures the proportion of images that were assigned a correct class when classified. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall and provides a single metric that encapsulates both.

In addition to these metrics, a class-averaged F1 score is also reported, which provides an overall measure of performance across all classes. The performance of the model is evaluated using a test dataset, and the results are presented in Table 6, which shows the classifier testing performance with overall test accuracy and class-averaged metrics (Recall, Precision and F1 Score).

The deep learning model used in the study is a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with linear and radial basis function (RBF) kernels and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The performance of these models is evaluated during training and testing, and the results are presented in Tables 5 and 6. During training, the models are evaluated using mean cross-validation (CV) accuracy, and the final training accuracy is reported.

In summary, the performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics are calculated for each class and are used to provide an overall measure of performance across all classes. The models used in the study include SVM with linear and RBF kernels and a CNN, and their performance is evaluated during training and testing using mean cross-validation accuracy and final training accuracy.
