The provided context does not give information about the optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. The context mainly discusses the estimation of aboveground biomass (AGB) in different forest ecosystems using various data sources and methods.

The studies by Georgopoulos et al. (2023), Ghosh and Behera (2018), Ghosh et al. (2021), and Brahma et al. (2021) focus on estimating AGB in different forest types using remote sensing data and various algorithms. Giri et al. (2019) review forest biomass estimation equations in India. The data sources include airborne LiDAR, multi-sensor data, and GEDI (Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation) L4A footprint data.

The study by Georgopoulos et al. (2023) uses a flow chart (Fig. 3) to depict their methods, which include filtering GEDI data based on a beam sensitivity threshold of 0.98 to minimize measurement error in the RH metrics. However, there is no mention of optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query about the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
