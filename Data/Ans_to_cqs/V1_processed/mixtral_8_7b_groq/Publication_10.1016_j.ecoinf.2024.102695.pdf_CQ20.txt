The deep learning model is trained using specific hardware resources, including a laptop with a 12th-Gen Intel Core i7-12700H GPU and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 GPU. These two GPUs are likely to handle the majority of the computational workload during the training process. GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) technology is particularly well-suited for deep learning tasks due to its ability to perform parallel computations efficiently, which is essential for handling the large matrix and vector operations involved in training neural networks. The use of these GPUs allows for faster training times and more efficient resource utilization compared to relying solely on the laptop's primary CPU.
