The data repository of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the database is a PostgreSQL database with PostGIS and Timescale extensions for handling geospatial data and time-series data, respectively. There are also references to code repositories on Code Ocean and GitHub, but these do not appear to be the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific location for the data repository without additional information.
