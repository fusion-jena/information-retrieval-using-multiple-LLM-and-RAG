The provided context discusses the use of Sentinel-2 satellite data and various data processing techniques, but it does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide some general techniques that are commonly used to address data bias in machine learning and deep learning.

1. Stratified sampling: During the data splitting process, it is important to maintain the same proportion of classes in both the training and testing sets. Stratified sampling ensures that each subset (training or testing) contains a representative proportion of samples from each class.

2. Oversampling: In cases where one class has significantly fewer samples than the other, oversampling can be used to balance the classes. This technique involves creating synthetic samples of the minority class, either by duplicating existing samples or using more advanced methods like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).

3. Undersampling: Alternatively, undersampling can be used to balance the classes by reducing the number of samples from the majority class. However, this technique may result in loss of valuable information.

4. Diverse data collection: Collecting data from various sources, locations, and conditions can help ensure that the dataset is diverse and representative of the real-world scenarios. This can help reduce the risk of bias and improve the model's generalization ability.

5. Data augmentation: This technique involves creating new samples by applying transformations (e.g., rotation, scaling, flipping) to the existing dataset. Data augmentation can help increase the size of the dataset and reduce overfitting, while also providing the model with more diverse data.

6. Preprocessing: Applying consistent preprocessing techniques to the entire dataset can help ensure that the data is unbiased. For example, using the same atmospheric correction method for all images in a satellite dataset can help ensure that the data is consistent and unbiased.

While the provided context does not directly mention these techniques, it is essential to consider these methods when addressing data bias during preprocessing in a deep learning pipeline.
