The provided context does not include information about a deep learning model or the use of metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall to evaluate its performance. However, it does include the use of several metrics to evaluate the performance of models used for analyzing acoustic data in a study of marine organisms.

The metrics used in the study are Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of models both on the training data and on a separate test data set. The RMSE and MAE values are given for various models, including those that incorporate spatial covariates and those that do not.

The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is a measure of the difference between the values predicted by a model and the actual values. It is calculated as the square root of the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values. A lower RMSE indicates a better fit of the model to the data.

The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is another measure of the difference between the predicted and actual values. It is calculated as the average of the absolute differences between the predicted and actual values. Like the RMSE, a lower MAE indicates a better fit of the model to the data.

In addition to the RMSE and MAE, the study also reports the R-squared (R2) values for some of the models. The R2 is a measure of the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. It is calculated as the ratio of the sum of the squared residuals of the model to the total sum of squares of the dependent variable. An R2 value close to 1 indicates a good fit of the model to the data.

In summary, the provided context includes the use of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to evaluate the performance of models used for analyzing acoustic data in a study of marine organisms. The RMSE and MAE are measures of the difference between the predicted and actual values, with lower values indicating a better fit of the model to the data. The study also reports R-squared (R2) values for some of the models, which is a measure of the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
