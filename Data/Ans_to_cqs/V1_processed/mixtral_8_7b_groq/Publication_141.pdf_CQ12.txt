The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the context provided, which mentions the use of a CNN model for image classification. Specifically, the CNN model consists of a convolutional part for feature extraction and a fully connected layer for classification. The model is trained using a two-stage process, where the top classifier is trained in the first stage and the network is fine-tuned in the second stage. Data augmentation and dropout techniques are also applied to enhance model robustness. The implementation of the CNN classifier is done using the Keras library with TensorFlow as the back-end engine. The regions of the images that are most informative for the decision making process in the deep learning model are visualized using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), which generates heatmaps indicating important aspects of the input images used for taxonomic decision-making.
