Based on the provided context, the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model can be summarized as follows:

First, the model parameters were modified from the default configuration to balance the use of resources and training speed. The resolution was retained at 704 Ã— 704, batch size at 64, 32 subdivisions, and trained up to 6000 iterations. Other parameters were kept to their default settings or set according to the guidance provided by the developers.

Next, manual annotations were used to generate training, validation, and testing datasets. The annotations included the label name, center x, and center y coordinates.

After training the model, it took approximately 18 hours to complete the 6000 iterations. Measuring the accuracy of the different CNNs and the effect of different confidence thresholds took several hours but could be further automated. Predictions on the 58,148 images took approximately 10 hours.

The training and prediction phases did not require constant supervision and could be performed overnight or while the analyst was free to attend to other tasks. The duration of these phases may vary between users, depending on the hardware used.

However, the context does not provide information on the specific steps taken for model serialization or platform selection. Model serialization is the process of saving the trained model in a format that can be easily loaded and used for making predictions. Platform selection refers to choosing the hardware or software platform where the model will be deployed.

Therefore, while we can infer the general process followed for training and deploying the model, the specific steps taken for model serialization and platform selection are not provided in the context.


The model parameters were modified, and manual annotations were used to generate training, validation, and testing datasets. The model was trained for 6000 iterations, and the accuracy was measured. Predictions on the images took approximately 10 hours. However, the context does not provide information on model serialization or platform selection.
