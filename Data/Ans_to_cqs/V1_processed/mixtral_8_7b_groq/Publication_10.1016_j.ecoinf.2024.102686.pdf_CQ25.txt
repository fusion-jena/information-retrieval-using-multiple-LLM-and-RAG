The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific purpose of the deep learning model, such as classification, segmentation, or detection. However, it does discuss the use of Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) networks for clustering and large-scale partitioning.

SOM networks are a type of artificial neural network that is trained using unsupervised learning. They are used for clustering and visualization of high-dimensional data by mapping it to a lower-dimensional grid. The size and shape of the grid, as well as the number of clusters, can significantly affect the clustering results.

The context also mentions the use of Support Vector Machines (SVM) for large-scale partitioning. SVM is a type of supervised learning algorithm that can be used for classification, regression, and other tasks. It is particularly useful for high-dimensional data and can handle a large number of features.

In summary, based on the provided context, the deep learning models mentioned are used for clustering and large-scale partitioning, specifically Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) networks and Support Vector Machines (SVM). However, the context does not provide enough information to determine if the models are used for classification, segmentation, or detection.
