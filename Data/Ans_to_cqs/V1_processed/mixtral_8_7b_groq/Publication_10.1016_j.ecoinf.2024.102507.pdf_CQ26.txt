Based on the provided context, the research team addressed data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline mainly through data augmentation. Specifically, they used image rotation or overlapping plots to standardize the number of samples of different forest types. No explicit mention of techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection was found in the text.

In detail, the team observed a significant difference in the area of each forest type classification, which led to an imbalance in the training data. To tackle this issue, they explored three approaches for the dataset of input samples: (a) using the original data with varying numbers of samples and sizes depending on the area of each forest type, (b) reducing the data using a sampling method to force the number of samples of various forest types to be limited to the same, but facing a problem of different sampling ratios, and (c) applying data augmentation through image rotation or overlapping plots to standardize the number of samples of the forest type to the same.

The text suggests that the data augmentation approach (option c) was one of the optimal simulation results, achieving a high classification accuracy rate. Therefore, data augmentation was an effective technique to address data bias and improve the classification performance in this specific study. However, it is important to note that other techniques such as stratified sampling, oversampling, and undersampling could also be useful in different scenarios and should be considered as potential options for addressing data bias during preprocessing.
