The provided context discusses the evaluation of a fusion algorithm and various machine learning models, but it does not mention a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot directly answer the query regarding the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model.

However, I can provide some insight into the evaluation metrics mentioned in the context that are commonly used for model performance evaluation, including accuracy, precision, and recall.

1. Accuracy: It is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of input samples. In the context, cross-validation accuracy is used to assess the performance of the fusion algorithm and machine learning models.

2. Precision: It is the ratio of true positive predictions (relevant samples that are correctly identified) to the sum of true positives and false positives (irrelevant samples that are incorrectly identified as relevant).

3. Recall: It is the ratio of true positive predictions to the sum of true positives and false negatives (relevant samples that are incorrectly identified as irrelevant).

These metrics, along with others like F1-score (the harmonic mean of precision and recall) and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC), are widely used to evaluate the performance of machine learning and deep learning models. The choice of evaluation metric depends on the specific problem and the relative importance of false positives and false negatives.
