The provided context discusses various methods and parameters for image-based data collection, particularly in the context of ecological studies. However, it does not explicitly mention specific sensors or public datasets that are used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. Nevertheless, I can provide an answer based on general knowledge and the information given.

In the context of image-based data collection, there are several methods for collecting raw data. These methods can be categorized into survey types, imaging platforms, and imaging techniques.

1. Survey types:
   - Planned path execution along 2-3 spatial axes (mapping)
   - Fixed spatial position (stationary)
   - Planned path execution along a free path (survey)
   - Unplanned path execution (exploration)
   - Observation of a manipulated environment (experiment)
   - Ex-situ imaging of samples taken by other methods (sampling)

2. Imaging platforms:
   - 3D camera
   - Calibrated camera
   - Laser marker
   - Optical flow camera

3. Imaging techniques:
   - Grayscale, RGB, multi-spectral, and hyper-spectral imaging
   - Use of bait (type, quantity, position related to imagery)
   - Camera orientation to the subject (seafloor, water column, sea surface, atmosphere, laboratory)
   - Photo, video, and scan imagery
   - Insitu and exsitu imaging

Additionally, the context provides information on data capture settings, such as:

- Event date and time (singleDateTime / rangeOfDates)
- Image pixel resolution and magnitude
- Image field of view (dimensioned)
- Image-camera-orientation
- Image-illumination
- Image-scale-reference
- Image-practical-constraints
- Image-level capture
- Image-datetime
- Image-longitude, image-latitude, image-depth, image-meters-above-ground
- Image-acquisition-settings
- Image-pixel-per-millimeter
- Image-area-square-meter
- Image-curation-protocol
- Image-annotation-QAQC

While the context does not explicitly mention sensors or public datasets, it is possible to use various sensors (e.g., cameras, sonar, lidar) for data collection in the mentioned survey types and imaging platforms. Public datasets, such as ImageNet, COCO, or specific ecological datasets, can also be used as raw data sources in a deep learning pipeline.

In summary, the provided context discusses various methods for image-based data collection in ecological studies. However, it does not explicitly mention sensors or public datasets. Therefore, the answer is based on general knowledge and the information given.
