While the provided context does not directly discuss strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value, it does mention techniques used to address other challenges in deep learning, particularly in the context of seagrass coverage estimation.

Deep learning models often incorporate randomness during training, for example, through the use of random initial weights, random data shuffling, and dropout regularization. These techniques help to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization ability of the model. The random seed value is used to control this randomness, ensuring reproducibility of the results.

The context highlights the challenge of data distribution shifts between different locations, which is a distinct issue from randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Researchers have proposed domain adaptation techniques to mitigate this problem. Islam et al. (2019) developed a domain adaptation model using a generative adversarial network to align marginal data distributions between the target and source domains. This approach aims to improve the model's performance when applied to new, unseen locations.

In summary, deep learning models incorporate randomness during training to improve generalization, and the random seed value is used to control this randomness. The context, however, mainly focuses on addressing data distribution shifts between different locations, with techniques such as domain adaptation.
