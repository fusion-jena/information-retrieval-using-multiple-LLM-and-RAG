In the context provided, there is no explicit mention of techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, there are some related concepts that can be discussed.

One common technique to address data bias is to ensure diverse data collection. This involves collecting data from various sources and ensuring that the data is representative of the population that the model will be applied to. This can help to reduce bias in the model by ensuring that it is exposed to a wide variety of examples during training.

Another technique is stratified splitting, which involves dividing the data into subgroups based on certain characteristics, and then randomly sampling from each subgroup to create the training, validation, and test sets. This can help to ensure that each set is representative of the overall population and that the model is exposed to a diverse range of examples.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to address class imbalance in the data. Class imbalance occurs when one class has significantly more examples than another class. This can lead to bias in the model, as it may become overfit to the majority class. Oversampling involves creating more examples of the minority class, while undersampling involves reducing the number of examples of the majority class.

In the context of agricultural pests recognition, there are several papers that discuss data preprocessing techniques. For example, [18] discusses the use of a deep learning CNN architecture applied in smart near-infrared analysis of water pollution for agricultural irrigation resources. While they do not explicitly mention techniques to address data bias, they do discuss data preprocessing techniques such as normalization and augmentation.

[19] presents a large-scale benchmark dataset for insect pest recognition and discusses data preprocessing techniques such as data cleaning, normalization, and augmentation. However, they do not mention techniques to address data bias.

[20] discusses an improved deep learning pipeline for automatic localization and count of agricultural crop pests. They mention data preprocessing techniques such as data cleaning, normalization, and augmentation, but do not mention techniques to address data bias.

[21] presents a benchmarking of learning strategies for pest detection and identification on tomato plants for autonomous scouting robots using internal databases. They discuss data preprocessing techniques such as data cleaning, normalization, and augmentation, but do not mention techniques to address data bias.

In conclusion, while there are no explicit mentions of techniques to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline in the provided context, there are related concepts such as diverse data collection, stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling. Additionally, several papers discuss data preprocessing techniques for agricultural pests recognition, but do not mention techniques to address data bias.
