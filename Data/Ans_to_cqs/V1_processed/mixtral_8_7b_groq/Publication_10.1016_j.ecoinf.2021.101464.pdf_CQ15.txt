The provided context does not contain information about the optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the use of random forest models for analyzing the relationship between negative air ions (NAI) and environmental factors.

The optimization techniques mentioned in the context are related to the parameter optimization of the random forest model. These techniques include simulation and sorting of importance scores (VI) for selected variables. However, these techniques are specific to the random forest model and not deep learning pipelines.

Deep learning pipelines typically use optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad for optimizing model parameters. These techniques help minimize the loss function and improve the model's performance.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot answer the query about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
