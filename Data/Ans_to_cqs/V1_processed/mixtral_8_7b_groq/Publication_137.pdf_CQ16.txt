The criteria used to determine when training is complete in the context provided is not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred that the training process involves adjusting various parameters such as the voxel size, regularization strength, and batch size. The authors mention that they used the hold-out method to distinguish the test set and the training set at a ratio of 3:7 for preprocessing the original data. They further adjust the parameters of networks to explore the influence of parameters on experimental results.

The tables provided in the context show the test results for different combinations of voxel size, regularization strength, and batch size. The authors use overall accuracy (OA) and mean intersection over union (mIoU) as metrics to evaluate the performance of their model. However, there is no mention of any criteria related to validation loss plateau or any other validation metric being used to determine when training is complete.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be said that the authors did not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete.
