The provided context does not contain information about the deployment of a trained deep learning model. The text focuses on the analysis of observational complex networks, specifically in the context of the urban acoustic environment (AE), and does not mention any steps taken to serialize a model or select a platform for deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
