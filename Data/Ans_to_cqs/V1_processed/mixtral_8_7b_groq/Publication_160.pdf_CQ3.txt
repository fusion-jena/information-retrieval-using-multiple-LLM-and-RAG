The context provided does not give specific details about the type of data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that a large database of annotated photographic quadrats was used for training the algorithm. Annotated photographic quadrats typically involve labeling or identifying specific objects or species of interest in a photograph. This could range from simple point annotations indicating the presence of a particular species, to more complex annotations such as bounding boxes or instance segmentation, which provide more precise location and spatial extent information.

In the context of coralligenous species identification, instance segmentation could be particularly useful for accurately differentiating and counting individual species instances, even when they overlap or are occluded by other objects in the image. However, the specific annotation techniques used in this study are not mentioned.

Additionally, the study mentions the use of an ensemble network for multi-scale prediction, which suggests that the algorithm was trained on image patches at different scales or resolutions. This is a common technique in deep learning for computer vision tasks, as it allows the model to capture features at different scales and improve overall performance. In the context of image annotation, this could involve annotating objects or species of interest at different scales or resolutions, depending on the specific task and dataset.

Overall, while the context does not provide specific details about the type of data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it does suggest that annotated photographic quadrats and multi-scale image patches were used for training the algorithm.
