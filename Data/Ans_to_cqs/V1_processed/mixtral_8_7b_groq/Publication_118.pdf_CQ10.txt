Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text mentions that the architecture is based on a version from a GitHub user "eelxpeng," but it does not specify if the entire pipeline is available in that repository or if there is a different repository for this particular study.

Therefore, I would recommend contacting the corresponding author, Benjamin Rowe, at his email address: benjamin.rowe@hdr.qut.edu.au, to inquire about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study.
