The provided context does not explicitly name the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention the use of specific datasets in the training and evaluation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for cetacean vocalization detection.

The first dataset, referred to as SWAMS, consists of 7 hours of audio signals recorded during the OHASISBIO program in the Indian Ocean's oceanic zone, between Kerguelen and Amsterdam Island. These recordings were made in March 2015 using a hydrophone deployed at a depth of 1000 m with a sampling rate of 240 Hz. A total of 102 vocalizations were manually annotated by a second expert.

The second dataset is not explicitly named but is mentioned as a set of datasets containing other SEIO PBW vocalizations and blue whale's Dcall. Only a small portion of these datasets was used to reduce computational time, as hundreds of networks were trained and compared.

It is important to note that the focus of this study is not on the datasets themselves but rather on the development and evaluation of methods for addressing annotation discrepancies and optimizing the potential of multi-annotation campaigns involving both expert and novice annotators. The study aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of cetacean vocalization detection using deep learning models by addressing the challenges associated with the scarcity of ground truth data in underwater Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) studies.
