Based on the given context, there is no explicit information about the specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning models. However, we can infer some possible preprocessing steps from the information provided.

Firstly, in the methodology diagram (Figure 1), there is a module named "Preprocessing of historical images" (purple, sec. 2.1). This suggests that some form of preprocessing is applied to the original image database. However, the specific preprocessing steps are not mentioned.

Secondly, in the case of fish segmentation (sec. 2.2), the authors used images of individual fishes once the segmentation is done as an example (Fig. 3). This implies that the original images containing multiple fishes were preprocessed to extract individual fish images, possibly through a segmentation process.

Lastly, for fish classification by species (sec. 2.3), the authors used a pre-trained ResNet50V2 model with the ImageNet dataset. ImageNet is a large-scale image dataset that has been preprocessed and standardized, implying that the images were normalized, resized, and possibly augmented before being used for training.

Therefore, while the specific preprocessing steps are not provided in the context, it can be inferred that the preprocessing may have included steps such as image normalization, scaling, cleaning, and possibly augmentation.
