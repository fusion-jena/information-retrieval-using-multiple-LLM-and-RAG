The provided context does not contain specific information about strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does mention improvements in deep learning models (Ren et al., 2021; Wu, 2022) and other machine learning models like random forest (Jiang et al., 2021; Lian et al., 2022), support vector machines (Hong et al., 2018), Bayesian networks (Che et al., 2019), and mixed effects (Yu et al., 2021a). These models can potentially incorporate methods to handle randomness.

In deep learning, a common way to handle randomness is by setting a fixed seed value. This ensures that the random number generator used in the model produces the same sequence of random numbers in every run, which in turn ensures that the model's weights are initialized to the same values and that the training data is shuffled in the same order during each training epoch. This can help to make the training process more reproducible and stable.

Other strategies to handle randomness in machine learning models include:

1. Cross-validation: This technique involves dividing the data into several folds, training the model on different subsets of the data, and averaging the results. This can help to reduce the impact of random fluctuations in the training data.

2. Regularization: This technique involves adding a penalty term to the loss function to prevent the model from overfitting to the training data. This can help to make the model more robust to random noise in the data.

3. Ensemble methods: These methods involve training multiple models on the same data and combining their predictions. This can help to reduce the impact of random errors in any individual model.

4. Bootstrapping: This technique involves sampling the data with replacement to create multiple training sets. This can help to reduce the impact of random fluctuations in the training data.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not contain specific information about strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value, it is common practice in deep learning and machine learning to use such strategies to ensure reproducibility, stability, and robustness.
