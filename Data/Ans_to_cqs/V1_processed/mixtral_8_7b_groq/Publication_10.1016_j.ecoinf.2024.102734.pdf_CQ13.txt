The provided context does not give specific details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning models, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The hyperparameters for each model (ResNet-50, Audio Spectrogram Transformer, and HuBERT) were implemented based on the recommendations outlined by the authors of each model. However, the exact values or specific configurations are not provided in the text. Therefore, I cannot give a specific answer to this query.
