Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used in the bioacoustic research pipeline to classify vocalizations. Pre-trained models like VGG16, ResNet101V2, and ResNet152V2 are recommended as starting points for researchers. CNNs with a frozen feature extractor can be useful when dealing with small datasets.
