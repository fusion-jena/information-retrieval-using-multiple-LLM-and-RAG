The provided context discusses various methods for gathering and visualizing soil information, but it does not explicitly mention the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer that the raw data collection in a deep learning pipeline for soil analysis could involve techniques such as soil surveys, sensors, and public datasets.

Soil surveys are a common method for collecting detailed soil information from specific sites. Technicians typically gather this information through direct sampling and present it as raw data to professionals. This raw data can then be used as input for a deep learning pipeline.

Sensors, particularly remote sensing data and web-based APIs, can be utilized to collect large-scale soil data. For instance, resources like Crop-CASMA (Zhang et al., 2022) can provide US soil moisture data, which could be used in a deep learning pipeline for soil analysis.

Public datasets are another potential source of raw data for a deep learning pipeline. These datasets can offer a wealth of information, including soil properties, land use, and climate data. Examples include the SoilGrids250m dataset, which provides global gridded soil property and class maps, and the USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) databases, which offer various soil surveys and reports.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the deep learning pipeline, we can infer that raw data collection for soil analysis in a deep learning pipeline could involve soil surveys, sensors (remote sensing data and web-based APIs), and public datasets.
