The performance of the deep learning model in GreenCam is evaluated using Intersection over Union (IOU) and Pixel Accuracy (PA). These metrics are used to assess the accuracy of the model in segmenting different categories such as tree, lawn, shrub, flower, flat, sky, facility, and architecture.

Intersection over Union (IOU) is a measure of the overlap between the predicted segmentation and the ground truth. It is calculated as the area of overlap between the predicted and actual segmentation divided by the area of union of the two segmentations. A higher IOU score indicates better segmentation accuracy.

Pixel Accuracy (PA) is the percentage of pixels in the image that are correctly classified. It is calculated as the number of correctly classified pixels divided by the total number of pixels in the image. A higher PA score indicates better overall accuracy of the model.

In addition to these metrics, the model's performance is also evaluated in terms of mIOU, accuracy, and F1-score. However, the context does not provide a detailed explanation of these metrics.

It is worth noting that the performance of the SegFormer model is compared with other widely-used segmenters such as FCN, HRNet, PSPNet, and DeepLabV3+ on the UGE-D dataset. The SegFormer outperforms these models in terms of mIOU, accuracy, and F1-score, indicating its stronger segmentation performance across different categories.

Therefore, the performance of the deep learning model in GreenCam is evaluated using IOU and PA, which provide a measure of the accuracy of the model in segmenting different categories.
