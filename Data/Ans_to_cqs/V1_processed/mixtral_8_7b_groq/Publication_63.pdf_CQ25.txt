The deep learning models mentioned in the context are used for regression tasks, specifically for predicting plant functional traits from RGB photographs. These models are built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and employ transfer learning, where pre-trained layer weights from a classification task on the ImageNet dataset are used. The CNN models consist of a global average pooling layer followed by two dense layers that force the CNN to output exactly one prediction value. In the case of the mixed data model, the CNN consists of parallel branches to incorporate different input data types, such as bioclimatic data. The final model performance is assessed using a 3-fold cross-validation and normalized mean absolute error. The purpose of these models is to predict plant functional traits, such as plant and organ size (GH, LA) and leaf economics spectrum (SLA), from RGB photographs, thereby potentially overcoming the limitations of geographical coverage in existing trait databases.
