The code repository for the deep learning pipeline has not been specified in the given context. The text mentions that R scripts are provided, but it does not indicate where these scripts can be found or if they are part of a larger repository on a platform like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
