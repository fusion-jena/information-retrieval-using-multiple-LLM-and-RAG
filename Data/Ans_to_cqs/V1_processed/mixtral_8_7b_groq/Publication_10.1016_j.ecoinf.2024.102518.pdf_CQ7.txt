In summary, the provided context discusses the methodology for selecting optimal model parameters and evaluating model performance in a species distribution modeling study. However, it does not explicitly mention the criteria used for splitting the data for deep learning model training. Common practices for data splitting in deep learning include dividing the data into training, validation, and test sets using methods such as random sampling, stratified sampling, or time-series splitting.
