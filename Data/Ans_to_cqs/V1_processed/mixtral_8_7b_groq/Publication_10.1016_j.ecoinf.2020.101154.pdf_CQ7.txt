In the context provided, there are two data splitting approaches mentioned for machine learning model training: a two-part split and a three-part split. However, the text does not explicitly mention these approaches in the context of deep learning. Nevertheless, I will explain the two data splitting methods and how they are used in the given context.

1. Two-part split:
In a two-part split, the data is divided into a training set and a test set. Hyperparameters, which are the parameters that are set before the learning process begins, are tuned using grid search. Grid search performs an exhaustive search over specified parameter values for an estimator and evaluates a model trained on each element of the Cartesian product of the sets. This process automatically generates the validation sets internally, and there is no need to generate a separate validation set to select the best model.

For the RI models, the same initial parameters were set for the analysis of the CS and NW datasets. Then, a grid search was performed on both datasets with a two-part split to give hyperparameters with the highest level of accuracy. These hyperparameters were a learning rate of 0.05 and a maximum tree depth of 4 for both the CS and NW models.

2. Three-part split:
In a three-part split, the data is divided into a training set, a validation set, and a test set. The validation set is used instead of the test set to tune the values in the parameters grid to find values that improve the score. Once there is confidence that the validation score cannot be further improved via parameter tweaking or feature engineering, the best model is evaluated on the final test set (only once). In some instances, the final test score may be lower than the validation score. In that case, the test score is taken as the most realistic evaluation of the true generalization performance of the final model.

For the RY data splitting, individual observations were grouped according to the year of capture, and years were randomly selected for inclusion in the train and test datasets. Although this may produce systematic differences between the test and train datasets, it ensures that the model is tested using previously unseen combinations of explanatory variables and is therefore a more robust test of model performance in this context.

In summary, the two data splitting approaches mentioned in the provided context are the two-part split and the three-part split. The two-part split is used for hyperparameter tuning using grid search, while the three-part split is used for a more robust test of model performance by evaluating the model on previously unseen combinations of explanatory variables. However, the text does not explicitly mention these approaches in the context of deep learning.
