The provided context does not contain information about deep learning pipelines or data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context focuses on species distribution modeling, using an ensemble modeling approach in the BIOMOD2 package in R, and evaluating model performance using cross-validation and the Area Under the Receiving Operator Characteristics Curve (AUC). The predictor variables used in the models include bioclimatic variables (Bio1, Bio4, Bio7, Bio15, Bio17) and distance-to-roads (DRO) and distance-to-rivers (DR).
