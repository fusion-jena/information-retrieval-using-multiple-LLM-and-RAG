The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include affine transformations, pixel sum transformation, hue, saturation, and contrast modifications, and adding Gaussian noise to images. Affine transformations consist of scaling, translation, rotation, and shear. These techniques are carefully selected so as not to generate images that could never actually be found. For instance, mirror flipping would be a wrong selection for studying the pattern in the skin of individuals of the undulate skate since this technique would change it completely, invalidating the generated image. The data augmentation techniques are applied before splitting the sample into the training, validation, and test sets. This is done to encourage the variability of images of the same individual, helping the model to learn and to fine-tune the parameters of the algorithm. An original photo and an example of the resulting output of applying each selected data augmentation technique are shown in Figure 3.
