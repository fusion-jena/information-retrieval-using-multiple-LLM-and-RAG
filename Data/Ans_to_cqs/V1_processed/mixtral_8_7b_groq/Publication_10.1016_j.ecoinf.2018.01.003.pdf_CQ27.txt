Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model. However, the text does mention the use of deep learning algorithms (Hinton and Salakhutdinov, 2006) for obtaining deeply hidden characteristic information and features. It also mentions the use of artificial neural networks (ANN) (Qaderi, F., Babanejad, E., 2017) and support vector machines (SVM) (Xu, L., 1997) for predictive modeling.

In the context of the study by Liu and Lei (2018), they used a backpropagation neural network (BPNN) model, which is a type of ANN, to predict the ecological footprint (EF) of Beijing. They trained the model using data from 1996 to 2013, and tested it using data from 2014 and 2015. The training process involved setting a tolerance of 0 and a least allowable gradient of 1e-5, and using 5-time cross-validation to optimize the parameters. The network converged after 50-100 iterations.

However, the text does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed or implemented in a production environment. There is no mention of model serialization, platform selection, or any other steps typically involved in model deployment. Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer this query fully.
