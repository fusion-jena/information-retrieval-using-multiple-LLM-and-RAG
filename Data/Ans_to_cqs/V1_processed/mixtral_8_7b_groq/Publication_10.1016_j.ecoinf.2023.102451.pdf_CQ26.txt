The provided context discusses the use of data augmentation and normalization as preprocessing steps for addressing the diversity of training data and data imbalance problems in a classification task. However, it does not explicitly mention the techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection for addressing data bias during preprocessing.

Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the size of the training dataset by creating modified versions of the existing images. This can help in improving the model's performance by providing more diverse data and reducing overfitting. Normalization is the process of scaling the pixel values of the images to a common range, which can help in improving the model's convergence and stability during training.

While the context does not mention specific techniques for addressing data bias, data augmentation can help in reducing bias by creating a more diverse training dataset. For example, by flipping, rotating, or zooming images, the model can learn to be more invariant to these transformations, which can help in reducing bias due to differences in image orientation or scale.

In addition, the use of the SCPSA block in the CNN module of the EMViT-Net model can help in extracting depth-wise features from the images, which can improve the model's ability to capture local patterns and structures in the data. This can help in reducing bias due to differences in local features between different classes.

Overall, while the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing, the use of data augmentation and normalization, as well as the integration of the SCPSA block in the CNN module, can help in reducing bias and improving the model's performance on imbalanced datasets.
