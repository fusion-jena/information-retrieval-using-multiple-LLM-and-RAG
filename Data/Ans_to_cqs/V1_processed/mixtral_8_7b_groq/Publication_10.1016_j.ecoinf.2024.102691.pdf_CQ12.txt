The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically the YOLOv5 model with a depth-attention mechanism. This information can be inferred from the context provided, which mentions the use of a depth-attention YOLOv5 model for fruit detection. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a popular object detection model that uses a CNN as its backbone. Additionally, the context does not mention any other type of deep learning model such as RNN or Transformer.

Furthermore, the paper "Noise-tolerant RGB-D feature fusion network for outdoor fruit detection" by S. Qixin et al. (2022) also mentions the use of a CNN for fruit detection, stating that "the proposed network is a CNN-based network". Although this paper does not explicitly mention the use of YOLOv5, it does mention the use of a depth-attention mechanism, which further supports the inference that a CNN with a depth-attention mechanism is being used.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of pre-trained models such as VGG16, which is a well-known CNN architecture. This further reinforces the inference that a CNN is being used in the pipeline.

In summary, based on the provided context, the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically the YOLOv5 model with a depth-attention mechanism.
