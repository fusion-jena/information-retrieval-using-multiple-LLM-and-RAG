In the contexts provided, there is one instance where a specific strategy is mentioned to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline. In the document "Automated plant species classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)" by U. Bayr and O. Puschmann (2019), spatial dropout is used to prevent overfitting and improve generalization in the CNN model. Spatial dropout is a regularization technique that randomly drops entire feature maps instead of individual neurons, which helps prevent overfitting by reducing the co-adaptation of feature maps (Tompson et al., 2014). This technique introduces randomness during the training process, which helps the model to be more robust and less prone to overfitting.

In addition to spatial dropout, deep learning pipelines may also employ other strategies to handle randomness. One common approach is to set a random seed value to ensure reproducibility of the results. By setting a seed value, the random number generator used in the pipeline will produce the same sequence of random numbers, which ensures that the same initial weights are used for each training run and that the same data splits are used for training, validation, and testing. This can help to ensure that the results are reproducible and that any differences in performance are due to changes in the model or data, rather than randomness in the training process.

Another strategy to handle randomness is to use techniques such as cross-validation, which involves dividing the data into multiple folds and training the model on different subsets of the data. This can help to reduce the impact of randomness in the training process, as the model is trained and tested on multiple different subsets of the data. This can help to ensure that the model is able to generalize well to new data, rather than simply memorizing the training data.

Overall, deep learning pipelines may employ a variety of strategies to handle randomness, including setting a random seed value, using regularization techniques such as spatial dropout, and using techniques such as cross-validation to reduce the impact of randomness in the training process. By employing these strategies, deep learning pipelines can help to ensure that the results are reproducible and that the model is able to generalize well to new data.
