Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. Hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization are not mentioned.

However, the text does mention that the system uses active learning, which involves the user in the optimization of the system. In active learning, the system forwards images to humans for annotation at certain intervals, and then uses these annotated images to train a classifier iteratively. This process could potentially include hyperparameter optimization, but the text does not provide enough details to make a definitive conclusion.

Furthermore, the text mentions that the system aims to minimize the labeling effort to be made manually. This suggests that the system might use automated techniques for hyperparameter optimization, such as using a validation set to tune hyperparameters during the training process.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly answer the query about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, it does suggest that the system might use automated techniques for hyperparameter optimization within the active learning process.
