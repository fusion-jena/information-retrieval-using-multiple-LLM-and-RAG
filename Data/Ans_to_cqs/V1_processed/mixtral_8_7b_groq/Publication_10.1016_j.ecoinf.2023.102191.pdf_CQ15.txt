Based on the provided context, there is no information about the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for this particular application. The text focuses on the development and testing of a mobile app for marine life monitoring by recreational divers, including data collection, user feedback, and basic statistical analysis. It does not mention the implementation of optimization algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional information.
