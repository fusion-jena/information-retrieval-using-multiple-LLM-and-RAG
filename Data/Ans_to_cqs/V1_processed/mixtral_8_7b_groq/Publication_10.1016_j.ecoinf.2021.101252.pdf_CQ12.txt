The deep learning models used in the pipeline include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), Residual Networks (ResNet), and InceptionTime. These models are used in different architectures and combinations throughout the case studies presented in the text.

In Case Study 1, the architectures include ResNet, InceptionTime, LSTM, and CNN. The candidate models' accuracy percentages vary, and the selected model has an AUC of 0.91.

In Case Study 2, the architectures used are ResNet, InceptionTime, LSTM, and CNN, with the AutoML procedure generating a set of candidate models with different architectures and hyperparameters. The best-performing candidate model is then selected and trained on the full training data.

Case Study 3 also utilizes ResNet, InceptionTime, LSTM, and CNN architectures. The accuracy percentages of the candidate models vary, with the text not explicitly mentioning the AUC of the selected model.

Throughout the case studies, these deep learning models are used to process the input data and make predictions. CNNs are primarily used for image processing tasks, while LSTMs are a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that excel in processing sequential data. ResNets are designed to solve the degradation problem in deep neural networks by introducing skip connections, allowing the model to learn from the residual functions directly. InceptionTime is a deep learning model specifically designed for time series classification tasks, using the Inception architecture.

In summary, the deep learning models used in the pipeline consist of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), Residual Networks (ResNet), and InceptionTime. These models are employed in various architectures and combinations throughout the case studies, with the AutoML procedure generating and selecting the best-performing candidate models based on their accuracy and AUC.
