The deep learning pipeline can handle various data formats, including image, audio, video, and CSV files.

Images are commonly used in deep learning applications such as object detection, image segmentation, and image classification. In the context provided, the Cspnet backbone is used to enhance the learning capability of CNN for computer vision tasks. The proposed detector-2 is based on EfficientDet-B7, which is a well-optimized framework for object detection tasks with input image sizes ranging from 512 to 1536 pixels.

Audio data is also used in deep learning applications such as speech recognition, music generation, and emotion detection. Deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are commonly used for audio data processing.

Video data is another format used in deep learning applications such as object tracking, action recognition, and video summarization. In the context provided, Weidmann et al. (2019) used semantic segmentation for visual coverage estimation of seagrass meadows using underwater video data.

CSV files are used in deep learning applications such as regression, classification, and time-series forecasting. In the context provided, Xu et al. (2021) proposed a forest fire detection system based on ensemble learning using CSV files containing weather data.

In summary, deep learning pipelines can handle various data formats, including image, audio, video, and CSV files. The choice of data format depends on the specific deep learning application and the type of data available.
