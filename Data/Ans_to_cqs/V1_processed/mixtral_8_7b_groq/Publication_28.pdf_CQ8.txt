Based on the provided context, there is no information about the specific code repository for a deep learning pipeline related to satellite image classification. The sources mentioned in the context are research papers and articles that discuss various approaches and techniques for satellite image classification using deep learning.

The papers include "A free search krill herd algorithm for functions optimization" by Li, L., Zhou, Y., and Xie, J. (2014), "Multi-label remote sensing image scene classification by combining a convolutional neural network and a graph neural network" by Li, Y., Chen, R., Zhang, Y., Zhang, M., and Chen, L. (2020), "Deepsat v2: feature augmented convolutional neural nets for satellite image classification" by Liu, Q., Basu, S., Ganguly, S., Mukhopadhyay, S., DiBiano, R., Karki, M., and Nemani, R. (2020), and "Apache spark accelerated deep learning inference for large scale satellite image analytics" by Lunga, D., Gerrand, J., Yang, L., Layton, C., and Stewart, R. (2020).

Additionally, there is a reference to a figure (Fig. 11) from a paper titled "Computation time analysis of PTDLEN-VAE model on AID dataset," but there is no information about the code repository for this specific model.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific code repository for the deep learning pipeline related to satellite image classification based on the given context.
