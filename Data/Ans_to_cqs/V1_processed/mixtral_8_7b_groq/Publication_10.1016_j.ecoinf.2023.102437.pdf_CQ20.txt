The pieces of context provided do not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, they do mention the use of deep learning models such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which are often trained using specialized hardware such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) to accelerate the training process.

In the paper "Enhancing land cover/land use (LCLU) classification through a comparative analysis of hyperparameters optimization approaches for deep neural network (DNN)" by Azedou et al., 2023, the authors mention the use of deep neural networks for land cover/land use classification, but they do not specify the hardware resources used for training.

In the paper "El Niño, La Niña, and recurrent neural network (RNN) model for rice yield prediction in Central Colombia" by Bonato et al., 2023, the authors mention the use of RNN and LSTM models for rice yield prediction, but they do not specify the hardware resources used for training.

It is worth noting that, in general, deep learning models can be computationally intensive and require a significant amount of processing power, memory, and storage. Therefore, it is common practice to use specialized hardware such as GPUs or TPUs to train these models. However, the specific hardware resources used for training the models in these studies are not provided.
