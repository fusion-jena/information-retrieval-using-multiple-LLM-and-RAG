The provided context does not contain information about the specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model for predicting potential natural vegetation (PNV). The text focuses on the scarcity and noise of labels in real-world predictive tasks and introduces a new computational setting for regression where target labels are structurally incomplete. It also discusses various statistical techniques and machine learning methods employed for PNV modeling, but it does not mention any specific hyperparameters.

In general, hyperparameters used in deep learning models can include the learning rate, optimizer, number of layers, number of neurons per layer, activation functions, batch size, and the number of epochs. The choice of these hyperparameters depends on the specific problem, dataset, and model architecture.

To determine the appropriate hyperparameters for a deep learning model for PNV prediction, one could use a combination of methods such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization. These methods involve systematically searching through a range of hyperparameter values and evaluating the model's performance using cross-validation or a separate validation set. The hyperparameters that result in the best performance can then be used for the final model.

Therefore, while the provided context does not give information about the specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model for PNV prediction, it is essential to consider the appropriate hyperparameters for the model's success.
