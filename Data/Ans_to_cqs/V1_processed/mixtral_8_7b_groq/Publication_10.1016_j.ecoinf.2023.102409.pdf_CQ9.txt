The context provided does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It mentions several studies and papers, but none of them specify where the data repository is located. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query. However, it is common for researchers to share their data in open-access repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. I would recommend checking these platforms or contacting the authors of the relevant studies for more information.
