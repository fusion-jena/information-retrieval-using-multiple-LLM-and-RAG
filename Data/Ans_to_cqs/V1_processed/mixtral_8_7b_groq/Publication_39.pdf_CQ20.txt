The provided context does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. It only mentions that all programs use Python 3 and PyTorch for building and training the networks. PyTorch is a popular open-source machine learning library that can be used for training deep learning models on various hardware resources, such as CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs. However, the context does not specify which of these resources were used for training. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
