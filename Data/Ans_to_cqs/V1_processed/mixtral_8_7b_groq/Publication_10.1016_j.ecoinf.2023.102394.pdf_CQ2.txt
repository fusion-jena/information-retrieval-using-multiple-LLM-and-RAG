The deep learning pipeline can utilize various data formats, including image, audio, video, and CSV files, depending on the specific application and problem being addressed.

In the context of the provided references, there are examples of deep learning being used with CSV files containing soil and climate data. For instance, Adhikari et al. (2019) used CSV files containing soil organic carbon stock data to assess the fate of soil organic carbon under future land use and climate change. Similarly, Abatzoglou et al. (2018) used CSV files containing climate and climatic water balance data to create the TerraClimate dataset.

In addition, deep learning techniques have been used in image analysis tasks. For example, Kalinaki et al. (2023) used deep learning to predict forest vegetation cover, which typically involves working with image data. Similarly, Wadoux et al. (2019) used multi-source data, including image data, to predict soil properties using deep learning.

While not explicitly mentioned in the provided references, deep learning can also be applied to audio and video data. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a popular deep learning architecture, have been used for audio signal processing and speech recognition tasks (Abadi et al., 2016). Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which are also deep learning models, have been used for video analysis and natural language processing tasks (Allaire & Chollet, 2018).

In summary, deep learning can be applied to various data formats, including image, audio, video, and CSV files. The specific data format used depends on the problem being addressed and the type of data available. The references provided demonstrate the use of deep learning with CSV files containing soil and climate data, as well as its application in image analysis tasks. However, deep learning can also be applied to audio and video data, as demonstrated in other research outside of the provided references.
