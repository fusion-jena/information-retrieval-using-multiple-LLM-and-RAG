The provided context does not give specific information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. Hyperparameter optimization is an important step in training machine learning models, and methods such as grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization are commonly used. However, the author contributions, references, and acknowledgements do not mention any of these methods or any other specific approach to hyperparameter optimization.

It is possible that the hyperparameters were optimized using a method that is not mentioned in the provided context. For example, the authors may have used a manual search or a more sophisticated method such as gradient-based optimization. Without more information, it is difficult to say for sure how the hyperparameters were optimized.

Another possibility is that the hyperparameters were not optimized at all. This is not ideal, as the choice of hyperparameters can have a significant impact on the performance of a machine learning model. However, it is not uncommon for researchers to use default hyperparameters or to use the same hyperparameters as in a previous study.

In summary, the provided context does not give specific information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. It is possible that a method such as grid search or random search was used, or that the hyperparameters were not optimized at all. Without more information, it is difficult to say for sure.
