The provided context does not give specific information about the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some sources of data and data types that could be used in such a pipeline.

The context mentions the use of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data, which is a type of remote sensing data commonly used in environmental studies. NDVI data is often provided in raster format, which is a grid of pixels with numerical values representing vegetation health or other environmental characteristics. This format could be used as input to a deep learning model for image analysis or other tasks.

The context also mentions socio-economic factor data, which could include demographic information, economic indicators, and other types of tabular data. This data is often provided in CSV (comma-separated values) format, which is a simple text format that can be easily read and processed by machines. CSV format could be used as input to a deep learning model for regression analysis, classification, or other tasks.

Furthermore, the context mentions the use of land use data, which could include spatial information about land cover, land use types, and other geographic features. This data is often provided in vector format, which represents geographic features as points, lines, or polygons with associated attributes. Vector format could be used as input to a deep learning model for spatial analysis, image segmentation, or other tasks.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific information about the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline, it does mention some sources of data and data types that could be used as input to such a pipeline. These include raster format for remote sensing data, CSV format for tabular data, and vector format for spatial data.
