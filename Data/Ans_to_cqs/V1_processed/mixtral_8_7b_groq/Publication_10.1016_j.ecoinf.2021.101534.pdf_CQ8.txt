Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about where the code repository for the deep learning pipeline is available. The text discusses a case study involving a CNN-based approach for automated information extraction from soundscape recordings, but it does not mention the location of the code. It is possible that the code has not been made publicly available. If you are interested in the code, I would recommend reaching out to the authors of the study, S.-H. Wu et al., for more information.
