Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that a deep learning algorithm was used for strategic planning in a report from 1998, and there are several recent studies that have used deep learning models for various purposes.

In the study by Ren et al. (2023), they used a deep learning algorithm to analyze the ecosystem service value and changes in food supply and demand in Liaoning Province. However, there is no information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model.

In the study by Gu et al. (2024), they fused optimal parametric geoprobes with partial least squares structural equations to analyze the effects of topography, climate, and human activities on the spatial pattern of kNDVI. Although they did not explicitly mention using a deep learning model, they did use a fusion of models, which could include measures to ensure generalizability.

In general, there are several measures that can be taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, and stratified splitting. A diverse dataset can help ensure that the model is exposed to a wide range of inputs and can therefore make more accurate predictions on new data. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets, training the model on the training set, and then evaluating its performance on the testing set. This process can be repeated multiple times with different subsets of the data to ensure that the model is not overfitting to the training data. Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on certain characteristics, such as class labels, and then randomly sampling from each subgroup to create the training and testing sets. This can help ensure that the distribution of classes in the training and testing sets is similar to that in the original dataset.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, it is likely that one or more of these measures were taken.
