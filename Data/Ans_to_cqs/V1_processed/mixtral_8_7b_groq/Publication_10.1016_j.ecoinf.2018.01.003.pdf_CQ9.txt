Based on the provided context, there is no information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the development and application of deep learning algorithms, as well as other machine learning models such as Bayesian learning machines, artificial neural networks (ANNs), and support vector machines (SVMs). However, there is no mention of where the data used in these studies is stored or shared.

The context does provide details about specific studies that used ANNs and SVMs for various predictive tasks, such as predicting ecological footprints, carbon emissions, and water issues. These studies used datasets from various sources, such as Beijing's productive land-related areas and groundwater remediation costs. However, the context does not mention whether these datasets are publicly available or where they can be accessed.

In addition, the context mentions other studies that used SVMs for predicting the distribution of invasive species and estimating daily global solar radiation. These studies likely used specific datasets related to species distribution and solar radiation, but the context does not provide information about these datasets' availability.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
