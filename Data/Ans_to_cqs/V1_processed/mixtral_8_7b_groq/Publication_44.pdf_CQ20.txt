The context does not provide specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the model was implemented using Keras with TensorFlow backend, which suggests that the training could have been done on a GPU, as TensorFlow is designed to run on both CPUs and GPUs, and Keras supports GPU acceleration. It is also possible that other hardware resources such as TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) were used, but this information is not provided in the context. Therefore, while it is likely that GPUs were used for training, the specific hardware resources cannot be definitively determined from the given context.
