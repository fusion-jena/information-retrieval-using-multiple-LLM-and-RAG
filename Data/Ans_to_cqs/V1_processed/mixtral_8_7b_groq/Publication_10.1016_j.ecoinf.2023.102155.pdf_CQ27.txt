Based on the provided context, there is no information about the training and deployment of a deep learning model. The context mainly discusses the comparison of different methods for species distribution modeling, specifically the "LoopA" method, individual method, and CoinF method. It mentions the use of the "ppmlasso" package, but it does not provide details about training or deploying a deep learning model.

The context includes information on the "ppmlassoMixEngine" and "ppmlassoLoopEngine" functions, which are part of the "ppmlasso" package. However, these functions seem to be related to the implementation of the Loop methods for species distribution modeling, rather than deep learning model training or deployment.

The mentioned "ppmlasso" package has some parameters related to spatial resolution, observer bias proxy, and the number of models to fit through the regularization path. These parameters are used in the context of species distribution modeling, not deep learning model training or deployment.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query regarding the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, as the context does not contain any information about deep learning model training or deployment.
