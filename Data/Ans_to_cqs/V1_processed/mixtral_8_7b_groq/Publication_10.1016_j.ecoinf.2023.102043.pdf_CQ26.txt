The provided context discusses a deep learning pipeline for goat vocalization detection, which uses transfer learning based on YAMNet. However, it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer based on the given context.

However, I can give some general techniques that are commonly used to address data bias in machine learning:

1. Stratified sampling: This technique ensures that the training, validation, and testing sets have approximately the same percentage of samples for each class as the original dataset. This can help prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.
2. Oversampling: In cases where one class has significantly fewer samples than the other classes, oversampling can be used to increase the number of samples from the minority class. This can be done by randomly duplicating samples from the minority class or by using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to generate synthetic samples.
3. Undersampling: Alternatively, if one class has significantly more samples than the other classes, undersampling can be used to reduce the number of samples from the majority class. This can help prevent the model from being overwhelmed by the majority class.
4. Diverse data collection: Collecting data from a diverse range of sources can help ensure that the model is exposed to a wide variety of samples and is not biased towards a particular subset of the data.

It is possible that some of these techniques were used in the preprocessing of the goat vocalization dataset, but the provided context does not mention them explicitly.
