The provided context does not give specific details about the data preprocessing techniques used to address data bias. However, it does mention that the models were trained on large datasets, and the authors observed bias in the predictions for certain variables such as height-related variables P95 and MeanH, canopy density (Dens), and Gini coefficient (Gini).

From this information, we can infer that the authors may have used techniques such as stratified sampling, oversampling, or undersampling during the data preprocessing stage to ensure that the model is trained on a diverse and representative dataset. Stratified sampling involves dividing the dataset into different strata based on certain characteristics and then sampling from each stratum to ensure that the training data is representative of the entire population. Oversampling involves increasing the number of samples from the minority class, while undersampling involves decreasing the number of samples from the majority class.

Additionally, the authors may have also employed techniques such as data augmentation or feature engineering to increase the diversity of the training data and reduce bias. Data augmentation involves creating new synthetic samples by applying transformations such as rotation, scaling, or flipping to the existing data. Feature engineering involves creating new features from the existing data that can help the model better capture the underlying patterns and relationships.

However, these are just educated guesses based on the information provided in the context. To confirm the specific data preprocessing techniques used to address data bias, one would need to refer to the original paper or consult with the authors.
