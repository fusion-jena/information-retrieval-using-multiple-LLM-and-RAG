The provided context discusses data augmentation techniques used in the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline for image detection and classification, specifically using the EfficientNet model. However, it does not directly mention techniques to address data bias such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.

Data augmentation techniques like cropping, flipping, scaling, rotating, adding noise, and color transformation are used to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset. Random erasing is also used to improve model performance by introducing a degree of unpredictability during training. These techniques can indirectly help in reducing bias by increasing the variability of the training data.

Stratified sampling, oversampling, and undersampling are techniques used to ensure that the training dataset is representative of the entire dataset, especially when there are class imbalances. Stratified sampling ensures that the train-test split is done in such a way that the distribution of classes in the train and test sets is similar to that in the original dataset. Oversampling involves duplicating samples from the minority class to balance the dataset, while undersampling involves reducing the number of samples from the majority class. These techniques are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

Diverse data collection involves gathering data from various sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the real-world scenarios. While the context does mention the acquisition of new images, it does not explicitly discuss the diversity of the data collected.

In summary, while the provided context discusses data augmentation techniques, it does not directly mention techniques used to address data bias such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.
