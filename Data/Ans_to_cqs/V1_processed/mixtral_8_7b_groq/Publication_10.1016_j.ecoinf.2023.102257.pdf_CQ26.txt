The provided context discusses a study involving the use of machine learning (ML) in animal tagging and image classification, but it does not directly mention techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does touch upon the importance of having a diverse and representative dataset.

In the context of data preprocessing for deep learning, several techniques can be employed to mitigate data bias:

1. **Stratified splitting**: This technique involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on specific criteria (e.g., class labels) and then ensuring that each subgroup is proportionally represented in both the training and testing sets. This can help maintain balance and avoid bias in the data split.

2. **Oversampling**: When certain classes are underrepresented in the dataset, oversampling can be used to increase their presence. This can be done by replicating instances of the minority class or by generating synthetic data points using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).

3. **Undersampling**: Conversely, when certain classes are overrepresented, undersampling can be employed to reduce their presence. This can be done by randomly selecting a subset of instances from the majority class. However, this technique may lead to loss of valuable information.

4. **Diverse data collection**: Collecting data from various sources, locations, and conditions can help ensure that the dataset is diverse and representative. This can help reduce bias and improve the model's ability to generalize.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention these techniques, it does highlight the importance of having a well-represented dataset for drawing meaningful conclusions. In the context of the study, the dataset consisted of 6936 tagging events under three treatments, and the researchers found that ML bounding boxes offered significant improvement in tagging efficiency when labeling data compared to unassisted tagging. However, they also noted that incorrect ML predictions could slow the tagging process, emphasizing the importance of a high-quality dataset.
