The provided context discusses a method for identifying the species of a bat based on echolocation call data, but it does not directly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does touch on the concept of adjusting data based on certain features, which is related to the topic of data bias.

In the context, the researchers take into account the behavior of bats to adjust the means and standard deviations used in their analysis. This is similar to the technique of oversampling or undersampling in the context of data bias, where the goal is to adjust the class distribution in the training data to improve the performance of the model.

Stratified splitting is a technique used to ensure that the train and test datasets have the same proportion of samples for each target class as the complete dataset. This can be useful in cases where the dataset is imbalanced, and the goal is to ensure that the model is trained and tested on a representative sample of the data.

Diverse data collection is another technique that can be used to address data bias. By collecting data from a variety of sources, it is more likely that the dataset will be representative of the population, and the model will be less likely to be biased.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly mention the techniques of stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, it does touch on the concept of adjusting data based on certain features, which is related to the topic of data bias. These techniques can be used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline.
