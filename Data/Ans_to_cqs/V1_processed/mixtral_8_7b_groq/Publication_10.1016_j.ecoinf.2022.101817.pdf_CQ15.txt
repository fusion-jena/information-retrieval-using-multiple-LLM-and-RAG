Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of any optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that VGG16, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, is used in the pipeline. VGG16 is typically trained using some form of gradient descent optimization, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam.

For instance, in the paper "Classification of weather phenomenon from images by using deep convolutional neural network" (Xiao et al., 2021), the authors use the Adam optimizer for training their CNN. Similarly, in the paper "Underwater fish species classification using convolutional neural network and deep learning" (Rathi et al., 2017), the authors use the SGD optimizer with momentum for training their CNN.

Therefore, while the specific optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline in question is not mentioned, it is likely that some form of gradient descent optimization, such as SGD or Adam, was used.
