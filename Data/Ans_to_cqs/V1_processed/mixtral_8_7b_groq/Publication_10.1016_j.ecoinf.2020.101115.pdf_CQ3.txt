The provided context does not contain specific information about the data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the importance of using controlled vocabularies and metadata in the storage and management of data, particularly in the context of marine science and fish sampling.

In the context of deep learning, data annotation typically involves labeling data in a way that can be used to train machine learning models. Some common techniques include:

1. Image classification: Assigning a label to an entire image to indicate its content.
2. Object detection: Drawing bounding boxes around objects within an image and labeling them.
3. Semantic segmentation: Dividing an image into regions and labeling each region according to its content.
4. Instance segmentation: Similar to semantic segmentation, but each instance of an object is labeled separately.

The context provided does mention the use of the KEGG Orthology (KO) as a controlled vocabulary for automated genome annotation and pathway identification. This is an example of how a controlled vocabulary can be used to standardize the annotation of genomic data.

In the context of fish sampling, metadata such as fish length, weight, and day collected are typically written on sample envelopes. However, the context also notes that the internal vocabulary used during sample labeling within the Marine Institute (MI) field station changed through time and between researchers, and that local vocabularies used were often not in accordance with best practice. This highlights the importance of using controlled vocabularies to ensure consistent and accurate information labeling.

In summary, while the provided context does not specifically mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, it does emphasize the importance of using controlled vocabularies and metadata in the storage and management of data. Common data annotation techniques for deep learning include image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation.
