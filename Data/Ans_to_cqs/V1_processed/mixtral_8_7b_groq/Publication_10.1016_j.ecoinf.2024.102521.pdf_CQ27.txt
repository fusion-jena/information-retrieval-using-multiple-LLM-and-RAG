The process of deploying a trained deep learning model, as followed in the context provided, appears to involve model training using an interface and computational resources provided by a specific site, model serialization using the pickle file format, and model deployment on a platform that supports inference.

Firstly, the model training is carried out using the STARdbi\_train tool, which takes the output directory of STARdbi\_split\_images as input and produces a classification model (ResNet152) in the form of a binary pickle file as output. The ResNet152 model is a deep residual network developed by He et al. (2015) that has been widely used for image classification tasks. The pickle file format is a popular choice for model serialization in Python, as it allows for the easy and efficient serialization of complex objects, including deep learning models.

Once the model has been trained and serialized, it can be deployed on a platform that supports inference. The context does not provide specific details about the platform used for deployment. However, it is mentioned that STARdbi will urge its users to make their data as open as possible, suggesting that the platform used for deployment may support data sharing and collaboration.

In addition, the context provides references to several papers that have used deep learning for computer vision tasks in ecology, such as estimating arthropod abundance, biomass, and diversity (Zhuang et al., 2022), and advancing ecological research on arthropods through computer vision (Schneider et al., 2023). These papers demonstrate the potential of deep learning for ecological research and suggest that the platform used for deployment may support a range of computer vision tasks.

Overall, the process of deploying a trained deep learning model in the context provided involves model training using an interface and computational resources provided by a specific site, model serialization using the pickle file format, and model deployment on a platform that supports inference. While the context does not provide specific details about the platform used for deployment, it suggests that the platform may support data sharing and collaboration and a range of computer vision tasks.
