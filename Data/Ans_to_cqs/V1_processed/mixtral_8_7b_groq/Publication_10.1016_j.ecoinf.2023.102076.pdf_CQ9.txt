The text provided does not give information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses a text classification pipeline designed to handle imbalanced datasets and large training datasets, using a hierarchical classification approach. The pipeline is demonstrated using an example data collection scenario, but the specific data repository or dataset used is not mentioned.

The pipeline is applied to the task of classifying text related to the exploitation or sale of a particular taxa, using social media posts and web articles as the data source. The authors suggest that the models and pipeline could be applied to other forms of textual data, such as listings from E-commerce platforms.

The paper also cites several related works, including SciBERT, a pretrained language model for scientific text, and a study on hunting-induced mammal defaunation in the tropics. However, none of these works provide information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline in question.

Therefore, I am unable to provide the location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline discussed in the text.
