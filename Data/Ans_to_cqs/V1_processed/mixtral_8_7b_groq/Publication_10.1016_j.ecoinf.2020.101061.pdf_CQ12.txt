The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the context that discusses the use of the Tesla K80 GPU for training the model, and the normalization of RGB channels to align with ImageNet pretraining weights. ImageNet is a large-scale image recognition dataset that is commonly used for training CNNs. Additionally, the context mentions the use of data augmentation techniques such as random flips and translations, which are commonly used in training CNNs. There is no mention of other types of deep learning models such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers in the provided context.
