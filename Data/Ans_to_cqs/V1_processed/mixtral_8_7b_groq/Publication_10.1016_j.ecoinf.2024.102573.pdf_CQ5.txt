The context provided does not give specific information about the datasets used in the bird species recognition deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions various works and studies related to this field, such as those by Stowell (2022), Xie et al. (2023), Kahl et al. (2021), Tang et al. (2023), Zsebok et al. (2019), and Xie and Zhu (2019). These studies might have used different datasets for their research.

In the given experiment, the focus is on introducing learnable frontends (LEAF-P and SincNet-P) for audio processing, and it uses an official EfficientNet-B0 implementation from TorchVision for the backend neural network classifier. The context does not mention any specific dataset used in this experiment.

Commonly used datasets in computer vision and audio processing include MNIST for handwritten digit recognition, CIFAR for object recognition, and ImageNet for large-scale image classification. However, without explicit information in the provided context, it is impossible to determine which datasets were used in the bird species recognition deep learning pipeline.
