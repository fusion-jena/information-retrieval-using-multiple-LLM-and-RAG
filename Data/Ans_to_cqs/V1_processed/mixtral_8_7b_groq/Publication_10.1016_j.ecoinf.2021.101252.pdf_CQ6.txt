The provided context discusses various aspects of deep learning models, but it does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, based on general practices in the field of machine learning and deep learning, I can provide some common preprocessing steps.

Before training a deep learning model, data preprocessing is an essential step to enhance the model's performance and ensure better learning from the input data. Some common preprocessing techniques include:

1. Data cleaning: This step involves handling missing or corrupted data points. Techniques such as imputation, where missing values are replaced with statistical measures (e.g., mean, median, or mode), or simply removing the rows or columns with missing data can be applied.

2. Normalization and Scaling: Deep learning models, especially neural networks, are sensitive to the scale of input features. Thus, it is crucial to normalize or scale the data. Common techniques include min-max scaling, where features are scaled between 0 and 1, or z-score normalization, where features are scaled using their mean and standard deviation.

3. Feature engineering: This step involves creating new features from the existing data to improve model performance. Techniques such as one-hot encoding, binning, or polynomial feature generation can be applied.

4. Data splitting: The dataset is typically divided into training, validation, and testing sets. This allows for training the model on one portion of the data, tuning hyperparameters using another portion, and evaluating the final model's performance on unseen data.

5. Augmentation (for time-series or image data): For sequential or image data, techniques such as time-series cross-validation, windowing, or data augmentation (e.g., rotation, scaling, or flipping for images) can be applied to increase the size of the dataset and improve model generalization.

While the provided context does not mention these specific preprocessing steps, it does discuss AutoML, which is an automated process for selecting models and hyperparameters. Preprocessing steps can be incorporated into the AutoML pipeline to ensure the best possible performance.

In summary, common preprocessing steps before training a deep learning model include data cleaning, normalization/scaling, feature engineering, data splitting, and augmentation (for time-series or image data).
