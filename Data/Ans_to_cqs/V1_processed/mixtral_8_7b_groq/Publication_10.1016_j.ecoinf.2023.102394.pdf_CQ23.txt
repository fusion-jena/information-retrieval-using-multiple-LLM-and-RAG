Based on the provided context, the study does not explicitly mention the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does provide some information that suggests that certain steps may have been taken.

Firstly, the study retrieved a set of 2207 Soil Organic Carbon Stocks (SOCS) data from a database, which were organized by depth and covered the period from 2010 to 2014. Although the context does not explicitly state whether this dataset is diverse, it can be inferred that the data covers various locations and time periods, which could contribute to the model's generalizability.

Secondly, the study used a deep learning algorithm, specifically a multilayer perceptron (MLP), to model the relationship between SOCS and environmental covariates. MLPs are a type of feedforward artificial neural network that can learn complex patterns and relationships in data. The study does not mention whether cross-validation or stratified splitting were used, but MLPs can be trained using these techniques to improve their generalizability.

Lastly, the study used a general predictive function to model the relationship between SOCS and environmental covariates, which includes topography (R), parent material (PM), soil variables (S), climate (C), and biota (B). The use of a general predictive function suggests that the study considered multiple factors that could affect SOCS, which could improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly state the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, it suggests that the study may have used a diverse dataset, cross-validation or stratified splitting, and a general predictive function to improve the model's ability to generalize to new data. However, further information is needed to confirm these measures.
