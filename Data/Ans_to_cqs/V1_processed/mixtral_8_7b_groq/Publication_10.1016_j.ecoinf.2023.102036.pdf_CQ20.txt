Based on the provided context, the deep learning model was trained on an Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9900K CPU @ 3.60GHz processor and 32GB RAM memory. However, it does not explicitly mention the use of specialized hardware resources such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) for training the model.

The use of CPUs for training deep learning models is common for smaller-scale projects or when GPUs or TPUs are not available. However, for larger-scale deep learning projects, CPUs can be quite slow, and the use of GPUs or TPUs is highly recommended due to their ability to perform parallel computations, which significantly speeds up the training process.

Therefore, while the context suggests that the deep learning model was trained on a CPU, it is possible that specialized hardware resources such as GPUs or TPUs were used but not mentioned in the provided information.
