The provided context discusses the training, testing, and evaluation of deep learning models for snow leopard identification, as well as the funding and data availability for the study. However, it does not explicitly describe the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.

However, based on common practices in deep learning model deployment and the context's mention of a Microsoft Sponsorship for Azure-based development, it can be inferred that the following process was likely followed:

1. Model serialization: Once the deep learning model was trained and tested, it was saved in a serialized format, such as a .h5 file for models built using Keras. This allowed for the model to be easily loaded and used in a variety of platforms.
2. Platform selection: Given the mention of Azure-based development, it is likely that the trained deep learning model was deployed on Microsoft's Azure cloud platform. Azure offers a variety of services for deep learning model deployment, such as Azure Machine Learning and Azure Kubernetes Service.
3. Model loading and deployment: The serialized model was loaded onto the Azure platform and integrated with the necessary APIs and user interfaces for the snow leopard identification system.
4. Testing and validation: After deployment, the model was likely tested and validated to ensure that it was functioning as expected and providing accurate snow leopard identifications.

It is important to note that this answer is based on inferences drawn from the provided context and common practices in deep learning model deployment. The exact process followed may differ from the one described here.
