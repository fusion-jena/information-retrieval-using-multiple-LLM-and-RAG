The provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the data used in the study comes from a training dataset, which was divided into folds for model construction, internal cross-validation, and external evaluation. 

The raw data could have been collected through various methods such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. For instance, presence data could have been collected through field surveys or extracted from existing databases, while background points could have been obtained from publicly available datasets or generated using sensors. 

To ensure the independence of data within and outside of spatial blocks, the study used a spatial blocking technique, dividing the study area into 25 equally sized blocks using the blockCV package in R. This approach aims to minimize spatial autocorrelation within blocks and maximize it between blocks. 

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data, it is likely that a combination of data collection techniques was employed, including surveys, sensors, and public datasets. The spatial blocking technique used in the study suggests an effort to control for spatial autocorrelation, which could be present in data collected through various methods.
