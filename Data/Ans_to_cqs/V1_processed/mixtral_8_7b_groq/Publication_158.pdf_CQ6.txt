The provided context discusses several preprocessing steps that were taken before training a deep learning model for image analysis.

First, data augmentation was applied to enhance sample variation. This included techniques such as rotation, reflection bias of ±10%, and random noise of ±10% reflection for 15% of the input image. Data augmentation is a common preprocessing step in deep learning, particularly for image data, as it can help increase the size and diversity of the training set, improve model performance, and reduce overfitting.

Second, the input image size was varied to account for objects represented as a single pixel up to larger assemblages extending beyond the 32 by 32 pixel input image. Specifically, the input image was cropped to sizes of 1 × 1, 4 × 4, and 8 × 8 in addition to the original input of 32 × 32. This approach was taken because standard deep learning CNN architectures, such as ResNet and Inception, did not perform well due to the range of image object sizes encountered.

Third, different pooling methods were used for the ensemble of models. Max pooling was used for two models in the ensemble and average pooling for one. This was done because initial tests showed that both provided improvement in some cases and thus could enhance the model's performance.

Fourth, batch normalization was applied after all convolution or dense layers, except for the final output. Batch normalization is a technique that standardizes and normalizes the inputs to a layer during training, which can help improve the speed, performance, and stability of the training process.

Lastly, other preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the network weights with the best performance were kept, which implies that some form of evaluation and selection of the training data may have been performed.

In summary, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model in the provided context include data augmentation, varying input image sizes, using different pooling methods, batch normalization, and potentially some form of data evaluation and selection.
