The provided context does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It is possible that the model was trained using a Central Processing Unit (CPU), a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), a Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), or a combination of these. The choice of hardware would depend on various factors such as the size and complexity of the model, the amount of data, and the available resources. However, the use of TensorFlow, mentioned in reference [Abadi et al., 2015], suggests that GPU or TPU could have been used, as TensorFlow supports both.
