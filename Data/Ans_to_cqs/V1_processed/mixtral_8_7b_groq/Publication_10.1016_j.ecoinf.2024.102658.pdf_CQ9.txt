The data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the research conducted by Noda et al. is available on GitHub. The specific URL for the repository is <https://github.com/RyokoNod/sdm-asian-elephants>. This repository contains the data and codes created in the research, which includes the amount of data, distribution data for machine learning models, and physiological data for process-based models.

The researchers note that collecting data for both types of models is difficult and costly, which poses a bottleneck for building Species Distribution Models (SDMs) for practical use. However, they have made the data and codes available for others to use and build upon.

It is important to note that while the data and codes are available on GitHub, there is no mention of the data being available on other repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, if one is looking for the data specifically on those repositories, they may not find it.

Additionally, the researchers have provided an interactive map available at <https://miro.mindnode.com/app/board/uXjVOX_Zhf8=/?share_link_id=937959545296> for informally exploring all outputs of the models.

In summary, the data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the research conducted by Noda et al. is available on GitHub at <https://github.com/RyokoNod/sdm-asian-elephants>. However, it is not available on other repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
