The provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the comparison of various algorithms and their performance on the URPC 2020 dataset, as well as the introduction of the UODN algorithm for underwater object detection. However, there is no mention of the code repository where the pipeline can be found. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
