The provided context does not include specific information on data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention several studies that use deep learning approaches for various applications such as streamflow forecasting, short-term wind forecasting, and rainfall-runoff models.

In general, data augmentation techniques are used to increase the amount of training data and improve the robustness of deep learning models. Some common data augmentation techniques for images include flipping, rotating, scaling, and cropping. These techniques can help the model generalize better and reduce overfitting.

For time series data, such as those used in the studies mentioned in the context, data augmentation techniques can include time-series specific methods such as time warping, jittering, and adding noise. Time warping involves changing the time scale of the time series, jittering adds random noise to the time axis, and adding noise involves adding random noise to the values of the time series.

In the study by Dehghani et al. (2023), they used deep learning approaches such as LSTM, CNN, and ConvLSTM for hourly short-term streamflow forecasting. However, they do not mention any data augmentation techniques used in their study.

Similarly, in the study by Feng et al. (2017), they used a data-driven multi-model methodology with deep feature selection for short-term wind forecasting. However, they do not mention any data augmentation techniques used in their study.

In the study by Chadalawada et al. (2017), they used a genetic programming approach to system identification of rainfall-runoff models. However, they do not mention any data augmentation techniques used in their study.

Therefore, while data augmentation techniques are commonly used in deep learning pipelines, the provided context does not contain specific information on the data augmentation techniques used in the studies mentioned.
