Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline uses CSV data format. The data consists of past values of air quality (AQ) measurements from two legal stations in Modena, an Italian city. The data is preprocessed using a MinMaxScaler that transforms each feature to a [0-1] range. Additionally, the temporal window of the dataset is reshaped such that each observation consists of a specific number of previous observations (x) as rows and the number of features (y) as columns. This preprocessed data is then used to train the LSTM model. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning pipeline in this particular context uses CSV data format.
