The provided context does not directly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does discuss the use of different techniques to improve results in image classification tasks, which can be related to the management of randomness in deep learning.

One of the strategies mentioned in the context is data augmentation, which can help reduce overfitting and increase the robustness of the model by creating new training samples through random transformations of the original images, such as small changes in brightness and zoom. This can introduce a certain level of randomness during the training process, helping the model generalize better to unseen data.

Another technique mentioned is the use of a custom loss function instead of the standard binary cross-entropy loss. This change can lead to better results by altering the optimization process and influencing how the model learns from the training data. This can be seen as another way of controlling randomness, as it modifies the learning dynamics of the model.

Lastly, the context discusses the use of different network architectures, such as U-Net and SE-ResNet-50, to achieve better results in image classification tasks. The choice of architecture can impact the model's performance and its ability to handle randomness during training.

While not explicitly mentioned, managing randomness through the use of a random seed value is a common practice in deep learning to ensure reproducibility of results. By setting a fixed seed value, researchers can control the randomness in various parts of the deep learning pipeline, such as weight initialization, data shuffling, and dropout regularization. This helps ensure consistent results across multiple runs and facilitates fair comparisons between different models and techniques.

In summary, although the provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does mention techniques that can influence the level of randomness during training, such as data augmentation, custom loss functions, and network architecture choices. Additionally, managing randomness using a fixed random seed value is a common practice in deep learning for ensuring reproducibility.
