The text provided discusses the use of deep learning methods for classification in entomology, specifically for identifying insects at various taxonomic levels. However, it does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, we can infer that bounding box annotation was used in the training dataset.

The text mentions that bounding boxes in the training dataset are within a certain size and provides examples of full resolution and cropped images of insects. Cropping or drawing bounding boxes around objects is a common data annotation technique used in deep learning to identify and locate objects within an image. This technique is often used in object detection tasks, where the goal is to identify and locate objects within an image.

The text does not mention other data annotation techniques such as instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, or landmark annotation. However, it is possible that these techniques were also used in the deep learning pipeline, but the text does not provide enough information to confirm this.

In summary, based on the provided text, we can infer that bounding box annotation was used in the training dataset for a deep learning pipeline for insect classification. However, the text does not provide enough information to confirm the use of other data annotation techniques.
