Based on the information provided, there is no direct mention of the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The text only briefly discusses the use of an artificial neural network (ANN) as one of the models considered in a study. However, it does not specify which framework was used to implement the ANN.

There are several popular frameworks available for building deep learning models, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and others. TensorFlow is an open-source library developed by Google Brain Team, while PyTorch is a machine learning library based on the Torch library and primarily developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. Keras is another popular high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano.

Given the publication year of the sources (earliest one is from 2002), it is possible that the study used an ANN implementation in a language like R or Python, without relying on a specialized deep learning framework. However, without more specific information, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer.

In summary, the provided context does not contain enough information to determine which frameworks were used to build the deep learning model.
