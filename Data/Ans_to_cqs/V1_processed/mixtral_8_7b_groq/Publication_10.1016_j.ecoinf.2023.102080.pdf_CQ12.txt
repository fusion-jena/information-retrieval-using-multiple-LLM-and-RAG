The provided context does not mention any type of deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers being used in the pipeline. The pipeline described in the context involves covariate selection procedures for model fitting, using GLM with elastic-net regularization, GAM with null-space penalization, and Random Forest algorithms.

The first step in the pipeline is collinearity filtering (Step A), where a collinearity filtering algorithm is applied to identify and remove collinear covariates. The second step is model-specific embedding (Step B), where covariates selected after Step A are used to fit models with embedded selection procedures.

The models used in the pipeline are GLM with elastic-net regularization, GAM with null-space penalization, and Random Forest algorithms, which are not deep learning models. Therefore, the answer to the query is that no deep learning models are used in the pipeline.
