Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that the study focuses on the performance of a model for classifying pixels in remote sensing images, and it evaluates the model using metrics like R-squared (R2) and Normalized Segment Length (NSL).

The study finds that the R2 value is generally above 0.4, and it has a peak value around 0.47 for a certain number of pixels (L = 425). For the "Other Plants" class, the best results are obtained using the NSL metric. However, the root cause of this effect is not clear, and the result needs to be confirmed due to the small number of data points (33 points) in this class.

Given this information, it can be inferred that the training of the model might be complete when the performance metrics, such as R2 or NSL, reach a plateau or a peak value, indicating that the model's predictions are not improving significantly. However, this is an indirect inference based on the evaluation of the model's performance, and the specific training completion criteria are not provided in the context.
