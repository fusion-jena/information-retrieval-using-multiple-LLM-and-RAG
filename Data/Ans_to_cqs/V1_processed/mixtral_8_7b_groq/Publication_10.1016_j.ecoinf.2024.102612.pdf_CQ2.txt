Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline utilizes multi-spectral (MS) geoinformation data, specifically MS imagery and LiDAR point clouds, for fuel type classification. Therefore, the data formats used in this pipeline are likely to be raster images for MS imagery and point clouds for LiDAR data.

MS imagery is a type of remote sensing data that captures reflected light from multiple spectral bands. These bands can be combined into a single multi-layer image, making it suitable for input into deep learning models. Raster image formats, such as GeoTIFF or JPEG, are commonly used for storing and processing MS imagery.

LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data, on the other hand, captures detailed 3D information about the Earth's surface. LiDAR data is often represented as a point cloud, where each point has an X, Y, and Z coordinate, as well as additional attributes such as intensity or return number. Point cloud data can be stored in various formats, such as LAS or LAZ, which are specifically designed for LiDAR data.

The context also mentions the use of Sentinel-2 MS imagery, which suggests that the data is sourced from a satellite-based remote sensing system. Sentinel-2 provides global coverage and high-resolution MS imagery, making it a popular choice for land cover and fuel type classification tasks.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline for fuel type classification using MS geoinformation data primarily uses raster image formats for MS imagery and point cloud formats for LiDAR data.
