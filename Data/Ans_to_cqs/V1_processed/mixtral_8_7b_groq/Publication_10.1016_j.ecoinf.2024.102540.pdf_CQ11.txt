I'm sorry for any inconvenience, but the provided context does not include information about the data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the use of deep learning techniques, specifically the YOLOv5 model, for detecting alates on sorghum leaves. It also mentions the dataset splitting ratio and the training of multiple versions of the YOLOv5 model. However, it does not provide a link to the data repository for this pipeline. For more information on this, you may need to refer to the original research source.
