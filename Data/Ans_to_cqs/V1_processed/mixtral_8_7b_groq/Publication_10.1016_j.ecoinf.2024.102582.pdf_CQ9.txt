Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the research. However, it is mentioned that the research utilized the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to retrieve atmospherically corrected Landsat Surface Reflectance products. The GEE platform is a cloud-based geoprocessing platform that offers a multi-petabyte catalog of satellite imagery and other geospatial data.

Moreover, the context indicates that the research was based on large-scale land cover dynamic monitoring using the GEE cloud platform for mangrove extraction in coastal zones. However, it does not specify whether the data and code for the deep learning pipeline are publicly available in any data repository like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.

Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query without additional information.
