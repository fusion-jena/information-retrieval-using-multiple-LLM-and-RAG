The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific cloud platform used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform was used to assess machine learning algorithms for mapping soil salinity. It is important to note that GEE is a geospatial analysis platform, not a general-purpose cloud computing platform like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform.

The deep learning model in question is a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model, which is a type of model commonly deployed on general-purpose cloud computing platforms. However, the context does not provide enough information to determine whether a general-purpose cloud computing platform was used in this specific case.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to definitively answer the query regarding which cloud platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
