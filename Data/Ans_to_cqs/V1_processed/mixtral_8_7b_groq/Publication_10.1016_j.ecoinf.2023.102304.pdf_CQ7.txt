Based on the provided context, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training is not explicitly stated. However, it is mentioned that Runge et al. (2022) optimized the Land-Temperature-Response (LTR) algorithm for fitting a disturbance-recovery pattern in time series data. The optimization involved adjusting the maximum number of segments (MS) used for fitting and the threshold for fast recovery events (RT).

In the context of the LTR algorithm, MS and RT are important parameters that can affect the accuracy and kappa of the model's predictions. An MS value of 4 is appropriate for a simple disturbance-recovery pattern, while more segments may be required for a complex recovery situation. A higher RT value makes the model less likely to miss a fast recovery but more likely to cause a false positive error.

Therefore, when splitting the data for deep learning model training, it may be useful to consider the complexity of the disturbance-recovery pattern in the data and the potential impact of fast recovery events. One approach could be to split the data into training, validation, and testing sets based on the temporal pattern, ensuring that each set contains a representative sample of stable, decreasing, recovering, and stable phases. Additionally, it may be useful to adjust the MS and RT parameters during the training process to optimize the model's performance.

However, it is important to note that the specific criteria for splitting the data may depend on the characteristics of the data and the research question at hand. Therefore, it is recommended to consult relevant literature and experts in the field when determining the appropriate criteria for splitting the data in a deep learning model training context.
