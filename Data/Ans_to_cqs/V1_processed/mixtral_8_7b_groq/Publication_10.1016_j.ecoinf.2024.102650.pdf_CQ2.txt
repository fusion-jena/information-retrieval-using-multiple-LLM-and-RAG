The provided context does not give specific information about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the study involves processing text data from tweets. It is likely that the text data is in the form of CSV files, where each row represents a tweet and columns contain various attributes such as the text of the tweet, time of posting, location, and other metadata.

The context also discusses the use of natural language processing techniques such as text filtering, Chinese text segmentation, and word segmentation. These techniques are typically applied to text data in order to preprocess it for use in a deep learning model.

In addition, the context mentions the use of the ERNIE model, which is a type of deep learning model that is specifically designed for natural language processing tasks. ERNIE is a model that learns semantic relationships and word order features from massive amounts of data, and it has been shown to perform well on various Chinese NLP tasks.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly state the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that the study involves processing text data in the form of CSV files, and using deep learning models such as ERNIE for natural language processing tasks.
