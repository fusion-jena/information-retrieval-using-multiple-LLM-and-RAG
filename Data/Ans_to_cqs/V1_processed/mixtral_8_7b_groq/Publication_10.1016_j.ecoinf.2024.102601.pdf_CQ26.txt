The provided context discusses the use of machine learning (ML), particularly Random Forest (RF), in the analysis of Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery for wildfire management. It also mentions the integration of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, such as SHAP-FSS, for optimizing data structures. However, it does not directly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline.

In ML and deep learning, data bias can occur due to various reasons, such as an imbalanced dataset, poor data quality, or non-representative sampling. To address these issues, several techniques can be employed during the preprocessing stage:

1. **Stratified splitting**: This technique ensures that the train and test datasets maintain the same proportion of samples for each class as the original dataset. This is particularly useful when dealing with imbalanced classes.

2. **Resampling techniques**: These methods include oversampling and undersampling. Oversampling replicates samples from the minority class to balance the dataset, while undersampling reduces the number of samples from the majority class. A more advanced approach is the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), which generates synthetic samples for the minority class based on existing data.

3. **Diverse data collection**: Collecting data from various sources, locations, and conditions can help ensure that the dataset is representative and less prone to bias. This can be particularly important in remote sensing applications, where data can be influenced by factors such as sensor type, weather conditions, and time of day.

4. **Data augmentation**: This technique generates new samples by applying transformations (e.g., rotation, scaling, flipping) to the existing dataset. This can help improve model performance and reduce bias by increasing the diversity of the training data.

5. **Feature engineering**: This process involves creating new features from existing ones, which can help improve model performance and reduce bias. For example, combining multiple bands from S2 imagery can create new predictors that better capture the information relevant to wildfire management.

Although the provided context does not explicitly mention these techniques, they are commonly used in ML and deep learning pipelines to address data bias during preprocessing.
