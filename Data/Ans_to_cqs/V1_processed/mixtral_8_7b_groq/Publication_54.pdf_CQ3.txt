Based on the provided context, there are no specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses mainly on the experimental settings, the use of the Inception-ResNet-v2 model, and the transfer learning method applied to the endemic bird species dataset.

However, it can be inferred that some form of image annotation was used to label the bird species in the dataset. Common image annotation techniques for object detection and recognition include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing a rectangle around the object of interest in an image. The rectangle, or bounding box, contains the coordinates of the object's location, making it easy for deep learning models to identify and classify the object.

2. Instance segmentation: This method is more precise than bounding box annotation, as it involves creating a mask around each instance of an object in an image. This allows the model to learn the exact shape and appearance of the object, capturing more detailed information.

Given the complexity of the deep learning pipeline and the Inception-ResNet-v2 model used in the study, it is likely that instance segmentation was employed for a more accurate representation of the endemic bird species. However, the context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used.

In summary, while the provided context does not offer specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that some form of image annotation was applied. Based on the complexity of the study, instance segmentation is the most probable annotation technique used.
