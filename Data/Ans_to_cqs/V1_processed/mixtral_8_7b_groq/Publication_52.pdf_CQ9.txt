The provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The text describes a study that uses a multi-layered neural network model with the unsupervised GRELMA algorithm for marine species identification. However, it does not mention where the data used in this study is stored or how it can be accessed. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
