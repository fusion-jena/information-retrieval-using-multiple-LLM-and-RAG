Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context describes the metadata and data organization for a specific measurement, including the E-Field Log and the measurement position hierarchy. However, it does not include any details about model training or performance monitoring.

In a general machine learning or modeling context, monitoring model performance during training can be achieved through various strategies, such as:

1. Validation sets: Splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets. The validation set is used to evaluate the model's performance during training, helping to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.
2. Cross-validation: A technique where the data is divided into 'k' subsets, and the model is trained and evaluated 'k' times, each time using a different subset as the validation set. This method provides a more robust estimate of the model's performance.
3. Early stopping: A strategy that involves monitoring the model's performance on the validation set during training. If the performance stops improving or starts degrading, the training process is stopped early to prevent overfitting.
4. Learning curves: Plotting the model's performance (e.g., error or loss) on the training and validation sets as a function of the training set size. This visualization helps assess the model's bias-variance trade-off and identify underfitting or overfitting issues.
5. Regularization: Techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization that help prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages large model weights.

Without specific information related to the model training process in the provided context, it is not possible to determine which strategy or strategies are being used to monitor model performance during training.
