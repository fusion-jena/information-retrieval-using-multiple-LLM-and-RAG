Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, there are some relevant concepts discussed that can be related to addressing data bias.

One of the papers mentioned, "Learning from imbalanced data" by He and Garcia (2009), discusses techniques for handling imbalanced datasets, which can be a source of data bias. The authors propose using a cost-sensitive learning approach, where misclassification costs are adjusted according to the class distribution. This method can help reduce bias towards the majority class.

In addition, the paper "A survey on missing data in machine learning" by Emmanuel et al. (2021) discusses the impact of missing data on machine learning models. Missing data can also lead to bias and poor model performance. The authors suggest using various techniques to handle missing data, such as imputation, where missing values are replaced with estimated values based on other data points. This technique can help reduce bias caused by missing data.

Furthermore, the concept of "diverse data collection" is indirectly mentioned in the paper "A review of the main driving factors of forest fire ignition over Europe" by Ganteaume et al. (2013). The authors emphasize the importance of considering various factors that contribute to forest fires, such as weather conditions, vegetation, and human activities. By collecting data on these diverse factors, the model can better capture the complexity of the problem and reduce bias.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling, it does discuss related concepts such as cost-sensitive learning, imputation, and diverse data collection that can be used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
