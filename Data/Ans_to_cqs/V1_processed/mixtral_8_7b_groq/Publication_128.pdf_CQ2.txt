The data format used in the deep learning pipeline, as described in the provided context, is an image in Red Green Blue (RGB) format with a resolution of 224x224. The images are batch normalized before training. Other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV are not mentioned in the provided context.

The focus of the provided context is on plant identification and classification using deep learning methods. Specifically, it describes the data preparation and model training process for six deep learning methods applied to four public plant image datasets and a Camellia sasanqua Thunb. dataset.

The images used in the study are in RGB format, which is a common format for color images. The resolution of the images is 224x224, which is a common size for input images in deep learning models as it provides a good balance between computational efficiency and model performance.

Before training, the images are batch normalized, which is a common preprocessing step in deep learning. Batch normalization helps to reduce internal covariate shift, which can improve the training speed and generalization performance of deep learning models.

Other data formats, such as audio, video, or CSV, are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, it can be inferred that the deep learning pipeline described in the context is focused on image-based classification tasks.
