Based on the information provided, a fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) is used in the pipeline for fish biomass estimation. The specific type of neural network is mentioned in the title of the article "Fully automatic system for fish biomass estimation based on deep neural network" and is further supported by the use of principal component analysis (PCA) for explainability of the FCNN. Additionally, there are no mentions of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or Transformers in the given context. Therefore, it can be concluded that a FCNN is the type of deep learning model used in this pipeline.
