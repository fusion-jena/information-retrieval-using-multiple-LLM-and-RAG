The provided context discusses the methodology used for predicting species distributions, which relies on ensemble modeling with statistical models such as GLM, Max-Ent, RF, GBM, and MARS. However, it does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.

In general, when preparing data for deep learning models, several preprocessing steps are commonly applied, similar to other machine learning algorithms. These steps include:

1. Data cleaning: This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistent data entries.

2. Data normalization or scaling: Deep learning models, like other machine learning algorithms, can be sensitive to the scale of input features. Therefore, it is essential to normalize or scale the data. Common techniques include min-max scaling, z-score normalization, and decimal scaling.

3. Feature engineering: This process involves creating new features from existing ones to improve model performance. For example, polynomial features or interaction features can be created by combining two or more features.

4. Data splitting: The dataset is typically divided into training, validation, and testing sets to evaluate model performance and prevent overfitting.

5. Encoding categorical variables: Deep learning models require numerical input. Therefore, categorical variables must be encoded using techniques such as one-hot encoding or ordinal encoding.

Although the provided context does not mention these specific preprocessing steps, it does mention some data preparation techniques related to the ensemble modeling approach. These include:

1. Creating pseudo-absence points: These points are essential for model execution and provide a reference for areas unlikely to be inhabited by the target species.

2. Train-test split: The dataset is split into a 3:1 train-test split for model training.

3. Model evaluation: Model performance is evaluated using two widely recognized metrics, AUC and TSS.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, general preprocessing techniques include data cleaning, normalization or scaling, feature engineering, data splitting, and encoding categorical variables. The context does mention some data preparation techniques specific to the ensemble modeling approach, such as creating pseudo-absence points, train-test split, and model evaluation.
