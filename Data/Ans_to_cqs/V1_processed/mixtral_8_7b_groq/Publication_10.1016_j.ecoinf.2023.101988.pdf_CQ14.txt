The provided context does not contain information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. The text describes the results of a study that used linear mixed modeling to analyze the relationship between survey type, survey method, and species detection in different habitats. However, it does not provide details on the specific methods used for hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search, random search, or other techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
