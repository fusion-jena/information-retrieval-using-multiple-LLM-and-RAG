While the provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does provide information about how randomness is addressed in the creation of a biased dataset and an unbiased dataset for plant species identification.

In the creation of the biased dataset, randomness is employed to distribute the data into training and testing sets. Specifically, 70% of the data is randomly chosen for the training set and 30% for the testing set. However, due to varying numbers of photos per species, the actual distribution might not be exactly 70%-30%. This approach is similar to what has been followed in many previous plant identification studies.

On the other hand, the unbiased dataset creation strategy aims to avoid the same-specimen-same-photo-bias (SSPB) by placing images from the same specimen in either the training dataset or the testing dataset. This restriction makes it harder to approximate the ideal 70%-30% distribution, both at the species level and globally.

These strategies show that randomness is indeed considered in the dataset creation process. However, the context does not provide information on other aspects of the deep learning pipeline, such as randomness in initializing weights, dropout, or data augmentation.

In general, deep learning pipelines use randomness to improve model performance and prevent overfitting. For instance, random initialization of weights is a common practice. Dropout, a regularization technique, randomly drops out neurons during training to prevent over-dependence on any one neuron. Data augmentation, which creates new training examples by applying random transformations to the original data, is another strategy that introduces randomness.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not directly answer the query, it does show that randomness is considered in dataset creation for plant species identification. Additionally, it is common practice in deep learning pipelines to use randomness in various aspects, such as weight initialization, dropout, and data augmentation, to improve model performance and prevent overfitting.
