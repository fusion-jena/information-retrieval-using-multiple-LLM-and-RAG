I regret to inform you that the code repository for the deep learning pipeline is not mentioned or provided in the given context. The text describes the methodology and process of creating a deep learning model for pollen species identification using a multispectral imaging flow cytometry dataset. However, it does not include information about where the code for this pipeline is available, such as on GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.

The text does mention that the dataset consisted of 426,876 images, which were split into training, validation, and testing sets. It also explains how the training set was augmented using various image transformations. Furthermore, it provides details about the network architecture, batch size, learning rate, and learning rate decay. However, the code implementing this pipeline is not discussed or referenced.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific location for the code repository based on the given context. I recommend contacting the authors or researchers who conducted the study for more information about the code implementation.
