The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the context provided, which mentions the use of ResNet50 and EfficientNetB3 models, both of which are CNN architectures. Furthermore, the pipeline involves the use of a CNN as the first part of the architecture, which is given an input image and transforms it into a root representation. This root representation is then non-linearly transformed into level outputs using fully connected (FC) layers and an activation function. The use of convolutional layers, FC layers, and activation functions all point to the use of a CNN in the pipeline.

Moreover, the context also mentions the use of a multitask CNN for hierarchical classification, further confirming the use of a CNN in the pipeline. The authors simplified the network architecture and hierarchical dependency loss proposed by Gao (2020) and rewrote the code from Ugenteraan (2020), both of which involve the use of a CNN for hierarchical classification.

Finally, the use of pre-trained weights from ImageNet also suggests the use of a CNN, as ImageNet is a large-scale image recognition dataset that is commonly used to train CNNs.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
