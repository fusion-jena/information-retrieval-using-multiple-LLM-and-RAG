The provided context does not directly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss transfer learning, which can be used to mitigate the effects of bias in the data.

In the context, transfer learning is discussed as a technique for improving the accuracy of deep learning models when there is a limited amount of training data. Specifically, it involves reusing previously attained knowledge in similar tasks. This can help to reduce overfitting, which is a common problem when training deep learning models on small datasets.

While transfer learning does not directly address data bias during preprocessing, it can help to mitigate the effects of bias in the data by allowing the model to learn from a larger and more diverse dataset. By using a pre-trained model that has been trained on a large and diverse dataset, such as ImageNet, the model can learn features that are more generalizable and less prone to bias.

In addition, the context discusses the use of feature extraction as a technique for transfer learning. In feature extraction, the intermediate layer of a pre-trained model is used as a feature extractor for a new task. This allows the model to leverage the pre-trained features, which have been learned from a large and diverse dataset, and apply them to a new task.

While the context does not explicitly mention other preprocessing techniques for addressing data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, these techniques can be used in conjunction with transfer learning to further mitigate the effects of bias in the data.

For example, stratified splitting can be used to ensure that the training and test sets have a similar distribution of classes, which can help to prevent bias in the training data from affecting the model's performance on the test data. Oversampling and undersampling can be used to balance the class distribution in the training data, which can help to prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class. Diverse data collection can be used to ensure that the training data is representative of the population, which can help to prevent bias in the model's predictions.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, it does discuss transfer learning as a technique for improving the accuracy of deep learning models on small and biased datasets. Transfer learning can be used in conjunction with other preprocessing techniques, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, to further mitigate the effects of bias in the data.
