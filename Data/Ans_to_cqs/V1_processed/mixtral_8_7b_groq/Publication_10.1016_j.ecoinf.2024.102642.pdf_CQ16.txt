The pieces of context provided do not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, they do mention that an early stopping method was used during training to keep the model weights before the models overfitted. This method involves specifying a patience parameter, which is set to 10 epochs for all training phases in this study. The training process stops before the models overfit, possibly when the validation loss plateaus or starts to degrade. However, the exact criteria are not specified in the context.
