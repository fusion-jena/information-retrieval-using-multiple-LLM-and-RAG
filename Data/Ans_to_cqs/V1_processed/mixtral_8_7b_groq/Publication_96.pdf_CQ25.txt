The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is burned area mapping, specifically within the Cerrado biome in Brazil. The model is a Deep Neural Network (DNN), which is a learning algorithm based on an artificial neural network with multiple hidden layers. The DNN model uses hierarchical data processing, where the input data in each module results in an output that is an input for the next module, connected through weights and biases whose values were learned during the training of the network.

The deep learning model is used to differentiate spectral signatures of burned and unburned areas in the study area. The model is trained using spectral training samples of burned and non-burned areas collected for the entire study area, which are well distributed in space. After training, the model is used for prediction and assessment, achieving a high overall accuracy of 97%.

Therefore, the deep learning model in this study is used for the purpose of classification, specifically for classifying pixels in Landsat 8 satellite images as burned or non-burned areas within the Cerrado biome. The high accuracy achieved by the model demonstrates the potential of deep learning algorithms for remote sensing applications using large remote sensing datasets, requiring low time and labor demand.
