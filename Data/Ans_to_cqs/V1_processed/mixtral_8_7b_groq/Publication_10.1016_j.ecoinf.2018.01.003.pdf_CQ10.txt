I don't have access to the specific code repository for a deep learning pipeline as the context provided does not include any information about it. However, I can suggest some popular deep learning libraries and their respective code repositories that you can use to build a deep learning pipeline.

1. TensorFlow - An open-source library developed by Google Brain Team. It provides a comprehensive ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML-powered applications.
Repository: <https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow>
2. Keras - A high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It's user-friendly, modular, and extensible.
Repository: <https://github.com/keras-team/keras>
3. PyTorch - Developed by Facebook's AI Research lab, PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library based on the Torch library. It's used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing.
Repository: <https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch>
4. MXNet - A deep learning framework that allows you to define, train, and deploy deep neural networks on a wide array of devices, from cloud infrastructure to mobile devices.
Repository: <https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet>
5. Caffe - A deep learning framework made with expression, speed, and modularity in mind. It is developed by Berkeley AI Research (BAIR) and by community contributors.
Repository: <https://github.com/caffe/caffe>

These deep learning libraries have extensive documentation and community support, making it easier for you to build and customize your deep learning pipeline.
