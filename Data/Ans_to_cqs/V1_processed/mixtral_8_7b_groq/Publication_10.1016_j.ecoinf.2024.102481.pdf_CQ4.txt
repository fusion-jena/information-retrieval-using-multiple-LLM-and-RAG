The provided context does not include information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The text mainly discusses the application of machine learning methods, specifically Random Forests (RFs), in the analysis of Chilean hake data. It explains how RFs can be used for classifying maturity in other taxa and improving biological understanding in future or retrospective research. However, it does not mention any data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
