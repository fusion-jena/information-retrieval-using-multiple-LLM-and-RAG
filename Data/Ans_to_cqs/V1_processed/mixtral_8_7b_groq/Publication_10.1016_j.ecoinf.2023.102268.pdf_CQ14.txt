Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the SVM model were optimized. However, it is mentioned that for model selection and parameter optimization, 50% of the training data were held-out for validation. This suggests that some form of model validation or tuning was performed, but the specific method (such as grid search, random search, or another technique) is not specified. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
