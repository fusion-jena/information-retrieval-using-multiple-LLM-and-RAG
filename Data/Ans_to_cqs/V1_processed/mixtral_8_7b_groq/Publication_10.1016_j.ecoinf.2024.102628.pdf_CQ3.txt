The provided context does not give specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the deep learning models were applied to 2D LiDAR images for forest classification. Common annotation techniques for 2D images include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation.

Bounding box annotation involves drawing a box around the object of interest in the image. This technique is often used for object detection tasks, where the goal is to locate and classify objects within an image.

Semantic segmentation, on the other hand, involves labeling each pixel in an image with a class label. This technique is useful for image segmentation tasks, where the goal is to partition an image into multiple regions or segments, each corresponding to a different object or class.

Instance segmentation is a more advanced technique that combines object detection and semantic segmentation. It involves not only labeling each pixel in an image with a class label but also distinguishing between individual instances of the same class.

Given that the deep learning models were applied to 2D LiDAR images for forest classification, it is possible that one or more of these annotation techniques were used. However, the provided context does not contain sufficient information to make a definitive conclusion.
