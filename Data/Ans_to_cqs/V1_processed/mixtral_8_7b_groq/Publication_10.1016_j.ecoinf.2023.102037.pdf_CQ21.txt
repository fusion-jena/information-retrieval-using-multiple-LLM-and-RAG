Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrix calculation after the model training. However, it does mention the use of certain metrics for model performance validation.

After training the model, the authors validate its performance in a practice-oriented way by splitting the data on the sticky plate level. This means that the model is evaluated based on its ability to predict a class for any given object it detects on unseen sticky plate images, which emulates its intended use in real-world applications.

The authors use "Slicing Aided Hyper Inference" (SAHI) to apply the YOLOv5 model on a sticky plate image. However, the context does not provide details about how SAHI works or what additional postprocessing steps it might involve.

For model performance evaluation, the authors use a method that involves splitting the data into training, validation, and testing sets at the sticky plate level. This allows them to validate the model's performance by evaluating its ability to predict the correct class for objects on unseen sticky plate images. While this is not a traditional postprocessing step, it is a crucial part of the model validation process.

In summary, based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrix calculation after the model training. However, the authors do validate the model's performance using a specific data splitting method and by evaluating its ability to predict the correct class for objects on unseen sticky plate images.
