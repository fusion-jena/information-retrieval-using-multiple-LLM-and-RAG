The methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipelines mentioned in the provided contexts include the use of sensors, specifically Autonomous Recording Units (ARUs), and surveys.

In the study by He et al. (2016), the authors used a deep residual learning method for image recognition. However, they did not mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data.

The study by Kahl et al. (2021) developed a deep learning solution for avian diversity monitoring called BirdNET. They used ARUs to collect raw data in the form of audio recordings of bird vocalizations. These ARUs were deployed in various locations and recorded bird sounds for several minutes at a time.

The study by Leshem and Yom-Tov (1998) focused on the routes of migrating soaring birds. While they did not use deep learning methods, they collected raw data through surveys of bird observations. They recorded the species, direction, and altitude of soaring birds during migration periods.

The study by Lublin et al. (2023) investigated the history of highly-pathogenic avian influenza in Israel (H5-subtypes) from 2006 to 2023. They likely collected raw data through surveillance and monitoring programs for avian influenza in poultry farms and wild bird populations.

The study by Pekarsky et al. (2021) analyzed the gut microbiota of an omnivorous avian migrant exposed to artificial food supplementation. They collected raw data in the form of fecal samples from the birds, which were then used for microbiota analysis.

The study by Phillips et al. (2018) revealed the ecological content of long-duration audio-recordings of the environment through clustering and visualization. They used ARUs to collect raw data in the form of audio recordings of environmental sounds.

In summary, the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipelines mentioned in the provided contexts include the use of ARUs for audio recordings of bird vocalizations and environmental sounds, surveys for bird observations, and the collection of fecal samples for microbiota analysis.
