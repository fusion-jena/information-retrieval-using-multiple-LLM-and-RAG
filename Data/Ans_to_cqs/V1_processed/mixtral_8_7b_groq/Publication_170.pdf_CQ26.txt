The provided context does not contain specific information about techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of "newly-labeled images" and "extended training set" in the context of training a DCNN model for automatically identifying, counting, and describing wild animals in camera-trap images. It is possible that data augmentation techniques such as oversampling or undersampling were used to balance the training set. The context also mentions the use of an "adaptive deep learning method" which suggests that some techniques to address data bias or imbalance may have been employed. However, the specific methods used are not mentioned.

In general, techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline include:

* Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the data into subsets based on certain criteria (e.g., class labels) and then randomly sampling from these subsets to ensure that the training, validation, and test sets are representative of the overall data distribution.
* Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of examples in the minority class by replicating existing examples or generating new examples using techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
* Undersampling: This technique involves decreasing the number of examples in the majority class to balance the data. This can be done randomly or by using techniques such as Tomek links to remove noisy samples.
* Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from a variety of sources and ensuring that the data is representative of the population of interest. This can help to reduce bias and improve the generalizability of the model.

It is important to note that the context does not provide enough information to determine if any of these techniques were used in the study.
