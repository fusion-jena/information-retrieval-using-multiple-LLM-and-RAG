The provided context discusses the use of deep learning models for ecological applications, but it does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, there are some implicit strategies that can be inferred.

Deep learning models often involve randomness in various stages such as initialization of weights, data shuffling, and dropout regularization. Although the context does not mention the use of a specific seed value to control the randomness, it does mention the use of K-fold cross-validation. K-fold cross-validation is a technique used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models by dividing the dataset into 'k' subsets or folds, and training and evaluating the model 'k' times, each time using a different subset for testing and the remaining subsets for training. This technique can help in reducing the impact of randomness by providing a more robust estimate of the model's performance.

Moreover, the context mentions the use of a pre-trained model from TensorFlow model zoo, which suggests that the authors may have used a pre-trained model with weights that were randomly initialized during the pre-training phase. This can help in reducing the impact of randomness during the training of the deep learning model.

Furthermore, the context mentions the use of dropout regularization, which is a technique used to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping out a certain percentage of neurons during training. This technique can help in reducing the impact of randomness by introducing stochasticity during the training phase.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that the authors may have used techniques such as K-fold cross-validation, pre-trained weights, and dropout regularization to reduce the impact of randomness.
