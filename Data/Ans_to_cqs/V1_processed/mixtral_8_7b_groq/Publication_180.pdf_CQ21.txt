Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training for Chagas disease species identification using TensorFlow and deep learning. The text mainly focuses on the process of calibrating the model for Mexican and Brazilian species, specifically adjusting the number of training steps for optimal identification rates and processing times.

However, it is possible to infer some postprocessing steps that might have been employed, based on common practices in machine learning and image classification tasks:

1. Metrics calculation: After training the model, it is common to calculate various metrics to evaluate the performance of the model. These metrics could include overall identification rate, precision, recall, and F1-score. The context mentions an overall identification rate for both Mexican and Brazilian datasets, which suggests that such a calculation was part of the postprocessing steps.

2. Confusion matrix: A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model. It can provide insights into the types of errors the model is making, such as false positives and false negatives. Although not explicitly mentioned in the context, generating a confusion matrix would be a typical postprocessing step for this kind of image classification task.

3. Saliency maps: Saliency maps are a way to visualize the parts of an input image that are most important for a model's prediction. While the context does not mention saliency maps specifically, they can be a useful tool for understanding how a deep learning model is making its predictions. It is possible that saliency maps were generated as part of the postprocessing steps, but the text does not provide enough information to confirm this.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps taken after training the model for Chagas disease species identification, it is possible to infer that metrics calculation, confusion matrix generation, and saliency map visualization might have been part of the process.
