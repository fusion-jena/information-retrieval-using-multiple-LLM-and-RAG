Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The text discusses various topics related to urban areas, vegetation, land cover, and ecosystem services, but it does not mention any steps taken to validate a deep learning model.

However, some implicit evidence suggests that cross-validation might have been used. The Biswas et al. (2023) paper refers to a three-decade perspective on landscape fragmentation and ecosystem services, which could involve the use of time-series data. When working with time-series data, it is common to use techniques like cross-validation to assess the model's performance and avoid overfitting.

Additionally, the Bin Sulaiman (2023) paper is a systematic review of compact city meanings, which does not involve developing or validating a deep learning model. Similarly, the Bousquet et al. (2023) paper focuses on a critical review of multicriteria decision analysis practices in planning urban green spaces and nature-based solutions, without any reference to deep learning models.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, there is some implicit evidence suggesting that cross-validation might have been used. Nonetheless, without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
