The provided context does not give information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of various modeling approaches and techniques for training and testing machine learning models in a different context.

The methods described include the use of regression-based models such as Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), as well as machine learning models such as Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Maximum Entropy software (MaxEnt). The models were built using the biomod2 package in R.

The study used a spatial blocking technique to separate data into training and testing datasets, dividing the study area into 25 equally sized blocks and determining the size of the blocks using the spatialAutoRange function in the blockCV package. The blocks were then divided among five folds with roughly equal numbers of presences and background points.

The study also explored the impact of the number of background points used to train the models, finding that RF outperformed all the ensemble models but was more sensitive to the number of background points used.

However, the context does not provide information on the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
