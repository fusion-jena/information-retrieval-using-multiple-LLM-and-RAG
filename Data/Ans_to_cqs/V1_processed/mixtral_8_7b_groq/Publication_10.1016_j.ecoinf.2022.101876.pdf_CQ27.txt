Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the model was likely serialized, which is a common practice in machine learning to save the trained model into a file that can be reloaded later. This allows for the model to be used in different platforms or systems without having to retrain it every time.

Furthermore, it can be assumed that the researchers selected a platform to deploy the model based on the requirements of their project. The context suggests that the model was used for processing wildlife camera trap images, so the platform selection would have taken into account the computational resources needed for image processing and the need for accessibility in the field.

It is also worth noting that the researchers emphasize the importance of having well-labeled image sets to verify the accuracy of the model output and the level of scrutiny manual human reviewers put into identifying wildlife in images. Therefore, it is likely that the deployment process included measures to ensure the quality of the labeled data used for training and evaluating the model.

Overall, while the specific process of deploying the trained deep learning model is not provided in the context, it can be inferred that the researchers likely serialized the model and selected a platform based on their project requirements. Additionally, they likely took measures to ensure the quality of the labeled data used for training and evaluating the model.
