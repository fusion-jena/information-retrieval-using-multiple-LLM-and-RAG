While the provided context does not directly discuss deep learning models, it does mention preprocessing techniques such as scaling in the context of other machine learning algorithms, specifically bootstrapping and generalized linear models (GLMs).

Bootstrapping is a resampling technique that involves randomly sampling training data with replacement, which can increase models' precision by providing a combination of models that reduces stochastic errors in estimation. This technique can be used to create multiple subsets of the training data, which can then be scaled and used to train the model. Scaling is the process of transforming the range of features to have a similar scale, which can help improve the performance of machine learning algorithms.

In addition, the context also mentions a paper from the same group that explored the effects of the spatial pattern and shape of the environmental manifold on the performance of GLMs and RFs. This suggests that preprocessing steps such as cleaning and normalization may also be important in preparing the data for machine learning models. Cleaning the data can involve removing or correcting errors, outliers, or missing values, while normalization is the process of transforming the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

Therefore, based on the provided context, preprocessing steps that may be involved before training a deep learning model include scaling, cleaning, and normalization. However, it is important to note that the specific preprocessing steps required may depend on the characteristics of the data and the deep learning algorithm being used.
