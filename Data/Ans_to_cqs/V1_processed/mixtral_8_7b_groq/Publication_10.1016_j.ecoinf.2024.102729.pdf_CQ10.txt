I'm sorry for any confusion, but the provided context does not include information about a deep learning pipeline or its code repository link. The context consists of various research papers and resources related to environmental pollution, water quality management, and remote sensing. While some of these papers use machine learning techniques, such as Random Forest and Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC) analysis, none of them mention a deep learning pipeline or its code repository link.

If you have any other questions related to the provided context or a different topic, please let me know, and I will do my best to help you.
