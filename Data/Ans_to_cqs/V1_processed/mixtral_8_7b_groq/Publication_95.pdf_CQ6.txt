The provided context describes several preprocessing steps taken before training a deep learning model. These steps include data splitting, image augmentation, balancing the training set, and adjusting the final classification layer. While some of these steps are specific to training a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification, others can be generalized to preprocessing for other deep learning models.

First, the data is split into a training set, a validation set, and a test set. This is an essential step for any deep learning model, as it ensures that the model is evaluated on unseen data and prevents overfitting. In the context of image classification, it is crucial to ensure that the samples in each set are independent and have similar class distributions.

Next, the images undergo a three-step data augmentation procedure during training. Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the size of the training set by applying random transformations to the images, such as horizontal flipping, scaling contrast, and random cropping. This helps improve the model's ability to generalize and reduces overfitting.

The training set is then balanced by upsampling the images from the underrepresented classes through repetition to match the number of images of the most represented class. Balancing the training set is an important step in addressing class imbalance, which can negatively impact the model's performance.

Before training the networks, the final classification layer is adapted to match the seven classes. The input image size is also considered, as it can affect the processing time and classification accuracy. Therefore, the network models are trained on five different image sizes.

In summary, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, as described in the provided context, include data splitting, image augmentation, balancing the training set, and adjusting the final classification layer. While some of these steps are specific to training a CNN for image classification, data splitting and balancing the training set are essential steps for any deep learning model.
