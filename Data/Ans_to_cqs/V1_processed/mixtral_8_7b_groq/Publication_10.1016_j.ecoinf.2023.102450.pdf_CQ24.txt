The provided context includes several research papers that use deep learning techniques for various applications, but it does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer that one common method to handle randomness is through the use of a random seed value.

In deep learning, randomness can be introduced in various stages of the pipeline, such as initializing weights, data shuffling, and dropout regularization. Using a fixed random seed value ensures that the same randomness is introduced in every run, making the training process reproducible.

For instance, in the paper by Clune et al. (2018), the authors use deep learning to automatically identify, count, and describe wild animals in camera-trap images. Although they do not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value, it is likely that they used one to ensure the reproducibility of their results.

Similarly, in the paper by Okafor et al. (2016), the authors compare deep learning with bag of visual words for wild-animal recognition. They do not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value, but it is a common practice in deep learning to use a fixed random seed value for reproducibility.

In the paper by Schindler and Steinhage (2021), the authors use deep learning to identify animals and recognize their matching score and cross-correlation feature map of the classification branch. Although they do not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value, they do mention that they use a pre-trained model, which suggests that they may have used a fixed random seed value during the pre-training stage to ensure reproducibility.

Furthermore, in the paper by Sch√ºtz et al. (2021), the authors use YOLOv4 for detection and motion monitoring of red foxes. The YOLOv4 architecture includes various sources of randomness, such as anchor box initialization and data augmentation. Although the paper does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value, it is a common practice to use a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility in deep learning models.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it is a common practice to use a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility. This is likely used in the deep learning pipelines of the research papers provided in the context.
