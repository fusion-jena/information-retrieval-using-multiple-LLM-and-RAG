Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some indications from the tables that suggest possible techniques used.

First, Table 3 shows the 13 steps of the model with corresponding log-likelihood values, Cox & Snell R-squared, and Nagelkerke R-squared. These values can be used to evaluate the model's performance and compare different steps, which might suggest the use of cross-validation or some form of iterative model improvement.

Second, Table 4 presents a classification table with observed and forecasted values for the binary outcome variable (Y), as well as the correct percentage and overall percentage. This table can be used to assess the model's performance in terms of accuracy and error rates, which could imply the use of stratified splitting or other techniques to ensure the model's generalizability.

Lastly, Table 5 lists the variables included in the equation, which might suggest the use of a diverse dataset. Including various relevant variables can help the model capture different patterns and relationships in the data, thereby improving its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly state the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, there are some indications that techniques such as cross-validation, stratified splitting, and the use of a diverse dataset might have been employed. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
