The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a deep learning model in the study. The machine learning models employed in the study include Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Random Forest (RF), and Classification and Regression Tree (CART), but there is no mention of deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).

However, the study does mention some measures taken to ensure the robustness and validity of the models used. These measures include:

1. Utilization of data from the third and fourth natural environment surveys, incorporating various environmental variables, to assess the impact of urban development on species distribution. This provides a diverse dataset for the models to learn from.
2. Employment of seven different machine learning models and extraction of the Area Under the Curve (AUC) values for each model before and after urban development. This allows for a comparison of the performance of different models and provides a measure of how well the models generalize to new data.
3. Conducting a correlation analysis of the variables before model implementation to enhance the predictive performance of the model and mitigate the risk of overfitting. This helps to ensure that the models are not relying too heavily on any one variable and are able to generalize to new data.

Therefore, while the study does not explicitly mention the use of deep learning models, it does describe measures taken to ensure the robustness and validity of the models used, such as using diverse datasets, cross-validation through comparison of different models, and mitigating the risk of overfitting.
