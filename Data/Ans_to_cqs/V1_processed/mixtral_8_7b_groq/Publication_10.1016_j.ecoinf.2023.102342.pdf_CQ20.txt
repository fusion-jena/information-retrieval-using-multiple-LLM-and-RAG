The provided pieces of context do not directly mention the specific hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. However, they do discuss data mining and knowledge discovery processes, which can be used in conjunction with deep learning.

In the context of data mining, the Apriori algorithm is mentioned as a technique for identifying frequent itemsets in a given database. This algorithm involves joining and pruning processes, which are performed iteratively to locate the most frequent itemsets. While this algorithm does not directly involve deep learning, it is a part of the data mining process that can be used to preprocess data before training a deep learning model.

In terms of hardware resources, generally, deep learning models require significant computational power, and graphics processing units (GPUs) or tensor processing units (TPUs) are commonly used to accelerate the training process. GPUs and TPUs are specialized hardware designed to perform matrix and vector operations, which are fundamental to deep learning algorithms.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of GPUs or TPUs for training deep learning models, it is reasonable to assume that they would be used given the computational demands of deep learning algorithms.
