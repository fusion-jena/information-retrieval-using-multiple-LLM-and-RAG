The specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This information is derived from the context provided, which mentions that Xu et al. (2021) developed a CNN-based segmentation model for analyzing images. However, the context does not go into detail about the architecture or parameters of the CNN. It should be noted that the use of a CNN is not explicitly stated for the entire pipeline, but since the pipeline involves image analysis and segmentation tasks, a CNN is a reasonable choice given its success in similar applications.
