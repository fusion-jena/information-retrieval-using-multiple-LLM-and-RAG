Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of specific postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix after model training. However, the text does mention two indicators used to evaluate the effectiveness of each model in correcting sampling bias: the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) and ΔD.

The AUC is a common evaluation metric for binary classification models, measuring the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes. In this context, the AUC could be used to evaluate the model's performance in identifying the presence or absence of a species based on environmental covariates.

The ΔD is not explicitly defined in the text, but it appears to be a measure of the difference in some aspect of the model's performance before and after applying a bias correction method. Specifically, the text mentions that the sampling bias caused by environmental variables is presented by mapping the environmental space to the geographic space, and correcting sampling bias in environmental spaces is beneficial but requires further testing. The ΔD may be a measure of the improvement in model performance after applying a bias correction method in the environmental space.

Therefore, while the text does not explicitly mention postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps or Confusion matrix, it does mention two evaluation metrics (AUC and ΔD) that could be calculated after model training to assess the model's performance in correcting sampling bias.
