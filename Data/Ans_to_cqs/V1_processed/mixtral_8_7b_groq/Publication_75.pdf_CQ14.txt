Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. The text does not mention any methods such as grid search, random search, or any other optimization techniques. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to this query. However, it is important to note that hyperparameter optimization is a crucial step in the development of machine learning models, as it can significantly impact the model's performance. Therefore, it is likely that the authors of the text employed some hyperparameter optimization technique, but they did not include the details in the provided context.
