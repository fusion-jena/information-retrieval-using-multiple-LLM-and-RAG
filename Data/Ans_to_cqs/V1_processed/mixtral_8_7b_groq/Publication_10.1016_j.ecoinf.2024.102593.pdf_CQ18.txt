The strategy implemented to monitor model performance during training in the context provided involves the use of Active Learning and Evaluation Vision (EV). Active learning is a process that progressively increases the training data by selecting those samples most likely to improve model performance from predictions that a model generates over unlabelled data. This is done iteratively by training new models with additional labelled data selected from their predictions, reducing the extent of manual annotation. 

In addition to this, EV is used to display model predictions in a visual space, which can contribute to selecting the best sample candidates for manual annotation. This can be particularly useful in monitoring the performance of models during training, as it can help in identifying those models that are most suitable for the intended bioacoustic task. 

Furthermore, when a trained model is deployed and run through field recordings, EV can be used to select possible calls of the Coxenâ€™s fig-parrot. This can provide insights into the performance of the model in real-world scenarios, which can be used to further refine and improve the model. 

In terms of model selection, it is common practice to train multiple models on the same dataset and then use statistical comparisons between the model predictions and known classes from a held-out part of the training dataset or an unrelated labelled dataset to guide decision making. However, the use of EV can complement these metrics by assessing and comparing the characteristics and suitability of trained models. 

Therefore, the strategy implemented to monitor model performance during training involves the use of active learning, EV, and statistical comparisons.
