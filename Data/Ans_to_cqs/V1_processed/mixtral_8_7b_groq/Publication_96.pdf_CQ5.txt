The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for mapping burned areas in the Cerrado biome in Brazil are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that spectral training samples of burned area (BA) and non-burned areas were used for the study. These spectral training samples were collected for the entire study area and were well distributed in space.

The training samples were used to train deep learning models, which were then used for model prediction and assessment. The models were able to differentiate spectral signatures of burned and unburned areas in the study area with high overall accuracy (97%).

Therefore, while the specific names of the datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet are not mentioned, it can be inferred that the dataset used in this study consists of spectral samples of burned and non-burned areas within the Cerrado biome. These spectral samples were used to train and test the deep learning models for mapping burned areas.
