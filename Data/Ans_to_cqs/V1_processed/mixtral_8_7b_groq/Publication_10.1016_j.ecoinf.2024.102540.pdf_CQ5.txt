The specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for training, validating, and testing the YOLOv5 model family to detect alates on sorghum leaves are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the dataset is split into a ratio of 80:10:10 for training, validation, and testing sets, respectively. The training dataset consisted of 1543 images at an input resolution of 640 × 640 pixels and 1637 images at an input resolution of 1280 × 1280 pixels. Similarly, the validation and testing sets consisted of 243 and 247 images, and 255 and 262 images, respectively, at the two different input resolutions.

While the specific names of the datasets are not provided, it can be inferred that they are likely to be images of sorghum leaves with alates, which are the reproductive stage of certain insects. These images were used to train and evaluate the performance of the YOLOv5 model family, which includes YOLOv5n, YOLOv5s, YOLOv5m, YOLOv5l, and YOLOv5x models. These models differ in complexity, with the nano (n) version being the simplest and the extra-large (x) version being the most complex.

In summary, while the specific names of the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not provided in the context, it can be inferred that they are likely to be images of sorghum leaves with alates, which were used to train and evaluate the performance of the YOLOv5 model family.
