Based on the provided context, there are several deep learning models used for plant leaf recognition and classification. However, the specific type of model is not explicitly mentioned for all the studies. Here are the models mentioned in the context:

1. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): Azadnia et al. (2022) used a deep CNN-based model with global average pooling for medicinal plant identification. Ganguly et al. (2022) utilized the ResNet-50 architecture, which is a type of CNN, for capturing leaf feature patterns.

2. VGG-16: Barhate et al. (2023) adapted the VGG-16 model for classifying thirty-two plant species. VGG-16 is a CNN model proposed by Simonyan and Zisserman (2014) that is known for its depth and high performance in image classification tasks.

3. The context does not explicitly mention Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) or Transformers being used in the studies.

In summary, the deep learning models used in the mentioned studies are primarily Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and its variants, such as VGG-16 and ResNet-50. There is no explicit mention of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) or Transformers being used in these studies.
