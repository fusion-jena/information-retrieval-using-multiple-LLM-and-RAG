The provided context does not directly discuss the methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of remote sensing data for classification models in the context of 4.3 Data Processing.

Remote sensing data is often collected through various types of sensors, including satellite, airborne, and ground-based sensors. Satellite sensors can capture data from different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, such as visible light, infrared, and ultraviolet, providing information about land cover, vegetation, temperature, and other environmental factors. Airborne sensors, such as LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), can provide high-resolution 3D data of the Earth's surface, useful for applications such as forest inventory and urban planning. Ground-based sensors can collect data at even higher resolutions, but are typically limited in coverage area.

In addition to sensors, remote sensing data can also be obtained from public datasets. For example, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) provides access to a wide range of satellite and aerial imagery through their Earth Explorer website. Other organizations, such as NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), also provide access to remote sensing data.

It's important to note that the selection of the data collection method depends on the specific requirements of the deep learning pipeline. Factors such as the spatial and temporal resolution, the spectral range, and the coverage area need to be considered when choosing the appropriate data source.

In summary, remote sensing data for deep learning pipelines can be collected through various sensors, such as satellite, airborne, and ground-based sensors. Public datasets are also a valuable source of remote sensing data. The choice of data collection method depends on the specific requirements of the deep learning pipeline.
