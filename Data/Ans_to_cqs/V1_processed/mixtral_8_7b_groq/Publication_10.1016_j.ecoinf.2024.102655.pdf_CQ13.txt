Based on the provided context, there is no specific information given about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. The context discusses the performance of machine learning models, specifically ANFIS, ANN, SVM, and extreme learning machine models, in predicting water quality. However, it does not provide details on the hyperparameters used in these models.

Hyperparameters are important configuration variables that are set prior to the training of a machine learning model. They include learning rate, number of hidden layers, number of neurons, batch size, optimizer, activation function, and regularization parameters. These hyperparameters significantly impact the performance of a deep learning model.

Therefore, without additional information, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to the query regarding the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
