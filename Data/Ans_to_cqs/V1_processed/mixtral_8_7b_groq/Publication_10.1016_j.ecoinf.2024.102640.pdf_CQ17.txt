The provided context does not contain specific information about the regularization methods used in the deep learning pipelines of GreenCam or EPDNet. However, it is possible to infer that some regularization techniques may have been used based on the overall design and evaluation of the models.

In the GreenCam project, the SegFormer model is used for photo green view index (GVI) measurement. SegFormer follows an encoder-decoder structure, where the encoder (MiT) is a Transformer-based model, and the decoder (ALL-MLP) is a lightweight decoder composed entirely of multilayer perceptron (MLP) blocks. The use of Transformers in SegFormer suggests that positional encoding or other attention-based regularization techniques might have been employed to handle the spatial dependencies in the input data.

In the EPDNet model, the authors use the ReLU activation function and sigmoid for non-linearity, which do not directly relate to regularization methods. However, during training, the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function and the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001 are used. These choices can indirectly help prevent overfitting by controlling the model's complexity and learning rate.

Common regularization techniques used in deep learning pipelines include L1 and L2 regularization, dropout, early stopping, and data augmentation. L1 and L2 regularization add a penalty term to the loss function to reduce the model's complexity. Dropout randomly sets a fraction of the input features to zero during training, preventing over-reliance on individual features. Early stopping halts training when the model's performance on a validation set stops improving, avoiding overfitting on the training data. Data augmentation generates new training samples by applying transformations (e.g., rotation, scaling, flipping) to the existing data, increasing the model's generalization capability.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of these regularization techniques, it is possible that some of them have been applied to the deep learning pipelines in GreenCam or EPDNet.
