The provided pieces of context do not directly discuss the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. However, they do contain information about machine learning methods used for image classification and vegetation analysis.

To answer the query, I will provide a general explanation of regularization methods used in deep learning, specifically focusing on dropout and L2 regularization.


Deep learning models, especially neural networks, are prone to overfitting when the model has too many parameters or when the training dataset is relatively small. Regularization techniques are used to mitigate overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function or modifying the model architecture.

Dropout is a regularization technique used during training to prevent over-reliance on individual neurons. It works by randomly dropping out, or deactivating, a fraction of neurons in each layer during training. This process encourages the model to learn more robust features and prevents overfitting.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is a technique that adds a penalty term to the loss function, proportional to the square of the model's weights. This penalty term discourages large weight values, which can lead to overfitting. By adding this term, the model is encouraged to distribute the importance of features more evenly, reducing the risk of overfitting.

In summary, dropout and L2 regularization are two common regularization techniques used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting. Dropout randomly drops out neurons during training, while L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, discouraging large weight values. These techniques help ensure that the model generalizes well to new, unseen data.
