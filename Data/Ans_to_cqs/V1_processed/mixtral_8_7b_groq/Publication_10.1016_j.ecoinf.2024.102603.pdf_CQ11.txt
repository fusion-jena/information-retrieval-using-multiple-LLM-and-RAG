I'm sorry for any confusion, but the provided context does not include information about a specific deep learning pipeline or its data repository link. The context discusses the differences between deep learning models and XGBoost, as well as the use of remote sensing instruments and satellite data for environmental monitoring. However, it does not offer a link to a deep learning pipeline's data repository on platforms such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
