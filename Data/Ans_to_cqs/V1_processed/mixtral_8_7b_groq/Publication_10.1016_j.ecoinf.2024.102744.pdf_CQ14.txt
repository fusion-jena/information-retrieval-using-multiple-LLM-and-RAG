The context does not provide explicit information on how the hyperparameters of the models were optimized, such as through grid search, random search, or other optimization techniques. However, it does mention that the proposed methods involve integrating the VnPollenBee dataset for the problem of counting pollen-bearing bees and applying improvements like focal loss and Overlap Sampler to existing models like YOLOv5 and Faster RCNN.

Focal loss is a loss function that focuses on optimizing the performance of the model on challenging samples by reducing the impact of straightforward samples on training loss and amplifying the significance of difficult ones. The hyperparameter Î± in the focal loss function controls the balance between the importance of easy and hard examples.

The Overlap Sampler technique used in the Faster RCNN model is not explicitly described in the context, but it likely involves some form of hyperparameter optimization to balance the disparity between background and foreground when generating boxes.

Therefore, while the context does not provide explicit information on the optimization techniques used for hyperparameter tuning, it can be inferred that some form of hyperparameter optimization was used in the proposed methods involving focal loss and the Overlap Sampler technique.
