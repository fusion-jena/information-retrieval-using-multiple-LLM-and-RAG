The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline, as indicated by the context, is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident in the statement that mentions a CNN pre-trained on ImageNet. Additionally, the context discusses the use of ImageNet, which is a large-scale dataset used for training and testing CNNs. Furthermore, the concept of feature maps across multiple layers, a characteristic feature of CNNs, is also mentioned. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a CNN.
