The purpose of the deep learning model, in the context provided, is for landscape type classification. This model is used to predict the types of landscapes in a case study area. The deep learning techniques employed in this process involve several stages, including the evaluation of five network models using performance metrics of validation and test sets. The model accuracy is continuously assessed using the validation set during training, and the performance of the testing set guides the final decision.

The deep learning model used here is specifically a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is a popular deep learning architecture applied to image classification. The CNN model consists of convolution layers, pooling layers, fully connected layers, and nonlinear operations, which are effective in the extraction of underlying abstract features from images.

In this specific application, several state-of-the-art CNN architectures, including the Visual Geometry Group (VGG), Inception, and residual network (ResNet) CNNs, were fine-tuned using the training dataset. The ResNet architecture, particularly ResNet50 and ResNet101, outperformed the other networks. The learning curves of these models indicate a reduction in training losses as the number of epochs increases, with convergence within 500 epochs.

Therefore, the deep learning model in this context is used for landscape type classification, and it employs a CNN architecture for this task. The model's performance is evaluated using validation and test sets, and the ResNet architecture, specifically ResNet50 and ResNet101, provides the best performance.
