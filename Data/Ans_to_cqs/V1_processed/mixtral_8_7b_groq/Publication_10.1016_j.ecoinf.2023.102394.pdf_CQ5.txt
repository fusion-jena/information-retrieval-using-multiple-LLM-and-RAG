The provided context does not specifically mention the use of standard deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention the use of a soil organic carbon (SOC) dataset in a deep learning study. This dataset is referred to as the "SOCS database," and it contains SOC data organized by depth, with a specific set of 2207 SOCS at depths from 0 to 20 cm from 2010 to 2014 being used in the study.

In addition, the context also mentions the use of the Keras library in the deep learning pipeline. Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It is often used for building and training deep learning models using various types of datasets.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly list the standard deep learning datasets, it does mention the use of a specific dataset in a deep learning study and the use of a library commonly used in deep learning pipelines.
