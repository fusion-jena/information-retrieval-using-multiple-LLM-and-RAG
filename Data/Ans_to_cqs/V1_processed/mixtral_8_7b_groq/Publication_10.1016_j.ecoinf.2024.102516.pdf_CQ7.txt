The provided context does not give specific details about the criteria used to split the data for training the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the network is trained in three phases. In the first phase, a classification network is trained using GBIF image data, and in the second phase, a segmentation network is trained on the same GBIF image data using the weak segmentation maps generated in the first phase. In the third phase, the network's weights can be used to train a plant cover prediction network on actual vegetation data or applied directly to vegetation data to generate zero-shot predictions without any training on plant cover annotations.

It can be inferred that the data splitting criteria might have been applied during the training of the classification network in the first phase and the segmentation network in the second phase. A common approach for splitting data in machine learning is to use a portion of the data for training, another portion for validation, and the remaining for testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and select the best model, and the test set is used to evaluate the final model's performance.

In the context of this study, the authors might have used a similar approach to split the GBIF image data into training, validation, and test sets. However, without more information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
