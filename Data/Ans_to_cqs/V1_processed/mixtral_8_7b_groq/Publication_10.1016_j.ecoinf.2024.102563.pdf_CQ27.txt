Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model. However, I can describe a general process that is typically used to deploy a deep learning model, which might be similar to the one used in the studies referenced here.

Once a deep learning model has been trained and validated, it needs to be serialized, or saved, so that it can be loaded and used in a production environment. Model serialization involves saving the model architecture and weights to a file, which can then be loaded and used to make predictions. There are several popular formats for model serialization, including HDF5, JSON, and YAML.

After the model has been serialized, it needs to be deployed on a platform that can handle requests for predictions. There are many different platforms that can be used for deep learning model deployment, including cloud-based platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP), as well as on-premises platforms like Kubernetes and Docker.

When selecting a platform for deep learning model deployment, there are several factors to consider, including:

* Scalability: Can the platform handle a large number of requests for predictions?
* Latency: How long does it take for the platform to return a prediction?
* Integration: Can the platform be easily integrated with existing systems and workflows?
* Cost: How much does the platform cost to use?

Once a platform has been selected, the serialized model can be loaded and used to make predictions. This typically involves creating an API endpoint that accepts input data and returns a prediction. The API endpoint can be accessed by other systems and workflows, allowing the deep learning model to be used as part of a larger system.

In summary, while there is no specific information about the process used to deploy a deep learning model in the provided context, a general process involves serializing the model, selecting a platform for deployment, and creating an API endpoint for making predictions. When selecting a platform for deep learning model deployment, it is important to consider factors like scalability, latency, integration, and cost.
