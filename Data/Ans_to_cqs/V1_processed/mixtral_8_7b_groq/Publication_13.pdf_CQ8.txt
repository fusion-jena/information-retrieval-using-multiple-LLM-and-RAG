Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the study and findings related to image classification of unexplored biota using domain adaptation and a local low-quality dataset. It mentions the use of a convolutional neural network and specific training details but does not specify where the code is hosted. If you are interested in the code, I would recommend reaching out to the authors or looking for any related publications or resources where they might have provided it.
