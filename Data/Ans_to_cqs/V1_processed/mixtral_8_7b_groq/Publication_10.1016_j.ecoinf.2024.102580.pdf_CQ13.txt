The context provided does not give specific information about the learning rate and optimizer used in the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model used was a RestNet-50, which is a pre-trained convolutional neural network. It is common for pre-trained models to use a learning rate schedule that starts with a higher learning rate and gradually decreases it over time. As for the optimizer, it is likely that a variant of stochastic gradient descent, such as Adam or RMSprop, was used. But without explicit information, it is not possible to give a definitive answer.
