The provided pieces of context do not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The texts mention the use of various techniques and methods, such as cellular automata, backpropagation, and Gumbel softmax, in the development of a model for learning neighborhood relationships. However, they do not specify where the code for this pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
