I regret to inform you that there is no code repository link provided in the given context. The text focuses on discussing the use of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) for plant species identification, particularly analyzing the global and local responses of filters in each convolution layer. However, it does not mention or provide any link to a code repository related to the deep learning pipeline.
