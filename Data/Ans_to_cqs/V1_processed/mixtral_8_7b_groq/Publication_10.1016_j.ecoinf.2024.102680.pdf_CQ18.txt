The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training in the context provided involves the use of common objects in context (COCO) evaluation metrics. These metrics are used to quantitatively assess the effectiveness of the UODN (Unified Object Detection Network) model.

The input layer of the UODN performs preprocessing operations on the initial images, which include resizing the images to the required size and applying algorithms such as mosaic data augmentation. These preprocessing steps make the distribution of the input data more uniform and enhance the ability of the model to represent the data, thereby improving the model performance during training.

Additionally, to avoid information loss and extract more complete information for regulation, only half of the feature information is processed, while the other half is directly concatenated with the post-processed features. The batch size of all networks is set to 16 uniformly.

The COCO evaluation metrics provide a standardized way to measure the performance of object detection models, including UODN. These metrics include measures such as precision, recall, and intersection over union (IoU), which provide insights into the model's ability to accurately detect objects within an image.

By using these metrics, the model performance can be monitored during training to ensure that the model is learning effectively and to identify any potential issues that may arise during the training process. This information can then be used to make adjustments to the model or training process as needed to improve the model's performance.

Overall, the strategy for monitoring model performance during training involves the use of preprocessing techniques, batch size regulation, and COCO evaluation metrics to ensure that the UODN model is learning effectively and accurately detecting objects within an image.
