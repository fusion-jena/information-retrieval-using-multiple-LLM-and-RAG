The provided context discusses techniques for handling structurally incomplete data in the context of regression tasks and vegetation modeling, rather than addressing data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, I will attempt to provide a helpful response based on the given information.

In the context provided, two techniques for handling structurally incomplete data are mentioned: random reduction and non-random (biased) reduction.

Random reduction (technique 2) involves reducing each target in the composition by a random fraction. This can result in some targets being reduced to 0. This technique can be seen as a way of artificially creating incomplete data to study the effects of such incompleteness on the predictive task.

Non-random (biased) reduction (technique 3) is similar to random reduction, but only a few selected targets are reduced. This approach aims to imitate the biased incompleteness of specific target labels, again providing a way to study the impact of such incompleteness on the predictive task.

While these techniques do not directly address data bias during preprocessing, they can be used to understand how the model performs under different conditions of data incompleteness. This knowledge can indirectly help in addressing data bias by providing insights into how the model behaves with different subsets of the data.

Techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling are more directly related to handling data bias and imbalance in a deep learning pipeline. Stratified splitting ensures that the train and test datasets have approximately the same percentage of samples of each target class. Oversampling and undersampling techniques aim to balance the class distribution in the dataset by either duplicating samples from the minority class (oversampling) or removing samples from the majority class (undersampling). Diverse data collection focuses on gathering data from various sources and ensuring that the data is representative of the problem space.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss techniques for handling data bias during preprocessing, it does present methods for studying the impact of data incompleteness. To directly address data bias, techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection can be employed during the preprocessing phase of a deep learning pipeline.
