The provided context discusses the data preprocessing steps taken for a specific biodiversity study, which involves several stages that can be relevant to the preprocessing of data before training a deep learning model.

First, the original records from GBIF and OBIS databases were downloaded, totaling 71,670,596 records. Then, data curation was performed, following the workflow by Zizka et al. (2020), reducing the number of records to 5,380,439. This step likely included activities such as removing duplicates, correcting inconsistencies, and dealing with missing or invalid data.

Next, the dataset was taxonomically filtered, keeping only the records with complete taxonomic information down to the species level, resulting in 5,007,322 records. After this, data outside the native range were deleted, leaving 820,004 records for the analysis. This step might be considered a part of data cleaning or data selection, where only the relevant data for the study are kept.

In the context of deep learning, the following preprocessing steps are commonly involved before training a model:

1. Normalization/Scaling: This process involves rescaling the data to a common range, often between 0 and 1, to avoid features with larger values from dominating the learning process. Techniques such as min-max scaling or standardization can be used.

2. Cleaning: This step includes handling missing data, removing outliers, and correcting inconsistencies in the data. In the provided context, this was done by removing records with NA values and deleting data outside the native range.

3. Feature engineering/Selection: Depending on the problem and the data, it might be necessary to create new features, extract relevant information, or even reduce the dimensionality of the data. In the provided context, this was done by retaining specific columns such as "scientific name", "family", "year", "longitude", and "latitude".

Based on the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model would include data cleaning, normalization/scaling, and feature engineering/selection.
