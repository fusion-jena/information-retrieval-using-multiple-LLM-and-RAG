Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, we can infer that the model was likely serialized and then integrated into a specific platform or system, as is typical in machine learning projects.

Model serialization is the process of saving the trained model's architecture, weights, and biases to a file, allowing it to be easily loaded and used for making predictions on new data. This is often a crucial step in deploying deep learning models, as it enables the model to be shared and used by others, even if they did not participate in the training process.

The context suggests that the deep learning models were developed for agricultural applications, particularly in the context of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) activities. As such, the platform selection would likely involve integrating the serialized model into a system that can analyze remote sensing data, such as a geographic information system (GIS) or a satellite image processing platform.

It is also worth noting that the researchers emphasized the importance of using classification models that provide explainable predictions. This suggests that the chosen platform should be capable of providing insights into the model's decision-making process, such as highlighting the most discriminative regions used by the CNN to identify a class.

Some of the papers cited in the context discuss methods for evaluating the interpretability of deep learning models, such as gradient-based sensitivity analysis (GBSA), Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), and class activation maps. These techniques could be used to further evaluate the deployed model's performance and interpretability.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, it is likely that the model was serialized and integrated into a remote sensing data analysis platform. The researchers' emphasis on model interpretability suggests that the chosen platform should be capable of providing insights into the model's decision-making process.
