The provided context does not give specific information about the strategies used to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention that a random grid search approach was used to fine-tune the model parameters, which implies that some degree of randomness was introduced during the model training process.

In general, there are several strategies that can be employed to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines. One common approach is to set a fixed seed value to ensure reproducibility of results. This can be done in popular deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. By setting a seed value, the random number generator used in the library is initialized to a specific state, and subsequent random number generations will be the same across different runs of the code.

Another strategy to handle randomness is to use techniques such as cross-validation, which involves dividing the dataset into multiple folds and training the model on different subsets of the data. This can help reduce the impact of randomness on the model's performance, as the model is trained and evaluated on different subsets of the data.

In addition, techniques such as dropout and batch normalization can be used to introduce randomness during the training process, which can help improve the model's generalization performance. Dropout randomly sets a fraction of the neurons in a layer to zero during training, which can help prevent overfitting. Batch normalization normalizes the inputs to each layer, which can help reduce internal covariate shift and improve the model's convergence properties.

Overall, while the provided context does not give specific information about the strategies used to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, there are several common approaches that can be employed, such as setting a fixed seed value, using cross-validation, and introducing randomness during the training process through techniques such as dropout and batch normalization.
