Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, data augmentation is a common practice in deep learning, especially for computer vision tasks, to increase the diversity of the training data and reduce overfitting.

Some of the common data augmentation techniques for images include flipping, rotating, scaling, and cropping. Flipping refers to horizontally or vertically flipping the images, which can help the model generalize better to objects with different orientations. Rotating involves rotating the images by a certain angle, which can help the model recognize objects in different poses. Scaling changes the size of the images, which can help the model learn to recognize objects of different scales. Cropping removes some parts of the images, which can help the model focus on the important features and reduce the impact of background noise.

In the context of the study, the authors mentioned that they used a pre-trained deep learning model called Darknet and modified some of its parameters for their specific task. Darknet is a popular open-source neural network framework for object detection, which is known for its speed and accuracy. According to the Darknet documentation (<https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet>), it supports various data augmentation techniques, including flipping, rotating, scaling, and cropping. Therefore, it is possible that the authors used some of these techniques in their study, but they did not explicitly mention them in the provided context.

In summary, while the provided context does not specify the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it is likely that the authors used some common techniques such as flipping, rotating, scaling, and cropping, as they are widely used in computer vision tasks and supported by the Darknet framework.
