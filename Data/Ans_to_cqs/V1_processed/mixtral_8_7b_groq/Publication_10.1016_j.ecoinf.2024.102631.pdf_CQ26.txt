The provided context discusses various image enhancement techniques, both classical and deep learning-based, for improving visual quality and extracting meaningful information from images. However, it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer based on the given context.

However, I can enumerate some common techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique ensures that the distribution of labels remains similar in both training and testing sets. It is particularly useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets.

2. Oversampling: In oversampling, the minority class is increased by replicating samples. This technique can help balance the dataset but may lead to overfitting if not done carefully.

3. Undersampling: Undersampling involves reducing the size of the majority class to balance the dataset. This technique may result in loss of information from the majority class.

4. Diverse data collection: Collecting data from various sources and ensuring representation from different demographics can help reduce data bias.

5. Data augmentation: Techniques such as rotation, flipping, and zooming can help increase the size of the dataset and create more diverse samples.

6. Reweighting: In reweighting, samples from the minority class are given higher weights during training to compensate for the imbalance.

While these techniques are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, they are essential considerations when working with deep learning pipelines to ensure fairness and reduce data bias.
