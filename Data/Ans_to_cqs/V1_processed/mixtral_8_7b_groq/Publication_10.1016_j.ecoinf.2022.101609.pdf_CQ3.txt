The provided pieces of context do not include information on the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, they do mention the use of deep learning for air quality monitoring and prediction, as well as the evaluation of a low-cost particle sensor using machine-learning methods.

In the context of air quality monitoring, the deep learning model is used to predict pollutant concentration levels such as PM2.5, PM10, and NO2. The data used for these predictions is structured with additional features added to extend a typical time-series problem, allowing for the exploration of entity embeddings for categorical features. However, the specific data annotation techniques used for this pipeline are not mentioned.

In the evaluation of a low-cost particle sensor, the authors used machine-learning methods to calibrate the sensor in ambient conditions. They used a four-layered architecture composed of a hardware layer, data storage layer, integration layer, and analytics layer. The hardware layer includes a low-cost particle sensor, and the analytics layer includes machine-learning algorithms for calibration. However, the specific data annotation techniques used for this pipeline are also not mentioned.

In summary, while the provided pieces of context discuss the use of deep learning for air quality monitoring and the evaluation of a low-cost particle sensor, they do not include information on the specific data annotation techniques used in these pipelines.
