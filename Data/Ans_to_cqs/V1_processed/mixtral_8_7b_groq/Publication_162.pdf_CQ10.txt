Based on the provided context, there is no mention of a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used for fauna and flora analysis. The text describes the methods and processes used for biodiversity monitoring, species classification, and animal detection using sensor networks, camera trapping with color and depth sensors, and deep learning techniques. However, it does not provide a direct link to the code repository used in the study.

The authors, Radig et al., published their research in the journal Pattern Recognition and Image Analysis, but the text does not indicate if they have shared their code on popular platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. It is common for researchers to share their code to promote transparency and reproducibility, but it is not always required or feasible due to various factors, including project constraints and intellectual property considerations.

If you are interested in the specific deep learning pipeline used in this study, I would recommend contacting the authors directly or looking for related projects on their affiliated institutions' websites:

1. Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Computer Vision Group: <https://cvg.informatik.uni-jena.de/>
2. University of Potsdam, IT Systems Engineering: <https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/informatik/studium/studienangebot/it-systems-engineering.html>

They may be able to provide more information about the code repository or related resources for their deep learning pipeline.
