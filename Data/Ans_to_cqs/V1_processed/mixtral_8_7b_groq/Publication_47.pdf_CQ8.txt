The code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study for evaluating the conservation status of Orchidaceae family is available on GitHub. The package, named IUCNN, can be found at the following URL: <https://github.com/azizka/IUCNN>. This package is based on the Python (version 3.7) TensorFlow library and implemented as an R package. The study used a deep neural network algorithm, IUC-NN, to predict the conservation status of unevaluated orchid species based on four groups of features derived from digitally available occurrence records, including geographic, climatic, biome, and anthropogenic features. The IUC-NN model was trained on all species with an IUCN Red List assessment and available occurrence records, and the code repository provides the necessary tools to replicate the study and apply the model to other species.
