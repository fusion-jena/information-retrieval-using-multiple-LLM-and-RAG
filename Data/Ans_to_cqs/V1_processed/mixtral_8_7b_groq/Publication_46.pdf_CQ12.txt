The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This information is provided in the first piece of context, which states that "A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used" for processing multidimensional data in a grid pattern. This model is used to establish the linear and nonlinear relationship between ecological and atmospheric variables and the occurrence scenarios of the species. The CNN model outperformed the traditional BIOCLIM model, with an AUC value of 0.917 compared to 0.68 for BIOCLIM. The kappa value was also higher for CNN (0.94) than for BIOCLIM (0.76), indicating a better agreement between the predicted and observed values. The distribution pattern of the predicted Rhododendron arboreum using CNN architecture was also found to be different in some places than the conventional BIOCLIM models. Overall, the CNN model proved to perform better than the traditional BIOCLIM model for species distribution.
