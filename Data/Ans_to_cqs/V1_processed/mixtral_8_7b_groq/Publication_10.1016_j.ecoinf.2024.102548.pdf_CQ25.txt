The provided context discusses the use of two specific deep learning models, ResNet-50 and InceptionV3, in the context of a classification task. However, it does not explicitly mention the specific purpose of the deep learning model in the study. Nevertheless, given that both ResNet-50 and InceptionV3 are commonly used for image classification, it is reasonable to infer that the deep learning model in this study is also used for image classification.

Image classification is the process of assigning a label or category to an image based on its visual content. For instance, an image classification model might be trained to identify and categorize images of animals, vehicles, or objects. In this study, the authors use deep learning techniques to develop a model capable of accurately classifying images into different categories.

The authors use a consistent set of parameter settings for each model, including training for 10 epochs, using a batch size of 32, and setting the class mode to 'categorical' for multi-class classification tasks. These settings ensure comparability and standardization throughout the study experiments.

ResNet-50 and InceptionV3 are both pre-trained on large-scale datasets, allowing them to capture complex patterns and achieve strong performance in image classification tasks. ResNet-50 uses residual blocks with skip connections to enable the flow of gradients and facilitate the training of deeper models. InceptionV3, on the other hand, incorporates the concept of inception modules, which utilize parallel convolutions of different kernel sizes to capture multi-scale features.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly state the purpose of the deep learning model, it can be inferred that the model is used for image classification based on the discussion of the two specific models used in the study. ResNet-50 and InceptionV3 are both commonly used for image classification tasks, and the authors use consistent parameter settings for each model to ensure comparability and standardization throughout the study experiments.
