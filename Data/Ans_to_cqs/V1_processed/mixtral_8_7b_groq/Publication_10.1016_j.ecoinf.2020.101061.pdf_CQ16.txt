Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete for the models in the study. The text describes the process of training models using different proportions of hand-annotated data, but it does not mention what conditions were used to decide when to stop training.

The study does mention that they reran the experiments five times for each site, which suggests that they may have used a form of early stopping based on a validation set to prevent overfitting. However, this is not explicitly stated in the text.

Additionally, the study mentions that they used ablation curves to show the performance of the models trained with different proportions of hand-annotated data. Ablation curves typically show the performance of a model as a function of some variable, such as the number of training examples or the amount of regularization. In this case, the curves show the performance as a function of the proportion of hand-annotated data used for training. However, these curves do not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.

In summary, while the study describes the process of training models using different proportions of hand-annotated data, it does not provide explicit information on the criteria used to determine when training is complete.
