Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. However, we do know that a classification dendrogram was generated using the FIT pairwise comparison model for 44 trails from captive Amur tigers. The algorithm was then used to classify free-ranging Amur tiger trails.

The process of generating the classification model involved iterating multiple times and altering elements within the model to minimize misclassifications. The final classification model correctly predicted all 44 tigers, resulting in 100% accuracy.

In the context of classifying tiger trails, postprocessing steps might include:

1. Metrics calculation: Computing various metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1-score, to evaluate the performance of the classification algorithm.
2. Confusion matrix: Creating a confusion matrix to visualize the performance of the algorithm, comparing the predicted classes against the actual classes.
3. Visualization: Generating saliency maps or other visualizations to help interpret the model's decision-making process and understand which features contribute the most to the classification.

However, the given context does not explicitly mention these postprocessing steps. It is possible that the study focused primarily on the development and validation of the classification algorithm, and did not include detailed descriptions of postprocessing steps.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, it is reasonable to assume that metrics calculation, confusion matrix, and visualization techniques like saliency maps could be part of the postprocessing analysis in a similar study.
