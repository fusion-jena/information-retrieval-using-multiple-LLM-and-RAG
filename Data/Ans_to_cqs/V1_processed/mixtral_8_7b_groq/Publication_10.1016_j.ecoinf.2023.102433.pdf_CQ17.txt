While the provided context does not directly discuss regularization methods used in deep learning to prevent overfitting, I can provide a brief overview of such methods using general knowledge.

Regularization methods are techniques used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise, and performs poorly on unseen data. Regularization introduces a penalty on the model's complexity to prevent overfitting.

Two common regularization methods are:

1. L2 regularization (also known as weight decay or Ridge regression):
This method adds a penalty term to the loss function, proportional to the square of the model's weights. This encourages smaller weights, preventing the model from fitting the noise in the training data. The L2 regularization term has the form of α * ||w||^2, where w represents the model's weights, and α is the regularization strength, a hyperparameter that needs to be tuned.

2. Dropout:
Dropout is a regularization technique specifically designed for neural networks. During training, dropout randomly sets a fraction (p) of the neurons in a layer to zero, preventing the network from relying too much on any single neuron. This helps the model generalize better and reduces overfitting. Dropout is applied during training, and at test time, all neurons are used.

These regularization techniques can be applied together or separately, depending on the specific deep learning pipeline. Other regularization methods include L1 regularization, early stopping, data augmentation, and batch normalization.

In summary, L2 regularization and dropout are two common regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. These techniques discourage the model from learning the noise in the training data, improving its ability to generalize to unseen data.
