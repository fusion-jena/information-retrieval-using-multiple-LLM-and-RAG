Based on the provided context, there is not enough information to explicitly describe the process that was followed to deploy a specific trained deep learning model. However, I can outline a general process that is typically involved in deploying a deep learning model using the information from the context.

First, a deep learning model is trained using a dataset. In the context, there are multiple studies that use machine learning and deep learning techniques for various applications in ecological informatics and remote sensing. For instance, Zhang et al. (2024) trained a model based on UAV multispectral features and machine learning to detect damage caused by Erannis jacobsoni Djak. in Sibirica Ledeb. Similarly, Ning et al. (2020) developed a rapid rice blast detection and identification method using a deep learning model.

Once the model is trained, it is necessary to serialize the model for deployment. Model serialization is the process of saving the model architecture and trained weights to a file, allowing the model to be loaded and used for inference at a later time. Although the context does not explicitly mention model serialization, it is a standard practice in deep learning model deployment.

After serialization, the platform for deployment is selected. Depending on the application, the platform can vary. For instance, if the model is intended for real-time inference on edge devices, such as drones or mobile devices, lightweight model deployment frameworks like TensorFlow Lite or ONNX Runtime are used. On the other hand, if the model is intended for server-side inference, frameworks like TensorFlow Serving or TorchServe are used. The context does not provide information on the specific platform used for deployment.

Lastly, the deployed model is integrated into the target application. This can involve creating an API for the model, integrating it into a web application, or embedding it into a mobile or edge device application. Again, the context does not provide information on the specific integration of the trained deep learning models.

In summary, while the provided context does not contain specific details about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model, a general process can be inferred. This process includes training the model, serializing it, selecting a deployment platform, and integrating the model into the target application.
