The metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models for image segmentation can include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics are commonly used in the context of the studies provided, which involve the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and region-based CNNs for segmenting objects in unmanned aerial systems imagery and LiDAR data.

Accuracy is the ratio of the number of true positive predictions (correctly classified instances) to the total number of instances. It provides an overall measure of the model's performance but can be misleading if the classes are imbalanced.

Precision, also known as positive predictive value, is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of positive predictions (true positives + false positives). It measures the proportion of correct positive predictions out of all positive predictions made by the model.

Recall, also known as sensitivity, is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of actual positive instances (true positives + false negatives). It measures the proportion of correctly identified positive instances out of all actual positive instances.

The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced assessment of both metrics. It is a more reliable measure when dealing with imbalanced classes.

In the context of the study by Liu and Abd-Elrahman (2018), the authors used overall accuracy, kappa coefficient, and F1 score to evaluate the performance of their deep CNN model for wetlands classification using unmanned aerial systems imagery.

In the study by Marasigan et al. (2019), the authors used root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2) to evaluate the performance of their mangrove crown diameter measurement method using airborne LiDAR data.

In the study by Martins et al. (2021), the authors used accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate the performance of their machine learning model with SLIC for tree canopies segmentation in urban areas using LiDAR data.

In the provided table, the authors used true positives (TP), false negatives (FN), false positives (FP), recall, precision, and F1 score to evaluate the segmentation results of their bird's eye view (BEV) Faster R-CNN algorithm for LiDAR data.
