Based on the provided context, there is no mention of a deep learning model or its associated hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer. The study describes a method for estimating model parameters for physiologically based models, using a combination of least squares (LS) methods and genetic algorithms, followed by a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. However, there is no mention of deep learning models or hyperparameters in this context. The computational tools mentioned are related to the implementation of the LS and MCMC methods, such as the DAFNE HPC scientific computing center and the Python package Ray. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query regarding the hyperparameters of a deep learning model.
