Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context discusses two articles related to the use of Sentinel-2 satellite data for analyzing wetlands in East Africa, specifically focusing on wetland use intensity (WUI) and its variation across different wetland management categories.

The first article, "Improving Cloud Detection with Machine Learning," published on Medium, does not provide any details about the optimization of hyperparameters for machine learning models. It discusses the use of machine learning techniques for cloud detection in satellite imagery but does not delve into the specifics of model training or hyperparameter tuning.

The second article, "Ecological Informatics," published in 2023, presents the results of a study analyzing WUI across different wetland management categories. The study uses the Tukey Honest Significant Differences (HSD) test and Jeffries-Matusita distance to compare WUI values between different categories. However, there is no mention of hyperparameter optimization methods such as grid search, random search, or any other techniques.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query regarding the optimization of hyperparameters for the model.
