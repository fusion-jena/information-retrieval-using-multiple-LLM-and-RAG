The provided context does not specify the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses two machine learning methods, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Random Forests (RF), but it does not mention any particular datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are computational models inspired by the human brain's structure and functioning. The neural network is composed of multiple layers of neurons that carry out linear combinations of the input values from the preceding layer, followed by a non-linear activation function. The trainable parameters of the network are the weights associated with the linear combinations performed by each individual neuron.

Random Forests (RF) is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. Each tree is trained on a random subset of the data, and the final prediction is determined by aggregating the predictions of all trees. Random Forest releases robust results even when the number of observations is smaller than the number of variables or the variables are correlated.

The context describes a study that uses Random Forests to model net growth in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. The study configures three essential parameters in the RF training: the number of random regression trees, the number of division variables, and the minimum size of nodes. However, it does not mention any datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query regarding the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
