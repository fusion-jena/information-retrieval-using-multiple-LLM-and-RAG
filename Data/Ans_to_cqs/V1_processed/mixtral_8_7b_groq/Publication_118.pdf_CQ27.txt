Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, we can make some educated guesses based on common practices in the field.

First, it is likely that the model was saved or serialized after training, so that it could be loaded and used for inference without having to retrain the entire model. Model serialization is a common practice in deep learning, as it allows trained models to be easily shared and deployed.

Next, the platform for deployment would depend on the intended use case of the model. For example, if the model were to be used for real-time audio analysis on a mobile device, then a lightweight platform such as TensorFlow Lite or Core ML might be used. On the other hand, if the model were to be used for batch processing on a server, then a more heavyweight platform such as TensorFlow or PyTorch might be used.

It is also possible that the model was deployed using a cloud-based platform, such as AWS SageMaker or Google Cloud AI Platform. These platforms provide managed services for training and deploying machine learning models, and can be a convenient option for researchers and developers who want to focus on model development rather than infrastructure management.

Overall, while the specifics of the model deployment process are not provided in the context, it is likely that the model was serialized and deployed on a suitable platform based on its intended use case.
