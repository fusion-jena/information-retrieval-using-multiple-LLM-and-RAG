Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized in the study by Pahlevan et al., 2020. The study uses a machine learning approach to achieve seamless retrievals of chlorophyll-a from Sentinel-2 (MSI) and Sentinel-3 (OLCI) in inland and coastal waters, but it does not mention the hyperparameter optimization method.

Hyperparameter optimization is an essential step in machine learning model development, which can include methods such as grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and gradient-based optimization. Grid search and random search are two common methods used to find the best set of hyperparameters for a model. Grid search exhaustively searches through a manually specified subset of hyperparameter space, while random search randomly selects hyperparameters from a defined range.

Without specific information from the study, it is not possible to provide an accurate answer regarding the hyperparameter optimization method used. However, it is mentioned that the machine learning approach utilizes the XGBoost algorithm, which has its own set of default hyperparameters. These default hyperparameters can be adjusted during model training to improve the model's performance.

In conclusion, while the context provides information on the machine learning approach and the XGBoost algorithm used in the study by Pahlevan et al., 2020, there is no explicit mention of the hyperparameter optimization method. Therefore, it is not possible to answer this query without additional information.
