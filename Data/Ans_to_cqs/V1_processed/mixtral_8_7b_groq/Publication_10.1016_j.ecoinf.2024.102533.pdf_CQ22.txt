The provided context does not contain information about a deep learning model or its evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall. Instead, it discusses the evaluation of fish freshness using organoleptic parameters and machine learning techniques, specifically the K-Means clustering algorithm.

For evaluating the performance of the K-Means clustering algorithm, the context mentions three metrics: Distortion, Silhouette, and Calinski-Harabasz. These metrics are used to determine the optimal number of clusters for classifying fish freshness based on six organoleptic parameters.

1. Distortion: This metric calculates the sum of squared distances from each data point to its nearest cluster center. A lower Distortion value indicates better achieved cluster cohesiveness.

2. Silhouette: The Silhouette index measures the similarity of a data point to other points in the same cluster compared to different clusters. A higher Silhouette value indicates a better-defined cluster.

3. Calinski-Harabasz: This metric determines the ratio of dispersion between and within clusters. A higher Calinski-Harabasz value suggests a better clustering solution.

In summary, the provided context does not contain information on the evaluation metrics for deep learning models. Instead, it focuses on the evaluation of the K-Means clustering algorithm for fish freshness classification using Distortion, Silhouette, and Calinski-Harabasz metrics.
