The provided context discusses the use of deep learning models for image classification tasks, but it does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipelines. However, it can be inferred that some optimization techniques were used during the training of deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

In deep learning, optimization techniques are used to minimize the loss function and update the model parameters during the training process. Some of the commonly used optimization techniques include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Momentum, Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG), Adagrad, Adadelta, and Adam.

Based on the context, it can be inferred that the deep learning models were likely trained using a form of gradient descent optimization algorithm. Specifically, the use of TensorFlow 2.5.0 library suggests that the models were implemented using TensorFlow's built-in optimization algorithms. TensorFlow provides several optimization algorithms, including SGD, Adagrad, Adadelta, and Adam.

Moreover, the use of the term "learning rate" in the context suggests that the learning rate was adjusted during the training process. The learning rate is a hyperparameter that controls the step size of the optimization algorithm during the training process. Adjusting the learning rate is a common technique used to improve the training of deep learning models.

Therefore, while the specific optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, it can be inferred that a form of gradient descent optimization algorithm was used, and that the learning rate was adjusted during the training process.
