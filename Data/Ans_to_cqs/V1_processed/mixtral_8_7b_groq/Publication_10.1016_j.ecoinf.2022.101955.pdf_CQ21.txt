Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps followed after model training. However, it can be inferred that metrics calculation, such as the Kappa statistic, was likely performed since it is mentioned in the results section. A confusion matrix could also have been created as it is a common tool used to evaluate the performance of classification models.

In the context of the ANN model, the "nnet" package in R provides options for adjusting weighted decay and size, which can help to counter the effects of overfitting. This suggests that some form of model validation or evaluation was carried out, which typically involves comparing the model's predictions to actual values and calculating relevant metrics.

In the case of the kNN model, the approach depends on thorough image pre-processing to reduce sampling bias and ensure equal treatment of predictors when computing distance. This implies that some form of data pre-processing or cleaning was done prior to model training, but it does not specifically mention any postprocessing steps.

For the SVM model, the context mentions that the model uses support vectors to locate optimal decision boundaries that separate two LULC classes. However, it does not provide information on any postprocessing steps taken after model training.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific details on the postprocessing steps followed after model training, it can be inferred that metrics calculation was likely performed. Confusion matrix creation is also a strong possibility. However, further information would be needed to confirm these assumptions and provide a more complete answer.
