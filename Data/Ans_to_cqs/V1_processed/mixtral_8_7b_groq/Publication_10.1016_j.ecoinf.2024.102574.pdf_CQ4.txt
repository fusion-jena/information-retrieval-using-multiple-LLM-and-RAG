Based on the provided context, there are no specific mentions of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling being applied in any of the described deep learning pipelines. However, the context does mention the use of deep learning for classification of LiDAR and UAV point clouds for DTM creation and flood risk mapping (Geosciences 9, 323). In the context of point cloud data, data augmentation techniques could include adding noise, randomly sampling points, or applying transformations to the point clouds.

In the context of remote sensing and GIS, data augmentation techniques are often used to increase the size and diversity of training datasets, particularly when the available data is limited. For example, flipping, rotating, and scaling are common data augmentation techniques used in image classification tasks. These techniques can help improve the robustness and generalization of deep learning models by providing additional variations of the training data.

In the context of LiDAR and point cloud data, data augmentation techniques could include adding noise to the point clouds, randomly sampling points, or applying transformations such as translations, rotations, or scaling to the point clouds. These techniques can help increase the size and diversity of the training dataset, particularly when working with limited data.

Overall, while the provided context does not specifically mention the use of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling, these techniques are commonly used in deep learning pipelines for remote sensing and GIS applications, particularly when working with limited data.
