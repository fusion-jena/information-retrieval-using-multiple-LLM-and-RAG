The provided context does not give specific information about the deep learning frameworks used to build the models. We can only determine that the models were built using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) architecture, as indicated by the use of the YOLO loss function. The Python library scikit-learn was used for k-fold cross-validation and splitting the data, but it is not a deep learning framework. Therefore, the deep learning frameworks used to build the models remain unknown based on the given context.
