Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it is generally recommended to perform certain preprocessing steps before training deep learning models. These steps can include data cleaning, normalization, and scaling.

Data cleaning involves handling missing values and removing outliers that can negatively impact the performance of deep learning models. Normalization is the process of scaling numeric data to a common range, such as 0 to 1, to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model's learning process. Scaling is similar to normalization but involves transforming the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

In the context of Christin et al. (2019), they mention the use of deep learning models in ecology but do not provide details on the preprocessing steps taken. Similarly, in the study by Alday et al. (2017), they use machine learning algorithms, including random forest models, to analyze fungal productivity in Mediterranean environments, but they do not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps taken before training their models.

It is important to note that the specific preprocessing steps required may depend on the nature of the data and the deep learning algorithm being used. Therefore, it is essential to consider the characteristics of the data and the model when determining the appropriate preprocessing steps.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, it is generally recommended to perform data cleaning, normalization, and scaling as part of the preprocessing process. The specific preprocessing steps required may depend on the data and the deep learning algorithm being used.
