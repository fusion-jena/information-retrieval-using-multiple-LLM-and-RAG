The provided context discusses the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image analysis in a deep-sea environment, but it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of manual annotations for generating training, validation, and testing datasets, and the challenge of collecting representative datasets in the deep sea.

In general, techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline include:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into subsets based on certain criteria, such as class labels, to ensure that each subset is representative of the overall dataset.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of instances of a particular class in the dataset to balance the class distribution.
3. Undersampling: This technique involves decreasing the number of instances of a particular class in the dataset to balance the class distribution.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from a variety of sources and in a variety of conditions to ensure that the dataset is representative of the real-world scenarios that the model will encounter.

Based on the context provided, it can be inferred that the authors may have used manual annotations to ensure that the training, validation, and testing datasets were representative of the deep-sea environment they were studying. However, it is not explicitly stated whether they used any of the other techniques mentioned above to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
