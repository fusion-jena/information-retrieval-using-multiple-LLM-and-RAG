The deep learning pipeline in the context provided uses the Adam optimization technique. Adam, which stands for Adaptive Moment Estimation, is a method for stochastic optimization that was introduced by Kingma and Ba in 2015. It is used in the training of an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model for time series prediction in the specific case of air quality data in the city of Modena.

The LSTM model is trained using the mean squared error (MSE) as the loss function. To avoid overfitting, a dropout layer is added as a regularization method. The dropout layer randomly excludes some inputs from activation and weight updates while training the network. The training set is pre-processed using a MinMaxScaler that transforms each feature by scaling it to a [0â€“1] range.

The choice of the Adam optimization technique over other methods, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), is based on its ability to adaptively adjust the learning rate for each parameter. This is achieved by maintaining two estimates of the first and second moments of the gradients, which allow for more efficient and robust optimization.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline for air quality prediction in Modena uses the Adam optimization technique as part of the training process for an LSTM model. This method was chosen for its ability to adaptively adjust the learning rate and efficiently optimize the model parameters.
