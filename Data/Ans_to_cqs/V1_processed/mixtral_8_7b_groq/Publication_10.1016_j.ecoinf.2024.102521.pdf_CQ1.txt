The STARdbi pipeline utilizes sticky traps for collecting raw data of insects. These traps are used to sample flying insects, which are then covered with transparent acetate sheets. High-resolution scanning of the traps is carried out using an office scanner. The scanned images along with their metadata, such as time of placement and removal, location, and scanning resolution, are uploaded to the STARdbi database using its web interface. This process of capturing, scanning, and uploading the images of insects trapped on sticky traps forms the basis of the STARdbi pipeline for collecting raw data.

Additionally, the STARdbi pipeline uses machine learning models for automatic detection of insects in the scanned images. These models help in extracting information from the images and storing the position of the detected insects in the database. The pipeline also emphasizes the importance of data availability, with the raw and processed data being made available to the entomological community and the general public for further research and analysis.

It is worth noting that the provided context does not mention the use of any public datasets or sensors for collecting raw data in the STARdbi pipeline. The focus is on using sticky traps for capturing insects and scanning the traps for digitizing the data. This approach allows for large-scale surveys of species and biodiversity assessment, which is the primary goal of the STARdbi project.
