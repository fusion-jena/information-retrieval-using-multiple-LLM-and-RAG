The provided context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it does mention the use of Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) networks for clustering and Random Forest (RF) for classification. SOM networks are a type of artificial neural network used for unsupervised learning and are not considered deep learning models. RF is an ensemble learning method that can be used for both regression and classification tasks, but it is not a deep learning model either.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the pipeline does not use any deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers.
