The context does not provide specific information about the deep learning frameworks used to build the model. It mentions the use of BERT, a transformer model, for classification. However, it does not specify whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or another framework was used to implement BERT. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query.
