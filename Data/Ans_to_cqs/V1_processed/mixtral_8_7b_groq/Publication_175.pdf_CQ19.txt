The provided context does not give specific information about the frameworks used to build the deep learning model. While it mentions that ResNet-100, a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), was used as the classic deep learning algorithm, it does not specify the framework in which this algorithm was implemented.

Common frameworks for implementing deep learning models include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. TensorFlow is an open-source library developed by Google Brain Team, PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library developed by Facebook's AI Research lab, and Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano.

Without further information, it is not possible to give a definitive answer as to which framework was used to build the deep learning model in this case.
