Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete in the active learning process. However, it is mentioned that active learning involves iteratively training new models with additional labelled data selected from their predictions, which suggests that some criteria for evaluating model performance and determining when training is complete are being used.

In the context of model selection, it is mentioned that trained models can be assessed and compared using Embedding Visualizer (EV) to complement statistical comparisons between model predictions and known classes from a held-out part of the training dataset or an unrelated labelled dataset. This suggests that performance metrics are being used to evaluate model performance, but the specific criteria for determining when training is complete are not provided.

Additionally, the context mentions that when deploying a trained model through field recordings, EV can be used to select possible calls of the Coxen's fig-parrot. This implies that the trained model is being evaluated for its ability to accurately identify the target species in field recordings, but again, the specific criteria for determining when training is complete are not provided.

Therefore, while the context suggests that performance metrics are being used to evaluate model performance, it does not provide specific information on the criteria used to determine when training is complete in the active learning process.
