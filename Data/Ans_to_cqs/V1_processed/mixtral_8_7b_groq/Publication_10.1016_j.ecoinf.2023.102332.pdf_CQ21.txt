Based on the provided context, there is no information about postprocessing steps after model training such as generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, or creating a confusion matrix. The context mainly discusses the methods used for data collection, preprocessing, and word embedding using the word2vec model.

However, it is important to note that these postprocessing steps are often used in machine learning and natural language processing tasks. Saliency maps, for example, can be used to visualize the importance of input features in a model's prediction. Metrics calculation involves evaluating the performance of a model using various quantitative measures such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the predictions made by a classification model, showing the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

In the context provided, the authors use the pre-trained Baroni word2vec model to perform semantic analysis on the hiking trail descriptions. They do not mention any postprocessing steps after training the word2vec model. However, it is possible that they used some of these postprocessing techniques as part of their analysis.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention any postprocessing steps after model training, these techniques are commonly used in machine learning and natural language processing tasks. It is possible that the authors used some of these techniques as part of their analysis, but this information is not provided in the context.
