The provided context discusses the development and training of a deep learning (DL) model for sub-alpine shrub species identification, but it does not explicitly mention the process of deploying the trained model. However, it can be inferred that the model would need to be serialized and deployed on a platform for use in the automatic image processing system.

To deploy the trained DL model, the developers would likely follow these steps:

1. Model serialization: Once the DL model has been trained and evaluated, it needs to be saved in a format that can be loaded and used for making predictions on new data. This process is called model serialization. The serialized model can be stored as a file or in a database, and it can be deployed on a local machine or in a cloud environment.
2. Platform selection: The choice of platform for deploying the DL model depends on the specific requirements of the project. If the model is to be used for real-time image processing, a high-performance platform such as a GPU-enabled server or cloud service would be appropriate. If the model is to be used for batch processing, a less powerful platform such as a CPU-based server or a local machine may be sufficient.

The context mentions that the DL models are integrated into a study for automatic image processing, but it does not provide details on the specific platform used for deployment. Therefore, it is not possible to answer this part of the query without additional information.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the process of deploying the trained DL model, it can be inferred that the developers would likely follow the steps of model serialization and platform selection. However, the specific platform used for deployment is not mentioned in the context.
