The provided context does not give information about the specific deep learning pipeline used in the study. However, it does mention that an ensemble modeling approach was employed using the BIOMOD2 package in R to predict the distribution of study species. The models used include a regression-based model and three machine-learning models: Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

The data used in these models are likely in the form of CSV or similar tabular formats, as these models typically require input in the form of feature matrices, where each row represents a sample and each column represents a feature. In this study, the features used are related to climate data, including annual mean temperature (Bio1), temperature seasonality (Bio4), precipitation seasonality (Bio15), precipitation of driest quarter (Bio17), and temperature annual range (Bio7). Additionally, two features related to distance to roads (DRO) and distance to rivers (DR) are used.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that the data used in this study are in the form of CSV or similar tabular formats, containing climate and distance-related features.
