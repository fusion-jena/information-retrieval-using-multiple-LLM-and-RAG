The deep learning model is built using the Lasagne module, which is a deep learning framework constructed on top of Theano. Theano is a popular open-source Python library for efficiently defining, optimizing, and evaluating mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays. Lasagne simplifies the process of creating complex neural network architectures by providing a set of pre-built layers and utilities, making it easier to build and train deep learning models.
