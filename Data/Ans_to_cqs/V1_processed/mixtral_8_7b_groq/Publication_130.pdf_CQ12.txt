The type of deep learning model used in the described pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the context where it is mentioned that the VGG19 CNN architecture was used for image classification. CNNs are particularly useful in this context because they can classify images based on many features, which is necessary given the complexity of identifying bird species and distinguishing their activities such as feeding chicks or nest maintenance.
