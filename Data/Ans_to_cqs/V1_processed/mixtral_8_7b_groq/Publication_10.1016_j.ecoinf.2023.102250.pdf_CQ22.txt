The performance of the deep learning model in the context provided is evaluated using several metrics, including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Top-1 accuracy, Top-5 accuracy, Top-1 error, and Top-5 error. 

Accuracy is the ratio of the correctly predicted observations to the total observations. Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positive observations. Recall (Sensitivity) is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the all observations in actual class. The F1-score is the weighted average of Precision and Recall. It tries to find the balance between precision and recall.

Top-1 accuracy and Top-5 accuracy are used to evaluate the performance of the model in classification tasks. Top-1 accuracy is the proportion of images for which the top predicted class is the correct class. Top-5 accuracy is the proportion of images for which the correct class is in the top five predicted classes. Top-1 error and Top-5 error are their corresponding errors.

In addition to these, the Inception Score (IS) and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) are used to assess the quality of the generated images. The higher the IS, the higher the quality and better the diversity of the generated images. The FID measures the distance between two multivariate Gaussians and can be used to compare the similarity of two datasets of images.

Therefore, the performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using a combination of classification metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Top-1 accuracy, Top-5 accuracy, Top-1 error, and Top-5 error) and image quality metrics (Inception Score and Fréchet Inception Distance).
