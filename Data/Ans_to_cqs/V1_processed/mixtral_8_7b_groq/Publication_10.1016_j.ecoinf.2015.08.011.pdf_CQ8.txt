The provided context does not contain information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The text describes a study that used an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to predict mosquito abundances in urban areas. However, it does not mention or provide a link to any code repository platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I am unable to provide the location of the code repository based on the given context.
