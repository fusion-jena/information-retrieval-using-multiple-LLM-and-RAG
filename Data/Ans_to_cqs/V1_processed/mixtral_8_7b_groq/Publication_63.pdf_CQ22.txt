The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using two metrics: the mean squared error (MSE) and the mean absolute error (MAE). The MSE is used as the loss function during the training process, while the MAE is used to quantify the prediction accuracy and to assess the model's performance on the validation and test datasets. The MAE of the validation dataset is computed after each epoch to monitor the training progress and to check for overfitting. The MAE of the test dataset is then used to independently evaluate the trained model. The other metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall are not mentioned in the provided context.
