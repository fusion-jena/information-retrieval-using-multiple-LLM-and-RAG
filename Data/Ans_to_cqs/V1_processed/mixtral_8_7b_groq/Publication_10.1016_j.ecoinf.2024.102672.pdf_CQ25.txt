The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is to detect if there exists stratification in a reservoir. The model is designed as a classification model, where the output is a binary variable that indicates the presence or absence of stratification.

The deep learning model used in this study is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) composed of layers of neurons connected among them. Specifically, the ANN architecture includes sequential dense layers and dropout layers. Dense layers are fully connected layers where each neuron in a layer is connected to all the neurons of the previous layer. Each neuron receives an input, which is processed to produce an output by assigning a weight to each input, calculating the product of each input and its associated weight, and applying an activation function to obtain the output. Dropout layers are used to prevent overfitting by randomly setting the inputs to 0 with a given frequency rate during the training.

The initial hyperparameters space of the ANN includes the number of layers, the number of neurons of the dense layer, the dropout rate of the dropout layer, the learning rate, and the batch size. Specifically, the initial hyperparameters space consists of one or two dense layers with 32 or 64 neurons, a dropout rate of 0.2 or 0.4, a learning rate of 3 or 10, and a batch size of 32 or 64.

The purpose of the deep learning model is to predict the existence of stratification in a reservoir based on the input features. The model is trained on a dataset that includes the input features and a binary variable that indicates the presence or absence of stratification. After training, the model can predict the existence of stratification for new input features.

Overall, the deep learning model is used as a classification model to detect the presence or absence of stratification in a reservoir based on the input features. The model is designed using an ANN architecture with dense and dropout layers and trained on a dataset with input features and a binary variable indicating the presence or absence of stratification.
