The article does not provide specific details on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that Google Earth Engine (GEE) was used as the platform for handling the massive amount of data required by the pixel-based method. GEE provides an ideal platform for such tasks due to its powerful data storage and high computational capacity. Therefore, it can be inferred that the trained deep learning model was likely deployed on the GEE platform.

Moreover, the deep learning model was trained using spectral-phenological features of Spartina alterniflora, an invasive species in the cloudy coastal zone. The proposed Ppf-CM method eased the problems caused by the scarcity of entire scene cloud-free Landsat scenes, and the deep learning classifier optimized the use of the phenological information yielded from Ppf-CM.

However, the article does not mention any steps taken for model serialization, which is the process of saving the trained model into a file that can be used later for making predictions. Model serialization is an essential step in the machine learning pipeline, and it is usually performed to ensure that the trained model can be easily deployed and shared with others.

In summary, while the article provides some information on the platform used for deploying the trained deep learning model, it does not provide specific details on the process followed for model serialization. It can be inferred that the model was deployed on the GEE platform, but the steps taken for model serialization are not mentioned.
