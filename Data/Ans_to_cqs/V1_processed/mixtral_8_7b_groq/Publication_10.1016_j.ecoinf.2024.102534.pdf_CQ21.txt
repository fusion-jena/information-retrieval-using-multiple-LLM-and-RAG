Based on the provided context, there are several postprocessing steps that were taken after the model training, although not all of them are the typical steps usually associated with model training.

First, the model predictions were validated using a separate dataset. This was done by comparing the predicted suitable areas of orchids to the actual data. The Area Under Curve (AUC) evaluation metric and True Skill Statistics (TSS) were used to assess the performance of the model predictions.

Next, the predictive maps of current and future areas were classified into unsuitable (0-0.6) and suitable (0.6-1) categories. The threshold value of 0.6 was derived from equal training sensitivity and specificity. The suitable areas from the current prediction were then compared to future predictions to estimate change over time.

Furthermore, the predictive maps of four groups of orchids (lowland epiphyte, lowland terrestrial, upland epiphyte, upland terrestrial) during three time periods (current, future (2100) using SSP 1-2.6, and future (2100) using SSP 5-8.5) were compared. This was done to identify the potential impact of climate change and land cover change on suitable areas for each group.

It is important to note that while these steps were taken after the model training, they are not typical postprocessing steps such as generating saliency maps, calculating confusion matrices, or fine-tuning model parameters. However, the steps that were taken are still important in evaluating the performance of the model and understanding the impact of the model predictions.

In summary, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include validating the model predictions, classifying the predictive maps, comparing the predictive maps over time and across different groups of orchids, and estimating the impact of climate change and land cover change on suitable areas for each group.
