Based on the provided context, it is not possible to directly determine the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context focuses on the evaluation metrics and performance of various models, but it does not include information about the model's hyperparameters. Hyperparameters are crucial for the performance of a deep learning model, and they are usually chosen through a process of hyperparameter tuning. This process involves trying different combinations of hyperparameters and selecting the ones that result in the best performance. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide an accurate answer to this query.
