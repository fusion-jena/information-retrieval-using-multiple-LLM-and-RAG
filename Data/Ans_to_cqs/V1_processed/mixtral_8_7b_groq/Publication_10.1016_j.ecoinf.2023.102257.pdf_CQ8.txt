Unfortunately, the provided context does not contain information about a deep learning pipeline with a specific code repository. There are several articles and studies mentioned that use machine learning techniques, including deep learning, for species-level classification and image processing in the context of remote wildlife monitoring. However, none of them explicitly mention a code repository or a specific deep learning pipeline that is publicly available on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.

An example of a study that uses deep learning for species-level classification is by Torney et al. (2019), where they compare deep learning techniques with citizen science methods for counting wildlife in aerial survey images. Similarly, Vecvanags et al. (2022) present a study on ungulate detection and species classification from camera trap images using RetinaNet and faster R-CNN. However, neither of these studies mention a code repository or a deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query as the required information is not present in the provided context.
