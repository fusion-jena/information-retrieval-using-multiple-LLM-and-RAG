The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of an accuracy indicator, which is a measure that evaluates the performance of the model. However, the specific accuracy indicator used in this case is not mentioned in the provided context.

Additionally, the authors mention that they used the Faster R-CNN detection model based on the Inception-Resnet v2 CNN architecture, which was pre-trained on the COCO detection dataset containing over 200,000 images organized into 80 object categories. The two last fully connected layers of the network were retrained on the dataset using a learning rate of 0.001 and a decay factor of 16 every 30 epochs. The optimization algorithm used was RMSProp with a momentum of 0.9 and epsilon of 0.1.

The authors also mention the use of data-augmentation and transfer learning to boost the learning of CNNs on small datasets. Data-augmentation involves increasing the volume of the training dataset artificially, while transfer learning involves starting the learning of the network from a prior knowledge rather than from scratch. These techniques can help improve the performance of the model during training.

Furthermore, the authors built the second CNN-based model that counts whales by reformulating the problem into an object detection task. This implies that the model's performance was monitored in terms of its ability to accurately detect and count whales in images.

Overall, while the specific accuracy indicator used to monitor the model performance during training is not mentioned, the authors employed various techniques such as data-augmentation, transfer learning, and object detection to ensure the model's performance was optimal during training.
