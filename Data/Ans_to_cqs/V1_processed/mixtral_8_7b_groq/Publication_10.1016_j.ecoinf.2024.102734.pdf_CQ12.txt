The deep learning models used in the pipeline are ResNet-50, a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and two transformer-based models, Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) and HuBERT. The ResNet-50 model is a commonly applied architecture that operates on mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) represented as single-channel images. On the other hand, AST and HuBERT are transformer models that also perform classification tasks on spectrograms and 1-D waveform, respectively. These models are evaluated using the same feature extractor and user model pipeline with a two-class binary output. The models are trained and validated on a dataset containing 3000 5-second segments, with 80/20% training-validation split. The performance of these models is then evaluated on a separate testing dataset containing 500 samples.
