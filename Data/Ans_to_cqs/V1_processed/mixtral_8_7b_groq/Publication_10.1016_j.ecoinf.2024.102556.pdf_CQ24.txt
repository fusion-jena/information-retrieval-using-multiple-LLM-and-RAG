While the provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does mention the use of a "random sample consensus" method in the context of image analysis and automated cartography (Fischler & Bolles, 1981). This method, also known as RANSAC, is a technique used to estimate parameters of a mathematical model from a set of observed data which contains outliers. RANSAC is an iterative method that involves selecting a random subset of the data, fitting a model to that subset, and then classifying the remaining data points as inliers or outliers based on how well they fit the model. This process is repeated many times, and the model with the largest number of inliers is selected as the best fit.

In addition, the context also mentions the use of a "Random Erasing data augmentation" (FEN) in the Deep SORT model for object tracking. This technique randomly selects a rectangle within an image and replaces its pixels with random values, which helps to increase the robustness of the model by providing more varied training data.

Another strategy that can be used to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline is the use of a fixed random seed value. This ensures that the same sequence of random numbers is generated each time the model is trained, which can help to improve reproducibility of the results.

Furthermore, the context also mentions the use of different architectures such as Res2net (Gao et al., 2019) and Container (Gao et al., 2021) which can help to handle randomness by providing more robust and generalizable features.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does mention the use of RANSAC, Random Erasing data augmentation, fixed random seed value, and different architectures such as Res2net and Container which can help to handle randomness by providing more robust and generalizable features.
