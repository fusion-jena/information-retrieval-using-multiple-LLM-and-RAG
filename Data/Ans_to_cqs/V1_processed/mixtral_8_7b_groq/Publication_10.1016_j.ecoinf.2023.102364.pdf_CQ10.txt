The provided context does not include information about the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text mentions the use of an ensemble of machine learning models, including RandomForest, Treenet, CART, and MARS, but it does not give a link to the code repository. The study may have used one of the many available machine learning libraries or platforms, such as Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or Keras, but the specific code repository was not provided in the context. Therefore, I cannot give a specific answer to this query.
