Based on the provided context, there are no specific details about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention some metrics and statistical tests that are used in the context of the synthetic reef data pipeline. These are:

1. Chi-squared test (χ2test)
2. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
3. Correlation scores
4. Mean data quality score
5. Mean data diagnostics scores

The Chi-squared test (χ2test) and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test are statistical tests used to determine if there is a significant difference between two datasets. Correlation scores measure the strength and direction of a relationship between two variables. Mean data quality score and mean data diagnostics scores are measures of the overall quality of the synthetic data generated by the models.

As for postprocessing steps, the context mentions that the sites are ranked based on the aggregated value of the criteria, and the top N sites are chosen for restorative activities. This implies that some sort of ranking or selection process is carried out after the model training.

In the context of machine learning and neural network-based models, common postprocessing steps include:

1. Saliency maps: A visualization technique to indicate the importance of each input feature in making a specific prediction.
2. Metrics calculation: Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., are calculated to assess the performance of the model.
3. Confusion matrix: A table used to describe the performance of a classification model. It shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

However, the context does not explicitly mention any of these postprocessing steps. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query based on the given information.
