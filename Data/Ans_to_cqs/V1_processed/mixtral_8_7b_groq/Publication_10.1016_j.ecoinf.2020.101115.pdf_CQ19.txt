Based on the provided context, there is no information about which specific deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, were used to build a machine learning model. The context discusses various studies and resources related to marine science, fish stock assessment, and data management, but it does not mention the use of deep learning frameworks in model development. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
