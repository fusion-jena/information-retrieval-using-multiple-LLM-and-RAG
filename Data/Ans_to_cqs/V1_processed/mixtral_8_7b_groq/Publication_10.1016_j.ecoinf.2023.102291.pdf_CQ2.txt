Based on the provided context, the data used in the deep learning pipeline consists of dolphin sounds. These sounds are likely to be in a digital audio format, such as WAV or FLAC, which are uncompressed lossless audio formats that allow for precise analysis of the sound waves.

The pipeline involves preprocessing the audio data to extract features that can be used for training the deep learning models. Specifically, the algorithm investigates the impact of window size on the classification of dolphin calls. This preprocessing step may involve segmenting the audio files into smaller windows of a fixed length, which are then used as input to the deep learning models.

Once the audio data has been preprocessed, it is used to train deep learning models based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The CNNs are implemented using TensorFlow and Python 3, and are trained on Microsoft Azure using instance NV12s v3 with 12 vCPUs and 112 GB RAM. The algorithm chooses the most suitable architecture based on the best validation accuracy and precision obtained during training.

Therefore, while the original data is in an audio format, the preprocessing and deep learning steps involve working with numerical data, such as spectrograms or other audio features, which are likely represented as matrices or tensors in memory. However, the final output of the deep learning models is used for classification tasks, which may involve assigning labels or categories to the original audio files based on the predicted output of the models.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline used in this study involves working with digital audio data in formats such as WAV or FLAC, which are preprocessed to extract features that can be used for training CNNs. The final output of the models is used for classification tasks, which may involve assigning labels or categories to the original audio files.
