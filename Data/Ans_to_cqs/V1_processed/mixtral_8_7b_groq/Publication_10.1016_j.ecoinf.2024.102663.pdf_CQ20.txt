Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The text focuses mainly on comparing different regression models for pixel-to-cm conversion and discussing deep learning's potential role in fish biomass estimation.

However, it is important to note that, generally, deep learning models require substantial computational power for training. Commonly used hardware resources for training deep learning models include Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). GPUs are popular due to their ability to perform parallel processing, which is beneficial for handling the large number of computations required in deep learning. TPUs, on the other hand, are custom-built by Google for machine learning tasks and can provide even better performance for specific deep learning tasks.

Given the complexity of training deep learning models for fish biomass estimation, it is highly likely that the researchers used either GPUs or TPUs for their work. However, without explicit information in the provided context, it is not possible to give a definitive answer.
