Based on the provided context, the specific use of the deep learning model is not mentioned. However, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is used for producing a thematic map, which suggests a land cover or land use classification task.

In the paper "Advancing methodologies for applying machine learning and evaluating spatiotemporal models of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) using satellite data over large regions" by Just et al. (2020), a deep learning model is employed to predict PM2.5 concentrations. While the authors do not explicitly state the type of deep learning model used, they do mention that the model is trained using satellite data and that the output is a continuous surface representing PM2.5 concentrations. In the context of thematic maps, this could be considered a regression problem rather than a classification problem.

In the paper "The use of machine learning methods to estimate aboveground biomass of grasslands: a review" by Morais et al. (2021), machine learning methods, including deep learning, are used for estimating aboveground biomass of grasslands. While the authors do not specify the type of deep learning model used, they mention that these models are used for regression tasks, predicting continuous values of aboveground biomass.

In general, deep learning models can be used for various tasks, including classification, segmentation, and object detection. However, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is used for a classification or regression task in the context of thematic map production.
