The provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of deep learning in segmenting individual mangrove trees from UAV-borne LiDAR data and training a Faster R-CNN detector using manually labeled BEV images. In this context, a possible strategy for handling randomness could be the use of a fixed random seed value during the training process.

In deep learning, randomness can be introduced in various ways, such as the initialization of weights, the order of training samples, and the use of dropout regularization. A fixed random seed value ensures that the same random events are reproducible across different runs of the training algorithm, which can be useful for debugging, comparing different models, and reporting results.

For instance, in the training of the Faster R-CNN network with a Resnet-101 backend, a learning rate of 0.003, momentum of 0.9, and a batch size of 1 were used for 20,000 iterations. If a fixed random seed value was used during the training process, the same set of random events would be generated, and the resulting model would be the same across different runs.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, a possible strategy could be the use of a fixed random seed value during the training process. This can ensure reproducibility and comparability of the training results.
