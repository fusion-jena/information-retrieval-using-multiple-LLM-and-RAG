I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses a model for predicting real-world phenomena, such as wildfire spreads or pest plants propagation, using a cellular automaton and machine learning techniques. It also explains the limitations of the model as a classification model. However, there is no mention of where the data repository is available. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
