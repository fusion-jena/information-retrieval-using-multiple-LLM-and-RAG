The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not specified in the provided context. The text mentions the use of deep neural networks (DNNs) in the context of ecological prediction, but it does not specify whether these are convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), Transformers, or another type of DNN. CNNs are often used for image recognition tasks, RNNs for sequential data, and Transformers for natural language processing, but the context does not provide enough information to determine which of these (if any) was used.
