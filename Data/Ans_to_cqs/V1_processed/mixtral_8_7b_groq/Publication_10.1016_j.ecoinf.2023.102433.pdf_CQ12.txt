Based on the provided context, the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly stated. The text only mentions that deep learning analysis can be performed using Tensorflow, a popular open-source framework developed by Google. Tensorflow supports various types of deep learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Transformers. However, without further information, it is not possible to determine which of these models, if any, are used in the pipeline.
