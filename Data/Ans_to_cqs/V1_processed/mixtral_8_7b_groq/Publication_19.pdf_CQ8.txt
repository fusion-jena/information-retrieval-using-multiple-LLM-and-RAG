Unfortunately, the context provided does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in this research. The text focuses on the methodology, results, and applications of the system, but it does not mention where the code can be found. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query. If the code repository is available on a platform like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket, it would be helpful to include this information in the paper or related materials to facilitate reproducibility and further development of the system.
