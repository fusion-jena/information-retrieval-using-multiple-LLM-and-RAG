Based on the provided context, there is no information about which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model for downscaling near-surface wind fields to high-resolution topography in highly complex terrain. The paper by Dujardin and Lehning (2022) describes the development and evaluation of the deep learning model, but it does not mention the platform used for deployment. Similarly, the other papers do not provide any information about the deployment platform of the deep learning model in question. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
