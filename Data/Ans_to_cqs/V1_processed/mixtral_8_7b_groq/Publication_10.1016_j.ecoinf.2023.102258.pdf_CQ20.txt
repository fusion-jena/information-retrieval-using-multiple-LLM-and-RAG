In the provided context, it is mentioned that long audio files are usually divided into shorter chunks during training of deep learning models for machine learning systems. This is done to ensure that a whole batch can fit inside the limited memory of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Therefore, it can be inferred that GPUs are the primary hardware resource used for training deep learning models in this particular context.

It is worth noting that the context does not explicitly mention any other hardware resources, such as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), being used for training deep learning models. However, it is possible that TPUs or other hardware resources could be used in different contexts or for different machine learning systems.

In summary, based on the provided context, GPUs are the primary hardware resource used for training deep learning models in this particular machine learning system.
