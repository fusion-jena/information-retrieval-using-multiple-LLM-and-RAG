I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the TPEBO algorithm for hyperparameter optimization, its application in fine-tuning LSTM models, and its use in low-carbon economics and deep learning studies. However, it does not mention where the code for this pipeline is available. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to this query.
