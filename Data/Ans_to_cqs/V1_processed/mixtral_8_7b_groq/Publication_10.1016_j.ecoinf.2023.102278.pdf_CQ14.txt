The hyperparameters of the model are optimized by training several models on the insect TL (TLm) benchmark dataset to find the optimal value for the hyper-parameter α, which is chosen from the range of α ∈ [1.0⋅10−6, 1.0]. The models are trained with different values of α, and the one with the highest accuracy is selected. Although marginal changes in accuracy were observed for all levels, the study chose α = 0.5. However, the context does not provide information on the specific method used for searching the optimal value of α, such as grid search or random search.

Moreover, the study used ResNet50 and EfficientNetB3 models validated with multitask learning and pre-trained weights. The average and standard deviation of the precision, recall, and F1-score are presented in Table 4 for both models. The training was performed using data augmentation, including image scaling, horizontal and vertical flip, perspective distortion, and adding color jitter for brightness, contrast, and saturation. These techniques help mitigate overfitting by increasing the diversity of the training data.

The training used a batch size of 20 for faster updates and less noise than smaller batch sizes. The accuracy of the models on the training and validation datasets was computed after each epoch. However, the context does not provide information on the specific method used for optimizing other hyperparameters of the models.

Therefore, while the context provides information on the optimization of the hyper-parameter α and other training parameters, it does not explicitly mention the method used for optimizing the hyperparameters of the models.
