The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline for tree species classification include rotation, mirroring, and flipping. These techniques were performed on tree samples, which were in the form of patches, to increase the amount of tree species samples for training of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). By rotating, mirroring, and flipping the tree samples, the deep learning network was able to avoid distinguishing identical textures that only differed from each other by orientation changes. This data augmentation resulted in a total of 5664 tree samples used for CNN training. The study also used scattered samples and tree samples in 12 plots surveyed in the field measurements for test and tree species classification accuracy assessment, with a total of 931 test tree samples. These 12 plots were also used for diversity mapping assessment.
