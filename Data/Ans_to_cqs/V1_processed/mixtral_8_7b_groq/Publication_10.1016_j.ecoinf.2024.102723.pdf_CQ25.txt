The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the descriptions of the model's architecture and the references to related works, it can be inferred that the model is primarily used for regression problems.

The deep learning model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, and it consists of input and output layers, as well as hidden layers that differ in structure for two different architectures (MCD and VBI). The input layer has two nodes, one for DOY (Day of Year) and the other for GDD (Growing Degree Days), which suggests that the model may be used for predicting some growth-related variable in a plant or crop system.

The references to related works also provide some context for the potential use of the deep learning model. For example, the Dash et al. (2022) paper discusses techniques for including domain-knowledge into deep neural networks, which could be relevant for improving the accuracy and interpretability of the model for specific agricultural applications. The de Wit et al. (2019) paper describes the WOFOST cropping systems model, which is used for simulating crop growth and development, and could be a potential application area for the deep learning model.

Overall, while the specific purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context, it can be inferred that the model is used for regression problems related to plant or crop growth and development, and that it may be combined with domain-knowledge and other modeling techniques to improve its accuracy and interpretability for specific agricultural applications.
