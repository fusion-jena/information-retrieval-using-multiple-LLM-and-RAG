The provided context does not give information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It includes details about using data augmentation and the U-net convolutional network to improve results when identifying specific vegetation using UAV flights. It also mentions studies that have used deep learning for tasks such as corn plant counting and identifying various objects and plant species. However, there is no mention of where the data repository for any of these studies is available. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
