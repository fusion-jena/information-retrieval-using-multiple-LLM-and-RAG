The provided context does not include information on the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model. However, it does offer insights into data representation, visualization, and platform functionality that could be relevant when deploying such models.

For instance, node-based programming, as described in the context, is a method of data representation where each "node" accepts inputs, performs computations, and yields outputs. This concept could be useful in deploying a deep learning model if the platform being used supports this kind of architecture.

Moreover, the context highlights the importance of having a robust, community-driven ecosystem when using software platforms. Such an ecosystem can provide a wide range of functionalities and customization options, which could be beneficial during the deployment of a deep learning model.

In the context of soil information, which is not directly related to deep learning model deployment, there are frameworks and models developed to improve the understanding and presentation of soil data. These include the framework for preliminary delineation of soil profile horizons by Yang et al. (2022), the data exchange schema for soil and terrain data proposed by Pourabdollah et al. (2012), and the model linking landscape and soil profile evolution introduced by Temme and Vanwalleghem (2016). These examples show how research efforts are being made to improve the handling and interpretation of specific types of data.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not directly answer the query about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model, it does offer insights into data representation, visualization, and platform functionality that could be relevant during the deployment process.
