The provided context does not give information about the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It mainly focuses on the optimization of parameters for Land Trend Ridge (LTR) detection of wildfire-induced changes in vegetation.

The authors, Runge et al., have optimized the LTR model by adjusting two parameters: Maximum Segments (MS) and Recovery Threshold (RT). These parameters help in better capturing the index response to wildfire. The overall accuracy and kappa of the optimized parameters can improve by up to 8.4% and 36.8%, respectively, compared to the default parameters.

MS defines the maximum number of segments used for fitting, and RT defines the threshold for a fast recovery event. The context suggests that a simple disturbance-recovery pattern consists of four phases, and an MS value of 4 is appropriate for describing the temporal pattern. In complex recovery situations, more segments may be required. RT has a value between 0 and 1, where a higher value makes the model less likely to miss a fast recovery but more likely to cause a false positive error.

The authors have evaluated the accuracy of the LTR model using the kappa coefficient, which comprehensively evaluates the detection accuracy for different indices and parameter sets. The LTR model tends to have a larger omission error than commission error, meaning unburned pixels are less likely to be mistakenly identified as burned. However, the overall accuracy still maintains a high level because the unburned pixels can be accurately identified.

In summary, the provided context discusses the optimization of the LTR model for wildfire-induced vegetation change detection. However, it does not mention the specific deep learning model used in the pipeline.
