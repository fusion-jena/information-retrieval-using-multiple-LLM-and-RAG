Based on the provided context, there is no information given about the specific platform that was used to deploy the deep learning model. The context only mentions that big data theory and technology, neural networks, and other deep-level data mining methods were applied to understand the influence of forest microclimate on NAI. However, it does not specify the platform where these models were deployed. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
