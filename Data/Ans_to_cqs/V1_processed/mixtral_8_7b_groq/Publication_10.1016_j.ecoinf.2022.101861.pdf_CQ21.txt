Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about postprocessing steps involving saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix following model training. However, the text does mention some post-recording processing and statistical analysis of vocalizations in the study of a specific species. Here's a summary of those steps:

1. Signal parameter extraction: After recording the vocalizations, the system extracted all sounds that satisfied specific signal parameters, such as minimum and maximum length, and a maximum inter-syllable gap of 4 seconds.

2. Factors consideration: During the statistical analysis, recording month and site were taken into account as factors.

3. Data cleaning: Months with less than 100 vocalizations (from December to March) were not included in the analyses.

4. Post-hoc tests: Tukey's post-hoc tests were performed to identify differences among levels of the factors recording hour and recording month.

5. Software and packages: Statistical analyses were run using R 3.6.2, and the "multcomp" package was used for Tukey's post-hoc tests.

It is important to note that these steps are specific to the study mentioned in the context and do not directly relate to the query about postprocessing steps following model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.


The provided context does not include information on postprocessing steps like saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix following model training. It mainly discusses post-recording processing and statistical analysis of vocalizations in a specific study, which involves signal parameter extraction, factors consideration, data cleaning, and post-hoc tests.
