The provided context does not give specific information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, it does mention some methods used in the studies that can contribute to the generalizability of models in machine learning and data analysis.

First, the use of a diverse dataset can help improve the generalizability of a model. In the context, there are studies that use various datasets from different fields, such as water resources, civil engineering, and signal classification. For example, Chen et al. (2023) studied the pattern of spatially compounding drought and pluvial events over eastern China, while Uncuoglu et al. (2022) compared various methods for solving civil engineering problems. Using a diverse dataset can help the model learn more patterns and relationships in the data, which can improve its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

Second, cross-validation is a common technique used to assess the performance and generalizability of a model. In cross-validation, the dataset is divided into several subsets, or folds, and the model is trained and tested on different combinations of these folds. This process helps to reduce overfitting and gives a more reliable estimate of the model's performance on new data. Although cross-validation is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, some studies use a specified number of iterations or a genetic programming approach, which can include cross-validation as a part of the process.

Third, stratified splitting is another technique that can help improve the generalizability of a model. Stratified splitting ensures that the subsets of the dataset have a similar distribution of the target variable or other important factors. This can help to ensure that the training and testing subsets are representative of the overall dataset and that the model's performance is not biased by the distribution of the data. However, the provided context does not mention the use of stratified splitting in any of the studies.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not give specific information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, it does mention some methods used in the studies that can contribute to the generalizability of models in machine learning and data analysis, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, and stratified splitting.
