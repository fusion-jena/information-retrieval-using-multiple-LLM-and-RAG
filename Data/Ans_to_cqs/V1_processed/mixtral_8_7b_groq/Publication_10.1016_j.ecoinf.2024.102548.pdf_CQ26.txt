The provided context discusses various aspects of a deep learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, model architecture, and training, but it does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. However, it does discuss data augmentation and stratified splitting, which can be used to mitigate certain types of data bias.

Data augmentation (as mentioned in section 4.3) is a technique that can increase the diversity of the training data by generating artificial variations of the existing samples. This can help reduce overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data. In the context of addressing data bias, data augmentation can be used to create synthetic samples that better represent underrepresented classes or groups in the dataset. For example, if one class in a binary classification problem has significantly fewer samples than the other, data augmentation can be used to generate additional synthetic samples for the underrepresented class.

Stratified splitting (implied in Table 1) is a method for splitting a dataset into training, testing, and validation sets while preserving the original dataset's class distribution. This technique can help ensure that each subset contains a representative sample of all classes, reducing the likelihood of bias arising from an imbalanced distribution. In the Okra Leaves dataset example, the training, testing, and validation sets for both diseased and healthy okra leaves are stratified, ensuring that each subset has a similar proportion of healthy and diseased leaves.

While the context does not explicitly mention oversampling or undersampling techniques, these methods can also be used to address data bias by adjusting the class distribution in the training dataset. Oversampling involves creating additional copies of the minority class samples, while undersampling reduces the number of majority class samples. Both techniques aim to balance the class distribution and can help reduce bias in the model's learning process.

In summary, the provided context discusses data augmentation and stratified splitting, which can be used to address data bias during preprocessing. Data augmentation can increase the diversity of the training data, while stratified splitting maintains the original dataset's class distribution during splitting. Additionally, oversampling and undersampling techniques can be employed to balance the class distribution in the training dataset, further reducing data bias.
