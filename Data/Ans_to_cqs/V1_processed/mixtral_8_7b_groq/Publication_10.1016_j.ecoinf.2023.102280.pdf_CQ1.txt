The provided context does not give specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for noise reduction techniques in bioacoustics. However, it does mention that clean data is collected for training purposes and noise profiles are superimposed to provide both the input data and a "denoised" ground truth. It also states that collecting clean recordings can be infeasible and requires the recording of captive animals which may not be representative of the wider population.

In general, raw data for deep learning models can be collected through various methods such as surveys, sensors, and public datasets. Surveys can include data collection through manual recordings by researchers in the field. Sensors can include automated recording devices set up in specific environments to capture data over a period of time. Public datasets can also be used, which are often available for research purposes in various domains, including audio data.

In the context of bioacoustics, the provided context suggests that collecting clean recordings can be challenging, and generating training data for fine-tuning can also be difficult due to the sparsity of vocalisations. Therefore, alternative methods for generating training data may be required, such as using synthetic data or data augmentation techniques.

Overall, while the provided context does not give specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for noise reduction techniques in bioacoustics, it is likely that a combination of methods such as surveys, sensors, and public datasets can be used, with a focus on generating clean and representative training data for the specific application.
