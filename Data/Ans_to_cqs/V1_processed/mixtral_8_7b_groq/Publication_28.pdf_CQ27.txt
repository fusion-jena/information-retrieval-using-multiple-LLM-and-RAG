The context does not provide specific information on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does give some insights into the training process of the model.

The deep learning model in question is a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that is used for satellite image classification. The training process of this model involves an unsupervised pre-training step and a supervised fine-tuning step. In the unsupervised pre-training step, the VAE model is trained on the satellite images to learn the network parameters using the Backpropagation (BP) technique. This technique involves stochastic gradient descent on the Backpropagation algorithm, which is used to manage stochastic input. The solution is named as the "reparameterization trick," which transfers the sampling to the input layer.

The VAE model comprises an input layer, various Autoencoders (AEs), and an output layer. The AE is a type of neural network that is trained to replace the input with the output. It includes a hidden layer h to define a code used for input representation. The VAE is a directed network that makes use of learned approximate inferences and undergoes training using gradient approaches.

Once the model is trained, it can be deployed for satellite image classification. The context does not provide specific information on how the trained model is deployed. However, some possible ways to deploy a deep learning model include model serialization and platform selection.

Model serialization involves saving the trained model in a file format that can be easily loaded and used for making predictions. Common file formats for model serialization include HDF5, JSON, and XML. Once the model is serialized, it can be deployed on a platform that can load and use the model for making predictions.

Platform selection involves choosing a platform that can host and run the deep learning model. Common platforms for deep learning model deployment include cloud-based platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP), as well as on-premises platforms such as servers and workstations.

In summary, while the context does not provide specific information on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, it does provide insights into the training process of the model. Once the model is trained, it can be deployed using model serialization and platform selection.
