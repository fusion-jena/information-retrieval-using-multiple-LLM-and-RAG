Based on the provided context, the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly stated. However, we can infer that the data used in this study is likely in the form of tabular data or point data, as suggested by the use of terms such as "CSV," "feature class," "regularization multiplier," and "environmental variables."

The authors mention using a "feature class" as one of the parameters in their model, which suggests that they are using some form of tabular data. Additionally, the use of a "regularization multiplier" implies that they are working with numerical data.

Furthermore, the context includes several numerical values and percentages, which suggests that the data used in this study is likely to be in a format that can be easily analyzed using statistical methods.

However, it is important to note that the provided context only describes one specific study, and the data formats used in other deep learning pipelines may differ.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly state the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, we can infer that the data is likely in the form of tabular or point data, based on the use of terms such as "CSV," "feature class," and "regularization multiplier."
