The specific deep learning frameworks used to build the models in the given context are not explicitly mentioned. However, based on the models and techniques used, we can make some educated guesses.

The models used include VGG16, Inception V3, MobileNet V2, ResNet 50, DenseNet 121, Xception, PCA Based VGG16, and a Proposed Approach. VGG16, Inception V3, MobileNet V2, ResNet 50, Xception, and PCA Based VGG16 are models that are available in the Keras library, which is built on top of TensorFlow. DenseNet 121 is also available in Keras, and by extension, TensorFlow. Therefore, it is highly likely that TensorFlow was used as the deep learning framework for these models.

The Proposed Approach is not explicitly defined, but it is compared with other models in Table 9. Given that it achieves the highest accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, it is possible that this model was also built using TensorFlow or another deep learning framework like PyTorch. However, without more information, it is impossible to say for certain.

In summary, while the specific deep learning framework used to build the models in the given context is not explicitly stated, it is highly likely that TensorFlow was used given the models that are mentioned.
