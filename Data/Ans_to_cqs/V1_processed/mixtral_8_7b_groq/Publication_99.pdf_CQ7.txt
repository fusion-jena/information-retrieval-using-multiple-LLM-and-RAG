The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the data is split into training and validation sets, as the models were evaluated using the validation set during training.

In the case of the PConv networks, models were trained for 50 epochs, and for each training epoch, a model was evaluated using the validation set and saved as the best model based on a validation loss. Similarly, for the classification networks, the performance of the models was evaluated on a validation set, but the number of epochs and the specific evaluation criteria were not provided.

It is a common practice in deep learning to split the data into three sets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune the hyperparameters and evaluate the model during training, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final model's performance.

The validation set is used to provide an unbiased evaluation of the model during training, as it allows the model to be evaluated on data that it has not seen before. This helps to prevent overfitting, which occurs when the model becomes too specialized to the training data and performs poorly on new data.

Therefore, while the specific criteria used to split the data in the provided context are not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that the data was split into training and validation sets, and possibly a testing set, to evaluate the model's performance.
