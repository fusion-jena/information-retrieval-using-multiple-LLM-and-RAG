Based on the information provided, there is no explicit mention of the data repository where the deep learning pipeline's data is available. The text describes a study involving transfer learning and data augmentation techniques for classifying diseased and healthy okra leaves. However, it does not specify the data repository where the images of okra leaves used in this study are stored.

The dataset is divided into training, testing, and validation sets for diseased and healthy okra leaves, as shown in Table 1. The figures also illustrate examples of diseased and healthy okra leaves. However, the source of these images and where they can be accessed for reuse or further analysis is not provided in the text.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It would be best to contact the authors or look for additional information in the related work or references cited in the article.
