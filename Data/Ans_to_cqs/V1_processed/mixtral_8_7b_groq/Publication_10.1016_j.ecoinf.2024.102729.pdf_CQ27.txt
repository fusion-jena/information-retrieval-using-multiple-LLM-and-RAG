Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model. However, I can describe a general process that is often used to deploy deep learning models in water quality management or similar fields.

First, the deep learning model is trained using a suitable framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Once the model is trained, it is important to save it in a format that can be easily loaded later. This process is called model serialization. Model serialization can be done using various methods provided by the deep learning framework. For example, in TensorFlow, you can save the model using the `save()` method, which saves the model architecture, weights, and other necessary information in a single file or a directory containing multiple files.

After serialization, the model needs to be deployed on a platform where it can be used to make predictions on new data. The choice of platform depends on the specific requirements of the application. For example, if the model needs to be deployed on a mobile device or an edge computing device, then a lightweight platform such as TensorFlow Lite or PyTorch Mobile would be more suitable. On the other hand, if the model needs to be deployed on a server or a cloud platform, then a more robust platform such as TensorFlow Serving or AWS SageMaker would be more appropriate.

Once the platform is selected, the serialized model is loaded onto the platform and integrated with the necessary input/output interfaces. This may involve writing additional code to preprocess the input data, format the output predictions, and handle any errors or exceptions that may occur during the deployment process.

In summary, the general process for deploying a trained deep learning model involves model serialization, platform selection, and integration with input/output interfaces. However, the specific details of this process may vary depending on the requirements of the application and the deep learning framework used.
