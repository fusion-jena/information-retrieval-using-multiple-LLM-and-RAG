The provided context does not offer specific information about the purpose of the deep learning model in this particular study. However, deep learning models are often used for various tasks such as classification, segmentation, object detection, and prediction, among others. The choice of task depends on the problem at hand and the desired output. For instance, in the context of image data, deep learning can be used for image classification (identifying what object is in an image), segmentation (separating different parts or objects within an image), or object detection (identifying and locating objects within an image). In the context of the provided information, the deep learning model could potentially be used for any of these tasks, but the specific purpose is not mentioned.
