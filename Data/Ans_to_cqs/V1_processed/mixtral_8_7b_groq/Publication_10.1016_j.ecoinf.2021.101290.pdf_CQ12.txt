Based on the provided context, there is no specific deep learning model mentioned in the pipeline. The text discusses the use of machine learning and deep learning techniques in general, and the importance of high-quality data for automated annotation and analysis. It also mentions the use of various tools and platforms for event-stream processing and data analysis, such as AWS kinesis, Apache Kibana, and elasticsearch. However, it does not specify which deep learning model is being used in the proposed architecture. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
