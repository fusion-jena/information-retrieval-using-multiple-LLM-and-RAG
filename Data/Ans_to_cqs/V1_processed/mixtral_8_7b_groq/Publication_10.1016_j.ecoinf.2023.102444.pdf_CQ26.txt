The text provided does not directly discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some preprocessing techniques related to dimensionality reduction and data visualization.

In the context of deep learning for species distribution modeling, Deneu et al. (2022) used tSNE, a dimensionality reduction method (DRM), to visualize input data and model results. Similarly, the authors of the EcologicalInformatics79(2
