Based on the provided context, the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation) are not mentioned. However, I can provide some general guidance on how to split the data for such a purpose.

When preparing data for a deep learning model, it is common to split the dataset into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. This practice helps ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data and prevents overfitting. Here are some guidelines for splitting the data:

1. Training set: This set is used to train the model's parameters. Typically, it consists of about 70-80% of the total data.

2. Validation set: This set is used to tune hyperparameters, such as learning rate or regularization strength. The validation set helps assess the model's performance during the training phase and guides the selection of the best set of hyperparameters. It usually consists of about 10-15% of the total data.

3. Testing set: This set is used to evaluate the final model's performance. It should be independent of both the training and validation sets. The testing set helps assess how well the model generalizes to unseen data. It typically consists of about 10-15% of the total data.

In the context of the provided information, if the dataset consists of historical and near real-time data from different SRS products, such as Sentinel-3, VIIRS, or MODIS, one possible approach could be to split the data based on time or location. For example:

- Time-based split: Divide the data based on different time periods, such as using older data for training, more recent data for validation, and the most recent data for testing.
- Location-based split: Divide the data based on different geographical regions, such as using data from one region for training, another region for validation, and a third region for testing.

However, the specific criteria for splitting the data should be determined based on the problem at hand and the available data. It is essential to ensure that the splits are representative of the overall dataset and do not introduce any biases that could affect the model's performance.
