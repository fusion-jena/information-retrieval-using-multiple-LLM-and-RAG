Based on the provided context, the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned. However, it is stated that data augmentation was applied to the training dataset and involved creating segments from the original recordings. These segments were then randomly distributed between the training and validation sets.

Although the techniques are not specified, common data augmentation techniques for audio data include time-shifting, pitch-shifting, and adding background noise. Time-shifting involves shifting the audio segments along the time axis, which can help the model learn to recognize the same sound at different time intervals. Pitch-shifting involves changing the pitch of the audio segments, which can help the model learn to recognize the same sound at different frequencies. Adding background noise can help the model learn to recognize the sound of interest in different environments.

It's important to note that the choice of data augmentation techniques depends on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the problem being addressed. Therefore, the techniques used in this study may differ from those used in other studies.
