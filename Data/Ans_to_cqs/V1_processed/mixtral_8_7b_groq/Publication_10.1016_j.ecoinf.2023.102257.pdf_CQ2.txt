Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline in the described study uses image data format. The study focuses on the use of modern machine learning methods, including deep learning techniques, to determine the presence of animals in camera trap images and filter out false detections. The methods used include the measurement of differences between consecutive images, convolutional neural networks, and ensemble learning. These techniques are applied to image data to predict whether an image is empty or not and to localize target objects (animals) within an image. Therefore, the data format used in this deep learning pipeline is image data.
