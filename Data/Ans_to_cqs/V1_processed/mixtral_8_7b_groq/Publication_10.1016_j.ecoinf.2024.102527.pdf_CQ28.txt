The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform) used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the deep learning environment utilized was PyTorch 1.7.1 and the computing platform was a Dell PowerEdge C4130 rack server with two Tesla K80 GPUs and 256 GB of memory. So, it can be inferred that the model was likely deployed on-premises on this server, rather than in a cloud-based platform.
