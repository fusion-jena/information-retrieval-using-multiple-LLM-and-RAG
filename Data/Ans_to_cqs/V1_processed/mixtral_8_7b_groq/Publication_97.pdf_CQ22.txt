The performance of the deep learning model, specifically the U-Net-like convolutional neural network (CNN) for forest damage segmentation, is evaluated using two metrics: overall accuracy score and mean intersection over union (MeanIoU).

The overall accuracy score is computed as the fraction of correctly classified pixels to their total number. This metric provides a general understanding of the model's performance. However, it might not be representative in cases where there is a class imbalance, which is common in pixel-wise classification problems.

To handle class-imbalanced cases, the MeanIoU metric is used. MeanIoU is the mean of the intersection over union (IoU) for all classes. IoU is the ratio of the intersection of the predicted and true classes to their union. MeanIoU allows for a more nuanced evaluation of the model's performance, particularly in cases where classes are not equally represented.

The MeanIoU metric is computed using the MeanIoU function from the Keras package. For each threshold value in the interval [0.5, 1) with a step of 0.05, MeanIoU values are computed and stored in an array. The final average value of MeanIoU is then computed.

These metrics, overall accuracy score and MeanIoU, are used to tune the architecture of the U-Net-like CNN by performing a grid search over different architectures. The best architecture corresponds to the configuration where the number of layers is equal to 64, and dropout is applied. The best result is obtained when batch normalization is also applied, resulting in the following parameters: num_layers = 64, depth = 4, layer_rate = 2, batch_norm = True, residual = False, dropout = 0.5.

In summary, the performance of the U-Net-like CNN for forest damage segmentation is evaluated using the overall accuracy score and the MeanIoU metric. These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance, particularly in handling class-imbalanced cases, which are common in pixel-wise classification problems.
