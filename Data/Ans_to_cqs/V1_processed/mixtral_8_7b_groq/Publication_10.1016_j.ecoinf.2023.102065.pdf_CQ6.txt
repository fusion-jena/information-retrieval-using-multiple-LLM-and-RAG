The provided context discusses the preprocessing steps related to the use of sound data for training deep learning models, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, it does not explicitly mention the normalization, scaling, or cleaning processes that are often involved in preprocessing data for deep learning models.

In the context, the preprocessing steps for sound data include the conversion of sound data into mel-spectrograms, which are a type of 2D image spectrogram. Mel-spectrograms represent the frequency, amplitude, and temporal information of sound data in a way that is more suitable for CNNs to process.

The preprocessing of mel-spectrograms involves adjusting the weights of each of the three CNN models using training and validation XC mel-spectrograms. Pre-training with XC data is applied to all CNN models, starting with training the final, dense layer for 10 epochs followed by training all layers for 10 additional epochs.

After pre-training, fine-tuning is applied to both the default CNN backbones and the XC pre-trained CNNs using the ROI training and validation mel-spectrograms. The fine-tuning process consists of two stages: (1) model training on the classifier only, freezing all other trainable parameters in CNN layers for 10 epochs, and (2) fine-tuning all layers with a lower learning rate.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention normalization, scaling, or cleaning, it does describe the conversion of sound data into mel-spectrograms and the adjustment of CNN model weights using training and validation data as part of the preprocessing process.
