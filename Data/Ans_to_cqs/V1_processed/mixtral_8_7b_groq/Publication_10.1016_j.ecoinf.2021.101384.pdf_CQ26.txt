The text provided does not directly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss how a workflow can compensate for biases in data through data classification and spatio-temporal aggregation, mainly when large input datasets are used. It also highlights the importance of having a large amount of statistically significant data and using the most appropriate spatial resolution for the analysis to increase the precision of the workflow's output.

In the context of deep learning, there are several techniques that can be used to address data bias during the preprocessing stage. These techniques include:

1. Stratified sampling: This technique involves dividing the data into subgroups based on certain characteristics, such as class labels, and then ensuring that each subgroup is proportionally represented in both the training and testing datasets.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of instances of the minority class in the training dataset to balance it with the majority class.
3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class in the training dataset to balance it with the minority class.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from a variety of sources and ensuring that the data is representative of the population being studied.

These techniques can help to ensure that the training data is balanced and representative, which can improve the performance of the deep learning model and reduce bias in the predictions. It is worth noting that the choice of technique will depend on the specific characteristics of the data and the problem being solved.
