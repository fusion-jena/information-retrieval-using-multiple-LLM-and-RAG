The deep learning model in question is used for semantic segmentation, specifically for the purpose of constructing soil salinity maps. This is achieved by assigning a category label to each pixel of an image, thereby enabling the detection and segmentation of soil salinity and vegetation. The model is a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the U-NET method, which has been successfully employed in various remote sensing image classification-related tasks. In this study, the original 5-band multispectral image was enhanced with the addition of five salinity indices, resulting in a total of seven bands. The proposed deep learning model, MU-NET, was then trained and tested using a combination of these images and ground truth images. The model is designed as a pixel-based deep learning segmentation architecture.

To summarize, the deep learning model serves the purpose of semantic segmentation for soil salinity mapping in remote sensing applications. It is a modified U-NET model that has been trained and tested using a 7-band image dataset, with the goal of accurately detecting and segmenting soil salinity and vegetation.
