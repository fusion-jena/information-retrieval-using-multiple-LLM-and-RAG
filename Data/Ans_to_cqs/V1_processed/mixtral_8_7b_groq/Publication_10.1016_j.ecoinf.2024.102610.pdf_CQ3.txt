Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for predicting infectious diseases. However, I can provide some general information about common data annotation techniques in deep learning.

In the context of computer vision and image analysis, data annotation techniques are crucial for training deep learning models. These techniques help in labeling the data so that the model can learn to identify and classify objects or regions of interest. Here are some common data annotation techniques:

1. Image-level annotation: In this technique, the entire image is labeled with a single class. For instance, an image can be annotated as 'healthy' or 'infected' without specifying the exact location of the infection. This method is useful when the goal is to classify images instead of identifying specific objects or regions.

2. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing a bounding box around the object of interest in an image. It helps the model to learn the spatial extent and location of the object. For example, in medical imaging, bounding boxes can be used to annotate infected regions or lesions.

3. Semantic segmentation: Semantic segmentation is the process of partitioning an image into multiple segments or regions, where each region corresponds to a specific class. It provides pixel-level annotations, enabling the model to understand the spatial distribution of classes within an image.

4. Instance segmentation: Instance segmentation is an extension of semantic segmentation, where each instance of an object is segmented and labeled individually. This method is useful when there are multiple instances of the same object in an image, and it is essential to differentiate between them.

5. Landmark annotation: Landmark annotation involves identifying and labeling specific points or landmarks on an object within an image. It can be useful for tasks like facial recognition or tracking the movement of objects.

Based on the context, the study by Keshavamurthy et al. (2022) focuses on machine learning and deep learning approaches for predicting infectious diseases. However, it does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used in their deep learning pipeline.
