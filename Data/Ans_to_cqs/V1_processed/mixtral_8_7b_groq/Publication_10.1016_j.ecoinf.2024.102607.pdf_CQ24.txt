The text provided does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. However, it does mention the use of random forests, an ensemble learning method, in the context of land use/cover (LULC) mapping. Random forests incorporate randomness in their algorithm by using a different subset of the training data for each decision tree in the forest, which helps to reduce overfitting and improve the model's generalization ability.

In the context of deep learning, there are several strategies to handle randomness in the pipeline. One common method is using a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results. This is important for scientific research and model debugging, as it allows for consistent results to be obtained when running the same code.

Another way to handle randomness is through data augmentation, where random transformations are applied to the training data to increase its size and diversity. This can help improve the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

Regularization techniques, such as dropout and weight decay, can also be used to handle randomness in deep learning models. Dropout randomly sets a fraction of the model's weights to zero during training, which helps prevent overfitting and improves the model's ability to generalize. Weight decay, on the other hand, adds a penalty term to the loss function that encourages the model to learn smaller weights, which can help prevent overfitting and improve the model's interpretability.

In addition, techniques such as early stopping and model ensembling can be used to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines. Early stopping involves stopping the training process before the model starts to overfit, while model ensembling involves combining the predictions of multiple models to improve the overall performance and reduce the impact of randomness.

Overall, while the text provided does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, there are several well-established methods that can be used to manage randomness in deep learning models. These include using a fixed random seed value, data augmentation, regularization techniques, early stopping, and model ensembling.
