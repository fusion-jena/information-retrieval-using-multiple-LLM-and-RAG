Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps taken after the model training. However, the context does mention the use of the MaxEnt model for output analysis and the calculation of the relative contributions of environmental and territorial variables.

The MaxEnt model is a popular machine learning algorithm used for species distribution modeling. After training the model, there are several common postprocessing steps that are often taken to further analyze and interpret the model's output. Here are some examples of these postprocessing steps:

1. Saliency maps: Saliency maps are a way to visualize the importance of different input variables in predicting the presence of a species. These maps can help identify the most influential factors in the model and provide insights into the underlying ecological processes.
2. Metrics calculation: After training the model, various metrics can be calculated to evaluate its performance. These metrics can include the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics can help assess the model's ability to predict the presence of a species and provide a basis for comparison with other models.
3. Confusion matrix: A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification model. It compares the predicted values with the actual values and provides information on false positives, false negatives, true positives, and true negatives. This information can be used to calculate additional metrics, such as sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value.
4. Model validation: Model validation is an important step in the postprocessing process. It involves testing the model on a separate dataset that was not used during training. This can help ensure that the model is not overfitting to the training data and can generalize well to new data.
5. Variable importance analysis: The provided context mentions the calculation of the relative contributions of environmental and territorial variables. This is a form of variable importance analysis that can help identify the most important factors in the model.

Based on the provided context, it is likely that some of these postprocessing steps were taken after training the MaxEnt model. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
