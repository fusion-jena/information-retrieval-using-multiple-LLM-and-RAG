Based on the provided context, specific details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model are not given. However, it is mentioned that deep learning has been successfully applied to automate wildlife monitoring using UAV images. Different networks such as RetinaNet, Faster R-CNN, and YOLOv5 have been used to detect and classify various wildlife species.

Assuming a typical deep learning model deployment process, we can infer that the trained model would have been serialized to save its state and parameters. Model serialization is an essential step in deep learning model deployment, as it allows the model to be saved in a format that can be easily loaded and used for making predictions. Common model serialization formats include HDF5, JSON, and Protocol Buffers.

Once the model is serialized, it would need to be deployed on a platform that can handle the predictions. The platform selection would depend on the specific use case and the resources available. For instance, the trained deep learning model could be deployed on a local machine, a cloud platform, or an edge device such as a UAV.

In the case of UAV-based wildlife monitoring, the trained deep learning model would likely be deployed on the UAV itself or on a ground station that receives the UAV's images. The deployment platform would need to be able to handle real-time image processing and have sufficient computational resources to run the deep learning model.

Therefore, while the specific details of the model deployment process are not provided in the context, we can infer that the trained deep learning model would have been serialized and deployed on a suitable platform, such as a UAV or ground station, for real-time image processing and wildlife monitoring.
