Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, there are some indications of techniques that could contribute to the model's generalizability.

First, the authors mentioned that they trained a Siamese network using fewer samples, which is related to few-shot learning. Few-shot learning is a method that can help improve the model's generalizability by enabling it to learn from a small number of examples and then generalize to new, unseen classes (Wang et al., 2020). In this study, the authors used two-way one-shot learning for training the tracking tasks, which could potentially enhance the model's ability to generalize to new data.

Second, the authors employed a refinement module that integrated a relation detector into the Siamese framework. This module aimed to suppress false-positive detections and filter background interference. By reducing false positives and focusing on relevant features, the model could potentially become more robust and generalize better to new data.

Third, the study used three different video datasets (6, 9, and 10) for training and testing the model. Although the context does not explicitly mention cross-validation or stratified splitting, using multiple datasets could implicitly serve a similar purpose. By testing the model on various video datasets, the authors could assess its performance across different scenarios and improve its generalizability.

Lastly, the authors stated that data will be made available on request. This transparency could potentially allow other researchers to evaluate the model's generalizability using their own datasets or experimental setups.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, there are indications of techniques that could contribute to its generalizability, such as few-shot learning, a refinement module, and the use of multiple video datasets for training and testing.
