Deep learning models can handle various data formats, including image, audio, video, and CSV files. The choice of data format depends on the specific deep learning method and the problem being addressed.

Image data is commonly used in deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for tasks like image classification, object detection, and segmentation. Image data is typically represented as multi-dimensional arrays, where each element corresponds to a pixel value.

Audio data is used in deep learning models for tasks like speech recognition, music generation, and emotion detection. Audio data is typically represented as time-series data, where each data point corresponds to a sound wave amplitude at a particular time.

Video data is used in deep learning models for tasks like action recognition, object tracking, and video summarization. Video data is typically represented as a sequence of frames, where each frame is an image.

CSV files are used in deep learning models for tasks like time-series prediction, natural language processing, and regression analysis. CSV files contain tabular data, where each row corresponds to a data point, and each column corresponds to a feature.

In the context of the provided pieces of information, the SLSTM method is used for time-series prediction, specifically for forecasting air pollution data. The SLSTM model takes in sequential data, which can be represented as a CSV file, where each row corresponds to a time point and each column corresponds to a feature.

In summary, deep learning models can handle various data formats, including image, audio, video, and CSV files. The choice of data format depends on the specific deep learning method and the problem being addressed. In the context of the provided pieces of information, the SLSTM method is used for time-series prediction, specifically for forecasting air pollution data, and takes in sequential data represented as a CSV file.
