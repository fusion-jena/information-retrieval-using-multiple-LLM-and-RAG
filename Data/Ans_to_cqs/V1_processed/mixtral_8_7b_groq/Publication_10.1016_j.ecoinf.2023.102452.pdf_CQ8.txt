Based on the provided context, there is no information about a specific deep learning pipeline and its code repository. The context includes several papers and sources that discuss various topics related to machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data-driven modeling, but none of them mention a deep learning pipeline and its code repository on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.

An example of a paper that uses machine learning but does not provide a code repository is "Genetic programming for interpretable and explainable machine learning" by Hu, T. (2023). This paper discusses the use of genetic programming for machine learning but does not mention any code repository.

Another paper that discusses machine learning is "A spatial non-stationary based site selection of artificial groundwater recharge: a case study for semi-arid regions" by Karamouz, M., Teymoori, J., Olyaei, M. (2021). This paper uses machine learning techniques for site selection but does not provide any information about a deep learning pipeline or its code repository.

Therefore, I cannot provide the code repository of the deep learning pipeline as it is not mentioned in the given context.
