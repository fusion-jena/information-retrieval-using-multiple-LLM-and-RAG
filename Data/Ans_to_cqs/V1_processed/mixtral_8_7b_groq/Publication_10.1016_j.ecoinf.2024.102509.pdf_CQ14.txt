The context does not explicitly mention the method used to optimize the hyperparameters of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. However, it is mentioned that hyperparameter tuning was carried out to ensure the reliability of the ANN models. There are various methods for hyperparameter tuning, including grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization.

Grid search involves creating a grid of hyperparameter values and training the model with each combination of hyperparameters in the grid. This method is exhaustive and can be computationally expensive, especially if the number of hyperparameters and the range of possible values for each hyperparameter are large.

Random search is a more efficient alternative to grid search. In random search, a subset of hyperparameter values is randomly sampled from the grid, and the model is trained with each sampled combination. This method can be more efficient than grid search because it is less likely to get stuck in local optima.

Bayesian optimization is a more sophisticated method for hyperparameter tuning. This method uses a probabilistic model to estimate the performance of the model for different combinations of hyperparameters. The probabilistic model is updated after each training run, and the next combination of hyperparameters to be tested is chosen based on the estimated performance.

Without further information, it is not possible to determine which method was used to optimize the hyperparameters of the ANN model in the given context. However, it is clear that hyperparameter tuning was carried out to ensure the reliability of the ANN models.
