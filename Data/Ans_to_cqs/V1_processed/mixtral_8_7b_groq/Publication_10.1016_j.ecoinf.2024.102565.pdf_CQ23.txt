To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken, including the use of a diverse dataset, cross-validation, and stratified splitting. 

Firstly, the dataset was extracted and divided into four mutually exclusive folds through stratified sampling. Stratified sampling ensures that each fold is a representative sample of the entire dataset, maintaining a balanced distribution of classes across all folds. This method is particularly useful in addressing class imbalance, which can significantly affect the performance of machine learning models.

Secondly, a K-fold cross-validation technique was implemented, with K set to four. This approach allowed for the comprehensive integration of both on-site and remote sensing (RS) datasets into both the training and validation phases. Unlike traditional methods that segregate data into distinct sets, this technique maximized data utilization, enhancing the robustness of the model training process. The model underwent training using a balanced three-fold training dataset, and was tested on a validation fold to generate predictions. This process iterated four times with distinct validation sets.

Thirdly, to further ensure the generalizability of the model, random under-sampling (RUS) was applied to the training set to address imbalances. The validation set remained unchanged. This method ensures that the model is trained on a balanced dataset, preventing it from being biased towards the majority class.

Lastly, the deep learning model used in this study is a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), which offers both point estimates and insights into prediction uncertainty. This feature allows for a better understanding of the model's predictions, further enhancing its generalizability.

In conclusion, the use of a diverse dataset, cross-validation, stratified splitting, and the implementation of a balanced training process through RUS, all contribute to ensuring the generalizability of the deep learning model.
