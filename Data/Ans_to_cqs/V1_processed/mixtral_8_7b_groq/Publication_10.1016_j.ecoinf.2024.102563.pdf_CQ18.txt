Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, we can infer that the performance of different classification models was evaluated using overall accuracy and kappa index after the training process was completed.

In the study by Duan et al. (Ecological Informatics 81(2024)1025635), four classification methods, namely MLC, SVM, ANN, and RF, were used to classify land cover using a 19 × 19 window size for the mean parameter. The performance of these models was evaluated based on overall accuracy and kappa index, which are common metrics used to assess the performance of classification models.

Similarly, in another study by Saboori et al. (Int. J. Remote Sens. 40 (2019) 8608–8634), MLC and ANN classification algorithms were used to extract urban land uses by combining multi-scale textural features from the panchromatic bands of high spatial resolution images. The performance of these models was evaluated based on overall accuracy and kappa coefficient.

In the study by Liu et al. (Geoderma 357 (2020) 1–9), a graded proportion method of training sample selection was proposed for updating conventional soil maps. Although the study did not explicitly mention the performance evaluation metrics used, it can be inferred that accuracy metrics were used to assess the performance of the proposed method.

Therefore, while there is no explicit information provided about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training, it can be inferred that the performance of the trained models was evaluated based on overall accuracy and kappa index or other accuracy metrics after the training process was completed.
