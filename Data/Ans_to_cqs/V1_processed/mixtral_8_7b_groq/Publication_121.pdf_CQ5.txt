The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline described in the context are Flavia and LeafSnap. The Flavia dataset was used in four of the models being compared, while the LeafSnap dataset was used in three of the models. The Flavia dataset contains 14,163 images of leaves from 32 different tree species, and the LeafSnap dataset contains 32,503 images of leaves from 185 tree species. These datasets were used for training and testing the models based on MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3, which were pre-trained on 1.4 million images from 1000 classes from the ImageNet dataset. The models were then fine-tuned and used as feature extractors for plant and tree species recognition. The Flavia and LeafSnap datasets were divided into training and test sets, with a ratio of 75:25, and the models were trained on the training sets using the TensorFlow, OpenCV-python3, and Keras libraries. The pre-trained weight parameters were obtained by building the base models from MobileNetV2, MobileNetV3-Large, and MobileNetV3-Small.
