Based on the provided context, there is no information about the specific hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. The context focuses on biodiversity data and ecological informatics, without mentioning any details about the computational resources used for training machine learning models.

However, when working with deep learning models, especially for large-scale data analysis, it is common to use Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) to accelerate the training process. GPUs and TPUs are specialized hardware designed to handle parallel computations, which is essential for deep learning models that require a large number of matrix and vector operations.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training a deep learning model, it is common practice to use GPUs or TPUs for such tasks due to their ability to handle parallel computations efficiently.
