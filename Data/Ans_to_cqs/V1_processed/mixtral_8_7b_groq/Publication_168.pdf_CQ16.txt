The criteria used to determine when training is complete in the context provided is not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred that the training process is performed until the model's performance on a separate test set is evaluated.

In the paper, the authors split the labeled pixels of the UAV hyperspectral image into a training set and a test set with a ratio of 1:9. The training samples were used to learn the weights and biases of the network, and the test samples are used to evaluate the classification performance.

The evaluation of the classification performance is based on three criteria: average accuracy (AA), overall accuracy (OA), and kappa coefficient (K). The kappa coefficient is a measure of consistency classification accuracy, which means it measures the agreement between the predicted and actual categories.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the training process continues until the model's performance on the test set, as measured by these criteria, is considered satisfactory. However, the specific threshold or condition that determines when the training is complete is not provided in the context.

Moreover, the authors use the cross-entropy cost function and the stochastic gradient descent algorithm to optimize the model's weights. The cross-entropy cost function measures the difference between the predicted and actual probabilities, and the stochastic gradient descent algorithm adjusts the weights to minimize this difference.

In summary, while the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete are not provided in the context, it can be inferred that the training process continues until the model's performance on the test set, as measured by average accuracy, overall accuracy, and kappa coefficient, is considered satisfactory. The training process involves optimizing the model's weights using the cross-entropy cost function and the stochastic gradient descent algorithm.
