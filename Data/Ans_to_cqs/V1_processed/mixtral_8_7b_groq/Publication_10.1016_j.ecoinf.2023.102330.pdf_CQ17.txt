The provided context does not give specific information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline for the CNN model used in the study. However, it is mentioned that the CNN model used in the study was previously developed and trained on covey call spectrogram data.

In general, when developing deep learning models such as CNNs, regularization methods are often used to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, and performs poorly on new, unseen data. Regularization methods help to reduce overfitting by adding a penalty to the loss function, which discourages the model from learning overly complex patterns in the training data.

Two common regularization methods used in deep learning are dropout and L2 regularization. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are "dropped out" or ignored during training, which helps to prevent over-reliance on any single neuron and encourages the model to learn more robust features. L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This encourages the model to have smaller weights, which can help to reduce overfitting by preventing the model from learning overly complex patterns in the training data.

Without specific information from the context, it is not possible to say for certain which regularization methods were used in the development of the CNN model used in the study. However, it is mentioned that the model was previously developed and trained on a separate dataset, which suggests that some form of regularization was likely used to prevent overfitting during training.
