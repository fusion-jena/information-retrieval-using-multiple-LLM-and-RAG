After the model training, there are several postprocessing steps involved, which include the calculation of various metrics, generating saliency maps, and creating a confusion matrix. However, based on the provided context, only the calculation of metrics is mentioned.

In the context, the cost of computation in terms of time for different models is discussed. The training times for the Swin Transformer classifier, CoAtNet algorithm, and the proposed 3DUNetGSFormer are compared. Although this information does not directly mention any specific postprocessing metrics, it can be inferred that the training time is one of the metrics used to evaluate the performance of these models.

In addition, the section on the GAN network mentions the generation of class-specific random features (Im) with the dimension of n × γ. This implies that the generated features are also a part of the model evaluation process. However, the context does not provide specific details about how these features are used in the evaluation process.

Therefore, based on the given context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include:

1. Computation of training time for each model.
2. Evaluation of generated features (Im) for the GAN network.

However, other common postprocessing steps such as generating saliency maps, calculating additional metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and creating confusion matrices are not explicitly mentioned in the context.

 The postprocessing steps involved after the model training, as mentioned in the provided context, include the computation of training time for each model and the evaluation of generated features for the GAN network.
