The context provided does not give specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. However, it does mention that the number of neurons in the hidden layers of the deep learning model was determined using a rule where H (the number of neurons in each hidden layer) is equal to 2 times N (the number of input features) plus 1. It also states that MATLAB programming software was used to craft and assess the models, but it does not specify if any particular optimization techniques or learning rates were used. The focus of the provided context is more on the methods used for determining the architecture of the deep learning model and less on the specific hyperparameters used during training.
