The provided context discusses the use of deep learning methods, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for identifying individual birds based on images. However, it does not explicitly mention other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV.

Based on the context, it can be inferred that the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is the image format. The researchers collected and labeled images of individual birds, normalized them, and used them to train the CNNs. The CNNs were then used to identify individual birds based on their images.

The context also mentions the use of pre-trained networks, which were likely trained on large-scale image datasets such as ImageNet. These pre-trained networks can extract useful features from images, such as color and texture, which can be useful for distinguishing multiple objects.

Therefore, while the provided context primarily focuses on the use of image data in the deep learning pipeline, it is possible that other data formats such as audio or video could also be used in similar pipelines for different applications. For example, audio data could be used for speech recognition or sound event detection, while video data could be used for object detection or tracking in videos.

In summary, based on the provided context, the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline for individual bird identification is the image format. However, other data formats such as audio or video could also be used in similar deep learning pipelines for different applications.
