The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It only discusses the use of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform for land use and land cover (LULC) classification, which offers various functionalities for spatial data analysis, processing, and interpretation. However, it does not give information about the hardware infrastructure of GEE.

Deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) typically require substantial computational power for training, often provided by Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) in cloud-based environments. Since the text does not specify the use of local hardware for deep learning model training, it can be inferred that the training might have been conducted on a cloud-based platform. Nonetheless, the specific hardware resources employed remain undisclosed in the given context.
