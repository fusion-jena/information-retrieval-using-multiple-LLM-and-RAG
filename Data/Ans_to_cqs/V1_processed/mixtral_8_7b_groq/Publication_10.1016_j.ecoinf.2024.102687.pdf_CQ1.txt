The provided context does not give specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for eco-acoustic studies. However, it does mention that automatic identification of biophonic sources in soundscape recordings relies on digital signal processing techniques and advanced recognition technologies from the deep learning era. It can be inferred that the raw data for these studies is collected using various types of audio recorders or sensors that capture soundscape recordings. These recordings likely come from a variety of sources, such as surveys, long-term monitoring stations, or other data collection efforts in the field. Additionally, public datasets may also be used as a source of raw data. However, the specific methods used for data collection are not described in the given context.
