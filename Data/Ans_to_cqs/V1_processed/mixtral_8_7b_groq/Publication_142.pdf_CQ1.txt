In the context of deep learning for ecological applications, there are several methods used for collecting raw data in the pipeline. These methods include surveys, sensors, and public datasets.

Firstly, surveys are a common method for collecting ecological data. Surveys can be conducted through various means such as questionnaires, interviews, or field observations. For instance, wildlife recording apps or camera traps are examples of active sampling methods where images are collected specifically for the purpose of recording wildlife.

Secondly, sensors are used to collect data automatically. Sensors can be deployed in the environment to measure different variables like temperature, humidity, or light levels. In addition, sensors can also be used to collect image data. For example, camera traps are sensors that capture images when triggered by motion or heat.

Thirdly, public datasets are an essential source of raw data for deep learning in ecology. Public datasets can include social media imagery, CCTV, and imagery collected along linear infrastructure. These datasets are often large and diverse, providing a wealth of information about biodiversity. For instance, Flickr and Instagram are social media platforms that contain a vast number of images that could be analyzed for ecological insights.

Moreover, the text highlights the potential of using AI naturalists to analyze these unexploited image data. AI naturalists are designed to locate potential images of biodiversity and classify what they see. This approach is an example of internet ecology or 'iEcology,' where digital data collected for a different purpose is analyzed to gain insights into the natural world.

In summary, surveys, sensors, and public datasets are the primary methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for ecological applications. These methods provide a rich source of data that can be used to train deep learning models to gain insights into the natural world.
