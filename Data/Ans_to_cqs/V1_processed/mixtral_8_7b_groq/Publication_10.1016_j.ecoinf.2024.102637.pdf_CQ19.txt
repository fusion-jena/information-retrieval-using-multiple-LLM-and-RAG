The provided context does not explicitly mention which deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, were used to build the SIAlex model. However, it is mentioned that the model utilizes AlexNet as its backbone, and that the number of layers in the model is reduced using structural re-parameterization. This implies that the developers likely used a flexible framework that allowed for customization of the model architecture and the implementation of structural re-parameterization.

Moreover, both TensorFlow and PyTorch support AlexNet and have built-in functions for layer manipulation and re-parameterization. Therefore, it is plausible that either TensorFlow or PyTorch was used to build the SIAlex model. Nonetheless, without further information, it is not possible to definitively determine which framework was used.
