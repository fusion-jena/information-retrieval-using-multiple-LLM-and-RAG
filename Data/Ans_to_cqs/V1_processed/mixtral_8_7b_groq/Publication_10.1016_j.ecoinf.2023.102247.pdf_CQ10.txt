The provided context does not include information about a deep learning pipeline or a link to a code repository on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. The study described in the context used the BIOMOD2 package in R to build ensemble models for predicting the distribution of study species. The models were based on regression and machine learning techniques, including MaxEnt, RF (Random Forest), and SVM (Support Vector Machines), but there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline.
