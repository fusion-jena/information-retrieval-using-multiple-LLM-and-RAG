Based on the provided context, there is no specific strategy mentioned for monitoring the model performance during training. The documents discuss various topics related to agriculture, soil water content, visualization tools, and data exchange but they do not provide information on model performance monitoring strategies during training.

However, it is generally important to monitor model performance during training to ensure that the model is learning effectively and not overfitting or underfitting the data. This can be done using various evaluation metrics such as loss function, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc. for supervised learning models. For unsupervised learning models, other metrics like silhouette score, elbow method, etc. can be used.

Moreover, techniques like cross-validation, early stopping, learning rate scheduling, etc. can be implemented to improve model performance and prevent overfitting or underfitting. Monitoring model performance during training helps in adjusting these techniques and choosing the best model for the specific task.

Therefore, although not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, monitoring model performance during training is a crucial step in machine learning and data science projects.
