The provided context includes information about various evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of machine learning models, although it does not explicitly mention a deep learning model. However, I will provide an answer based on the given context, assuming the deep learning model refers to the XGBoost model used in the studies.



The evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the XGBoost model include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and Kappa.

Accuracy (OA) is the ratio of correctly classified points to the total number of points examined. It gives an overall idea of how well the model is performing.

Precision is the ratio of true positives (TP) to the sum of true positives and false positives (FP). It measures the proportion of correct positive predictions out of all positive predictions made by the model.

Recall, also known as sensitivity, is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives (FN). It measures the proportion of correctly identified positive instances among all actual positive instances.

F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, given by the formula 2(Precision Ã— Recall) / (Precision + Recall). It provides a balanced assessment of both precision and recall.

Kappa is a statistical measure of the agreement between the predicted and actual classifications. It takes into account the possibility of the agreement occurring by chance. The Kappa value ranges from -1 to 1, where 1 indicates perfect agreement, and 0 indicates agreement no better than chance.

In the given context, Tables 7 and 8 present the precision, recall, F1 score, and Kappa values for the land use/land cover classification and forest types accuracy, respectively. These values can be used to evaluate the performance of the XGBoost model in classifying land use, land cover, and forest types.
