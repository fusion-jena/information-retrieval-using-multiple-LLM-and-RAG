The provided context discusses several datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for bird species recognition. However, it does not explicitly list all the datasets used. Here are the datasets mentioned:

1. CUB-200-2011 (Wah et al., 2011): This dataset consists of 11,788 images of 200 bird species, with an initial recognition accuracy of 85.70% and 82.10% for two different models. After data augmentation, the recognition accuracy increased to 87.60% and 89.50%.
2. Birdsnap (BirdGuides, 2012): Although not explicitly stated, this dataset is mentioned as one of the online sources for bird image data.
3. A dataset of 83 Indonesian bird species: This dataset is used for recognizing endemic birds in Indonesia. It initially had 8057 images, with a recognition accuracy of 88.07%.
4. A dataset of 3 bird species: This dataset initially contained 1000 images, with a recognition accuracy of 90.00%.
5. A dataset of 29 bird species: This dataset has 31,320 images, with a recognition accuracy of 98.39%.

Additionally, the context discusses various techniques for improving deep learning models, such as data augmentation, transfer learning, and hyperparameter optimization. These techniques are applied to the aforementioned datasets to improve recognition accuracy.

In summary, the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for bird species recognition include CUB-200-2011, Birdsnap, and three other datasets of Indonesian bird species, 3 bird species, and 29 bird species. These datasets are used in conjunction with techniques such as data augmentation, transfer learning, and hyperparameter optimization to improve recognition accuracy.
