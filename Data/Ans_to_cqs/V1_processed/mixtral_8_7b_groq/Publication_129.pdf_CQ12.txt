The deep learning model used in the pipeline described is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is specified in the context when it mentions using a "pre-trained CNN architecture" such as Inception, Residual Neural Network (Resnet), and Dense Convolutional Network (Densenet) for object detection.

A Convolutional Neural Network is a type of deep learning model that is particularly good for processing grid-like data, such as time-series data and images. CNNs have been widely used in various computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation.

In the described pipeline, the CNN is used as a feature extractor to generate feature maps from the input image. These feature maps are then fed into a Region Proposal Network (RPN) to propose object locations. Finally, a regressor and classifier are trained to adjust these proposed locations and predict the object classes with corresponding bounding box areas.

Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model used in the described pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
