The provided context does not give specific information about the learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning models for seagrass meadows detection. However, it does mention three different models used for this task: a deep learning-based CNN model, the DeepLabv3+ model, and a Cspnet-based model.

The deep learning-based CNN model used by Martin-Abadal et al. (2018) achieved a precision of 96.57% and an accuracy of 96.81% on their dataset. However, the specific hyperparameters used in this model are not provided.

Weidmann et al. (2019) found that the DeepLabv3+ model achieved the highest performance with a mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 87.78% compared to other models such as fully convolutional networks, dilated convolution networks, and U-Net on the ‘LookingForSeagrass’ dataset. Again, the specific hyperparameters used in this model are not provided.

The Cspnet model is a new backbone that can enhance the learning capability of CNNs. While the context does not provide specific information about the use of this model in seagrass meadows detection, it is mentioned as a potential approach for improving the accuracy of deep learning models.

In addition to the deep learning models, the context also provides information about fusion methods used for feature extraction. These fusion methods include unbounded fusion, softmax-based fusion, and fast normalized fusion. However, these fusion methods are not directly related to the hyperparameters of the deep learning models.

Therefore, while the context provides information about several deep learning models used for seagrass meadows detection, it does not give specific details about the hyperparameters used in these models.
