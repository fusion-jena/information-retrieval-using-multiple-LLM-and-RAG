Based on the provided context, there is no direct link to a data repository for a deep learning pipeline. However, the context does provide several links to data repositories and resources related to the research on ecological carbon sinks and their risk zones, which could potentially be used for developing a deep learning pipeline.

Here are some of the relevant data repositories and resources:

1. Resource Environment Science and Data Research Center (<http://www.resdc.cn/>) - This website provides a wide range of socio-economic and environmental data for China, including GDP, population, and food production data, which could be useful for developing a deep learning pipeline for predicting carbon sink stability.
2. OpenStreetMap (<https://www.openstreetmap.org/>) - This website provides a free, editable map of the world, which could be used for obtaining spatial data for developing a deep learning pipeline.
3. Geospatial Data Cloud (<http://www.gscloud.cn/>) - This website provides a platform for data sharing and services for geospatial data, which could be useful for obtaining remote sensing data for developing a deep learning pipeline.
4. National Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Scientific Data Center (<http://data.tpdc.ac.cn/>) - This website provides data resources related to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, which could be useful for obtaining environmental data for developing a deep learning pipeline.
5. National Earth System Science Data Center (<http://www.resdc.cn/data.aspx?DATAID=252>) - This website provides remote sensing data for China, including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data, which could be useful for developing a deep learning pipeline.
6. Chinese Research Data Services Platform (<http://www.cnrds.com/>) - This website provides a platform for data sharing and services for research data in China, which could be useful for obtaining research data for developing a deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, while there is no direct link to a data repository for a deep learning pipeline, the provided context does offer several resources for obtaining the necessary data for developing such a pipeline.
