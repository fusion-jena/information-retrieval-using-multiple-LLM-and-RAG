The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline described in the context are not explicitly named as standard datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, two datasets are created and used for training and validating the model.

Firstly, a training dataset is created by using 85% (111,244/130,858) of the original images, which have been size-reduced to 64x64 pixels from 256x256 pixels. This dataset is used to train the model with a large batch size of 128 for each iteration. The training dataset images are balanced for all species, ensuring that rare species with small image numbers will not be under-represented and under-classified relative to common species.

Secondly, a validation dataset is created by using 15% (19,614/130,858) of the original images. This dataset is used to test the model's performance and evaluate the taxon bias. The validation dataset images are filtered data, and the model's performance is tested under different conditions, such as human and natural conditions.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline uses two custom datasets, a training dataset with 85% of the size-reduced images and a validation dataset with 15% of the original images. These datasets are used to train, validate, and test the model's performance, taxon bias, and generalization.
