In the context provided, there is no explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training of the online chronic disease prediction system is complete. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to use various criteria to determine when to stop training, such as:

1. Validation Loss Plateau: Training can be stopped when the validation loss does not decrease for a certain number of epochs, indicating that the model is overfitting to the training data.

2. Early Stopping: A technique that stops training when the performance on a validation set stops improving, even if the training loss is still decreasing.

3. Learning Rate Decay: Gradually decreasing the learning rate as training progresses, allowing the model to converge to a better minimum.

4. Monitoring Other Metrics: In some cases, other metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score can be used to determine when training should be stopped.

In the context of the paper "An online chronic disease prediction system based on incremental deep neural network" by Yang, B.; Xiang, L.; Chen, X.; Jia, W., it can be inferred that they may have used one or more of these criteria to determine when training is complete. However, the specific criteria are not mentioned in the provided context.
