The provided context does not contain information about the use of deep learning algorithms, nor does it mention any of the standard datasets used in deep learning pipelines, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the context focuses on the application of machine learning algorithms in the fields of geographic information systems, microbial community functions, species distribution modeling, and microbiology.

In the context, the "sdm," "dismo," "bioclim," and "biomod2" packages are mentioned as being used for machine learning analysis. However, these packages are not directly related to deep learning and are more focused on species distribution modeling and ecological niche modeling.

The "shiny" package is mentioned as being used for extracting model mean performances for AUC, ROC, TSS, KAPPA, and COR values in RStudio. AUC (Area Under the Curve) is a metric used to evaluate the performance of classification models, and ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curves are used to visualize the performance of binary classifiers. However, these metrics are not specific to deep learning.

The Bio-ORACLE marine environmental data rasters dataset is mentioned in the context as a global environmental dataset for marine species distribution modeling. This dataset is used for species distribution modeling and not for deep learning.

In summary, the provided context does not contain information about the use of deep learning algorithms or the standard datasets used in deep learning pipelines. Instead, it focuses on the application of machine learning algorithms in various fields, such as geographic information systems, microbial community functions, species distribution modeling, and microbiology.
