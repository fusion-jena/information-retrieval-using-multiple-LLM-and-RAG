Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the SSA-TPRF model are optimized. The text does not mention any specific techniques such as grid search, random search, or others.

However, it does provide information about the experimental groups (EXP1-EXP10) that were used to study the effect of tile size on the accuracy of the model. Each experimental group used a different tile size, but the classification approach and the classification model remained the same. This suggests that the authors might have used a fixed set of hyperparameters for each experimental group and studied the impact of tile size on the model's accuracy.

Additionally, the authors compared the SSA-TPRF model with other PBA-based models and a traditional overall model. This comparison implies that the authors might have optimized the hyperparameters of these models using some techniques, but the text does not provide any details about it.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameter optimization techniques used for the SSA-TPRF model, it suggests that the authors might have used a fixed set of hyperparameters for each experimental group. However, the optimization techniques for other compared models remain unknown.
