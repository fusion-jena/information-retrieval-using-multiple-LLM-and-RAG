Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, there is some information on data pre-processing techniques used in specific studies.

In [23], the authors used RGB images of maize from UAV flights in different seasons in Brazil, resulting in a total of 630 images. The data pre-processing step involved creating the ground truth to train the CNN, which required the supervision of Janaina G. Arantes from the UFSCar Hydrobiology Department to identify the invasive species. This process was made using GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) for each image taken.

In [24], the authors used high-resolution UAV imagery for plant species and community segmentation. However, there is no mention of any technique used to address data bias during preprocessing.

In [25], the authors evaluated the accuracy of orthomosaics generated by different methods using a UAV platform. They mentioned that the quality of the training data is crucial for the success of machine learning algorithms. However, they did not explicitly mention any technique used to address data bias during preprocessing.

In [28], the authors proposed a semi-supervised deep convolutional network to learn image features with fewer labels. They mentioned that data imbalance is a common problem in many real-world applications, but they did not explicitly mention any technique used to address data bias during preprocessing.

Therefore, while there is some information on data pre-processing techniques used in specific studies, there is no explicit mention of techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing in the provided context. Techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection could be used to address data bias during preprocessing, but there is no evidence of their use in the provided context.
