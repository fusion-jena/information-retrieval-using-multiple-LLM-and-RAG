Unfortunately, there is no specific code repository link provided in the context regarding the deep learning pipeline for insect pest detection and classification. However, there are a few resources mentioned that might contain the information you are looking for.

The first set of papers by Rustia et al. (2021, 2021a, 2021b) describe an online semi-supervised learning approach and a multi-stage deep learning method for automated insect pest monitoring and recognition. Although there is no direct link to a code repository, the authors mention that their method was implemented using TensorFlow, a popular open-source machine learning platform.

Another paper by Wang et al. (2020a, 2020b, 2020c) uses YOLOv3, a real-time object detection system, to detect and classify pest species. The authors achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP) score of 63.54%. The YOLOv3 code is available on GitHub (<https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3>), but it is not clear if the exact implementation of Wang et al. is available.

Furthermore, there is a GitHub repository named "make-sense" by Skalski (2019), which contains code for object detection and image classification. However, it is not explicitly mentioned if this repository includes a deep learning pipeline for insect pest detection.

Lastly, the SmartProtect Platform (<https://platform.smartprotect-h2020.eu/en/search?applications%5B0%5D=4>) provides AI-based solutions for pest and disease management in agriculture. While there is no direct link to a code repository, it is possible that the platform contains the deep learning pipeline you are looking for.

In summary, while there is no direct code repository link provided in the context, there are a few resources mentioned that might contain the information you are looking for. You may want to explore the TensorFlow, YOLOv3, and "make-sense" GitHub repositories, as well as the SmartProtect Platform for possible deep learning pipelines for insect pest detection and classification.
