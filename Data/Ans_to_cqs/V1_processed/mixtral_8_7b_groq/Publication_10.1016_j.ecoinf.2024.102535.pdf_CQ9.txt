Based on the provided context, there is no clear information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The article "Convolutional neural networks for hydrothermal vents substratum classification: An introspective study" discusses the use of deep learning techniques for image classification of hydrothermal vents. However, it does not mention where the data repository is located.

The abstract mentions the use of optical imagery datasets for evaluating the performance of deep learning-based techniques in deep-water studies. However, it does not provide information on where the datasets used in the study can be accessed.

The article does cite several papers related to deep learning and image classification, such as "Xception: deep learning with depthwise separable convolutions" by Chollet (2017), "An image is worth 16x16 words: transformers for image recognition at scale" by Dosovitskiy et al. (2021), and "Automated classification of fauna in seabed photographs: the impact of training and validation dataset size, with considerations for the class imbalance" by Durden et al. (2021). However, these papers do not provide information on the data repository used in the study either.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query as it is not mentioned in the given context.
