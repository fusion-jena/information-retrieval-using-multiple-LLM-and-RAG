The text provided does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of Landsat 8 satellite imagery in the creation of fire risk maps.

Landsat 8 is a satellite operated by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) that captures images of the Earth's surface. These images can be used as raw data in a deep learning pipeline for various applications such as land cover classification, object detection, and change detection.

The text also mentions that the Landsat 8 images underwent atmospheric correction and were then classified into four susceptibility classes using Jenks' natural break classification method. This process of preprocessing and feature engineering is an important step in the deep learning pipeline, where raw data is transformed into a format that can be used for machine learning algorithms.

In summary, while the text does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it does provide information about the use of Landsat 8 satellite imagery as raw data and the preprocessing steps taken to prepare the data for analysis. Other possible sources of raw data for deep learning pipelines include surveys, public datasets, and sensor data.
