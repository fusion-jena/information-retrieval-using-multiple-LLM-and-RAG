The provided context discusses the use of ImageNet as a dataset in deep learning for image recognition tasks. ImageNet is a large-scale dataset that consists of more than 14 million high-resolution images across nearly 22,000 categories (Deng et al., 2009; Krizhevsky et al., 2017). It is often used as a starting point for recognition tasks with deep learning due to its extensive and diverse collection of images.

In the context of fish image processing for ecology and evolutionary biology, the authors mention the use of pre-trained CNNs (convolutional neural networks) but do not explicitly specify the dataset used for pre-training (Schwartz & Alfaro, 2021). However, given the widespread use of ImageNet as a pre-training dataset in the field of computer vision, it is reasonable to assume that pre-trained CNNs used for fish image processing may have been pre-trained on ImageNet.

The context does not mention any other specific datasets used in deep learning pipelines, such as MNIST or CIFAR. MNIST is a dataset of handwritten digits, while CIFAR is a dataset of natural images, and both are commonly used for image classification tasks in deep learning (LeCun et al., 1998; Krizhevsky et al., 2009).

In summary, the provided context specifically mentions the use of ImageNet as a dataset in deep learning for image recognition tasks. While other datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR are not explicitly mentioned, it is possible that they were used in other studies or applications not discussed in the provided context.
