The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline for satellite image classification is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This information can be inferred from the context provided, specifically from the title "Deep learning for satellite image classification" and the mention of "a series of feed forward layers" which is a characteristic of CNNs. Additionally, the paper "Deepsat v2: feature augmented convolutional neural nets for satellite image classification" by Liu et al. (2020) also indicates the use of a CNN for satellite image classification.

A CNN is a type of neural network that is particularly well-suited for handling image data. It is designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from images, which makes it an ideal choice for image classification tasks. The CNN consists of multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. These layers work together to extract and transform the image data, ultimately producing a classification result.

In the context of satellite image classification, a CNN can be trained on a large dataset of labeled satellite images to learn the features that distinguish different land cover classes. Once trained, the CNN can then be applied to new satellite images to classify them into the appropriate land cover categories.

It's worth noting that while the context provided does not explicitly mention the use of any other types of deep learning models (such as RNNs or Transformers), it is possible that other models could also be used for satellite image classification. However, based on the information provided, a CNN is the most likely choice.
