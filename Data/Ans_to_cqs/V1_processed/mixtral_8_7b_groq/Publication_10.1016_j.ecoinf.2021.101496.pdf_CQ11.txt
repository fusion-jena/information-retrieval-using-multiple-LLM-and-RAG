Based on the provided context, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link for such a pipeline. The closest related topic is the use of an artificial neural network (ANN) for modeling SPAD value in plants, as mentioned in the paper by Kanani and Padole (2020). However, there is no information provided about a data repository link for this specific ANN model or the dataset used for training and testing it.

Therefore, I cannot provide a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline as it is not mentioned or provided in the given context.
