Based on the provided context, the process of deploying the trained deep learning model for species richness estimation involved model serialization, but there is no explicit information about the platform selection.

First, the deep learning model was trained on a specific dataset related to Korea for model training and testing. TensorFlow, an end-to-end open-source platform for deep learning, was used to develop the model. After training the model, it was essential to save the trained model for further use, i.e., model serialization. Model serialization is the process of saving the trained model so that it can be deployed in a variety of environments. In TensorFlow, you can save the entire model (including the architecture, learned weights, and optimizer state) using the `save()` method.

However, the context does not provide information on the platform selection for deploying the model. Platform selection is an essential step in deploying a deep learning model, as it determines where the model will be hosted and how it will be served to the end-users. Common deep learning deployment platforms include local servers, cloud services (such as Google Cloud, AWS, or Azure), or edge devices (such as mobile phones or embedded systems). The choice of platform depends on factors such as the required inference speed, the volume of data to be processed, and the available resources.

In summary, based on the provided context, the deep learning model for species richness estimation was trained using TensorFlow and then serialized for further use. However, there is no information about the platform selection for deploying the model.
