Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning that were performed on the input data before training the DeepLabV3+ model. However, it is mentioned that the model was trained using a combination of RGB and NIR bands, requiring a GPU with significant power and adjustments to the DeepLabV3+ architecture.

Additionally, when training a land cover model using the Vasiliko and Kimisala dataset, the authors used the weights of a pre-trained model based on the Xception-65 backbone as the starting point, fine-tuning them further for their specific use case. This suggests that the input data might have been preprocessed in a way that was compatible with the pre-trained model, but the context does not provide enough information to make a definitive conclusion.

In general, preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, and cleaning are crucial for the success of deep learning models. Normalization ensures that all features have a similar scale, which can help the model converge faster during training. Scaling can be applied to adjust the range of input features, and cleaning can help remove noise or outliers from the data. However, the specific preprocessing steps for a given deep learning model depend on the nature of the input data and the model architecture.
