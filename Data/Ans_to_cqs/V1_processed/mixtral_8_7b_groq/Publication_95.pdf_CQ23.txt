The text provided gives information about the steps taken to ensure the validity and generalizability of the deep learning model, but it does not explicitly mention the use of cross-validation or stratified splitting. However, it does describe the use of a diverse dataset and the splitting of the data into a training set, validation set, and test set.

To ensure the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data, the authors split the dataset into three subsets: a training set, a validation set, and a test set. The training set was used to optimize the model's parameters, while the validation set was used to monitor the model's performance during training and to compare the performance of different networks. The test set was used as a final evaluation of the network. To ensure a proper evaluation on both the validation set and the test set, the samples in each set were required to be independent and have similar class distributions.

Additionally, the authors took steps to ensure the diversity of the dataset. Instead of using a na√Øve approach to randomly sample images from the full dataset, they considered the potential overlap of images captured in close proximity. To address this, they suggested an alternative approach of splitting the collected data based on the time or location of image capture.

In summary, the authors ensured the generalizability of the deep learning model by using a diverse dataset, splitting it into a training set, validation set, and test set, and carefully considering the way they split the data to avoid potential overlap and maintain similar class distributions. However, they did not explicitly mention the use of cross-validation or stratified splitting.
