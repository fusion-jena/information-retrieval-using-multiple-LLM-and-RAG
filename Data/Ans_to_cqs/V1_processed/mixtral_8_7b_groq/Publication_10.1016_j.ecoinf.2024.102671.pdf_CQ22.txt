The provided context does not include specific information about the evaluation metrics used for the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that cross-validation techniques are recommended for assessing the predictive accuracy and robustness of the zoning methods.

In general, for evaluating the performance of deep learning models, several metrics can be used, such as:

1. Accuracy: It is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of input samples. It is a common metric used to evaluate the performance of classification models.
2. Precision: It is the ratio of the number of true positive predictions to the total number of positive predictions. It measures the exactness of the model.
3. Recall: It is the ratio of the number of true positive predictions to the total number of actual positive samples. It measures the completeness of the model.
4. F1-score: It is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It provides a balanced measure of both precision and recall.
5. Mean Absolute Error (MAE): It is the average of the absolute differences between the predicted and actual values. It is commonly used for regression problems.
6. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): It is the square root of the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values. It is also commonly used for regression problems.
7. Area Under the Curve (AUC): It is a metric used for binary classification problems. It measures the entire two-dimensional area underneath the entire ROC curve (receiver operating characteristic curve) from (0,0) to (1,1).

Therefore, depending on the specific problem and the nature of the data, one or more of these metrics can be used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model.
