I don't know the answer to this query because the provided context does not contain any information about deep learning models, their hyperparameters, or the use of such models in the studies mentioned.

The context consists of research papers and figures related to forest biomass, carbon storage, and community classification. While these studies might use machine learning techniques for data analysis, they do not specify the use of deep learning models or their hyperparameters.

Deep learning models typically have hyperparameters such as learning rate, optimizer, batch size, number of layers, and number of neurons per layer. These hyperparameters are usually determined through a process called hyperparameter tuning, where different combinations of hyperparameters are tried to find the best model performance. However, the provided context does not contain enough information to determine the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model for forest biomass estimation or analysis.
