Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The text describes the methodology, implementation details, and experimental results of a study related to forested area classification using remote sensing data. However, it does not mention where the code for this pipeline is located. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query. It is possible that the code is not publicly available, or it may be hosted on a platform other than GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. If you are interested in accessing the code, I would recommend reaching out to the authors or affiliated organizations for more information.
