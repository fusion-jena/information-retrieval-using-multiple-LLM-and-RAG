Based on the provided context, the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the SDP-EPL model is not explicitly stated as a validation loss plateau. Instead, the training of the SDP-EPL model is completed when it has been run for up to 400 epochs, and the AUC (Area Under the Curve) of the model on the validation set has been evaluated.

The AUC is a performance metric used to assess the ability of a binary classification model, such as the SDP-EPL model, to distinguish between positive and negative classes. In this case, the positive class refers to the presence of presence locations (PL), and the negative class refers to the absence of presence locations (PL).

To determine the optimal value of K (the number of pseudo-absence samples generated for each pseudo-presence sample) for the SDP-EPL model, the AUC was evaluated for different values of K. Specifically, K was varied from 50 to 400, and the AUC was calculated for each value of K. It was found that the AUC was higher for values of K greater than 50, but at K = 800, the AUC decreased significantly. When K = 200, the AUC gradually improved as the number of training epochs increased, achieving the highest score overall.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the training of the SDP-EPL model is completed when it has been run for up to 400 epochs, and the AUC has been evaluated for K = 200, which was found to be the optimal value of K. However, the context does not provide information on whether the training was stopped early if the AUC plateaued before 400 epochs.
