The provided context does not explicitly mention which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the image data and ancillary data are stored in YAML or JSON files, which are commonly used for data storage and manipulation in deep learning projects. Additionally, the context mentions various image and sampling parameters, such as pixel resolution, field of view, and geographic and temporal coverage, which are typically used as inputs for training deep learning models. Therefore, while the specific frameworks are not specified, it can be inferred that a deep learning framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch is likely being used in conjunction with these data and parameters.
