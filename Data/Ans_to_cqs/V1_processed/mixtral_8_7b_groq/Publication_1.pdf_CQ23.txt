The text provided does not give specific details about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model is progressively trained to detect and classify events of interest using machine learning techniques, which implies that some methods for improving generalizability were likely employed.

In general, there are several strategies that can be used to enhance the ability of a deep learning model to generalize to new data. These include:

1. Diverse dataset: Using a dataset that is representative of the range of variability in the data can help ensure that the model is able to handle new, unseen data.
2. Cross-validation: This technique involves dividing the dataset into training and validation sets, and training the model on the training set while evaluating its performance on the validation set. This can help prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize.
3. Stratified splitting: This is a method of dividing the dataset into training and validation sets that ensures that the distribution of classes in the training set is similar to the distribution in the overall dataset. This can help ensure that the model is trained on a representative sample of the data and is able to handle the full range of classes it may encounter.

Without more information about the specific methods used in the study described, it is not possible to say for certain which of these strategies were employed. However, it is likely that some combination of these techniques was used to improve the generalizability of the deep learning model.
