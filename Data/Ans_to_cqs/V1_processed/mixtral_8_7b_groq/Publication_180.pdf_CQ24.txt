The provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of TensorFlow, an open-source software platform for deep learning research and applications. TensorFlow allows for the configuration of various parameters, including the validation percentage and number of training steps.

In the context of handling randomness, one strategy that could be employed is the use of a fixed random seed value. This ensures that the same random sequence is used in different runs of the model, which can be useful for reproducibility and comparison of results. Additionally, techniques such as dropout and data augmentation can help to introduce randomness and reduce overfitting in deep learning models. Dropout randomly sets a fraction of input units to 0 during training, which helps to prevent co-adaptation of feature detectors. Data augmentation involves generating new training examples by applying random transformations to the existing data, such as rotation, scaling, and flipping. This can help to increase the size and diversity of the training set, and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

It's worth noting that while the context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness, it does highlight the importance of adjusting parameters and exploring different settings to find the optimum balance between computing time and classification efficiency. This suggests a general approach of careful configuration and experimentation to optimize deep learning models, which could include strategies for handling randomness as well.
