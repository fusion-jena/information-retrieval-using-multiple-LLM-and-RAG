The provided context does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete in the study. However, it does mention that the data were split into 10 equal parts for k-fold cross-validation and that each model was trained on 90% of the data and validated on the remaining 10%. This process was performed for each tenth of the data. Additionally, leave-one-out cross-validation was used to determine how well the models might perform on data collected on birds from different colonies. However, the criteria for determining when training is complete are not specified. It is possible that the criteria are not mentioned in the provided context or that a different method was used to determine when training was complete.
