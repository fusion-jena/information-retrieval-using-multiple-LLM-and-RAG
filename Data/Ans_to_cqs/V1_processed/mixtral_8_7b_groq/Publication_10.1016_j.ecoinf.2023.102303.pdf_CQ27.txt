The context does not provide detailed information on the specific steps taken to deploy the trained deep learning models. However, it does mention that two novel deep learning networks were developed using the FishInTurbidWater dataset. The first model uses semi-supervised contrastive learning for significantly accelerated model deployment time, while the second model is weakly-supervised, aiming to shorten deployment time while maintaining high accuracy.

Additionally, the context discusses the training time for different labeling scenarios (very short, short, and very long labeling times) and the turnaround time for each. The turnaround time refers to the time from data collection to model deployment. The context also mentions that an ensemble of the two independent models was used, which implies that the models were combined in some way to make a final prediction.

Considering common deep learning deployment practices, it can be inferred that the models were likely serialized, meaning they were saved in a format that could be easily loaded and used for making predictions on new data. The choice of platform for deployment would depend on the specific use case and requirements. Common platforms for deep learning model deployment include local servers, cloud-based solutions, or edge devices, depending on the computational resources needed and the desired latency for predictions.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit details on the model deployment process, it can be inferred that the models were likely serialized, and the choice of platform would depend on the specific use case. The focus of the work was on developing and training accurate deep learning models with short turnaround times using semi-supervised and weakly-supervised approaches.
