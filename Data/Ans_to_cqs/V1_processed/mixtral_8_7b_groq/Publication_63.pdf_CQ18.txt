The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of a validation dataset and the computation of the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) after each epoch. Specifically, the dataset was split into a training dataset, used to train the weights of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, and a validation dataset, which indicated the training progress after each full training cycle (epoch). The MAE of the validation dataset was computed after each epoch, and models were trained until the validation MAE did not further improve compared to the preceding epochs and diverged from the training MAE (a condition known as 'overfit'). This process allowed for the real-time monitoring of the model's performance and prevented overfitting. Additionally, a test dataset, extracted as a random sample of 10% of the dataset of each trait before model training, was used for the independent evaluation of the trained models. This dataset was not involved in the training process.
