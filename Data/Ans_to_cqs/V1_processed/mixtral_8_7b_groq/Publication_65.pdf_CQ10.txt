The provided context does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text focuses on the comparison of different deep learning architectures for tree detection in urban areas, specifically in the Cerrado biome. The authors evaluate the performance of FCN, U-Net, SegNet, DeepLabV3+, and DDCN based on the number of parameters, training and inference time, and visual analysis of feature maps. However, there is no mention of the code repository or the programming language used in the study. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to the code repository.
