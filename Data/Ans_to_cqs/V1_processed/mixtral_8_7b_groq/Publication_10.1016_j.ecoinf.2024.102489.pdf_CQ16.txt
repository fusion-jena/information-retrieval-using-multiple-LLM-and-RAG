Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the criteria used to determine when the training of the random forest (RF) model is complete. However, it does mention that the RF model's parameters, such as the number of trees (n\_estimators), minimum number of leaves (minleaf), and number of randomly selected node-split feature variables (max\_features), were optimized using a grid search method (GridSearchCV) based on the out-of-bag (OOB) error and five-fold cross-validation. This process would have helped to assess the model's performance and possibly identify when the model has been adequately trained.

Additionally, the text mentions that high-quality LAI training samples were selected, and outliers were eliminated. This step would have contributed to the quality of the training data, which is crucial for the model's learning process.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly provide information on the criteria used to determine when the training of the RF model is complete, it does mention the use of techniques such as cross-validation, OOB error estimation, and careful selection of training data, which would have helped assess the model's performance and identify an appropriate point for stopping the training process.
