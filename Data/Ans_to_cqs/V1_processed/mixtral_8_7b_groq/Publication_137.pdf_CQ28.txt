The provided context does not explicitly mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the experiments were conducted using Ubuntu 16.0 as the experimental platform and PyTorch as the deep learning framework. Therefore, it can be inferred that the model was likely developed and trained on a local machine running Ubuntu 16.0 and PyTorch, rather than a cloud-based platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform.
