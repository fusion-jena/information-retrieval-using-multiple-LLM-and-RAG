Regularization methods are techniques used to prevent overfitting in statistical models, including deep learning algorithms. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise, and performs poorly on unseen data. Regularization introduces a penalty on the model's complexity to find a balance between fitting the data and maintaining the model's generalizability.

In the context of the provided information, the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned. However, the 'caretEnsemble' and 'neuralnet' packages used in the studies focus on model ensembling and neural network training, respectively. While these packages do not directly address regularization techniques, they can be combined with other methods to prevent overfitting.

One common regularization method for deep learning is L2 regularization (also known as weight decay or Ridge regression). L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, which is proportional to the sum of the squares of the model's weights. This penalty term discourages large weight values, promoting smaller, more conservative models.

Another popular regularization technique for deep learning is dropout. Dropout is a method that randomly sets a fraction of the hidden units to zero during training. This process prevents over-reliance on individual neurons, encouraging the network to learn more robust features. Dropout has been shown to improve the performance of deep learning models and reduce overfitting.

The 'neuralnet' package does not explicitly support L2 regularization or dropout. However, these techniques can be implemented during the construction of the neural network model. For L2 regularization, a penalty term can be added to the loss function, while dropout can be achieved by randomly setting a fraction of the hidden units to zero during training.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, L2 regularization and dropout are two common techniques that can be applied. The 'neuralnet' package can be used for training neural networks, and regularization techniques can be incorporated during the model construction process.
