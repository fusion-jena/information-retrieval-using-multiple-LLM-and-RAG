The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the context provided, which mentions the use of convolution in feature extraction. Specifically, it refers to the original YOLOv8 network using the C2f module for feature extraction, which employs a convolution operation followed by a split operation on features. Additionally, the context also mentions the use of dilated convolution and depthwise separable convolution to reduce computations, further confirming the use of CNNs. The comparison of different models in the context also includes several variants of CNNs, such as ResNet50, ResNet18, and EfficientRep, but does not include Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a CNN.
