The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of two methods: jackknife and permutation importance. These methods help to estimate the relative contributions of the environmental and territorial variables to the MaxEnt model.

The jackknife method calculates the percentage contribution of each variable by adding the increase in regularized gain to the contribution of the corresponding variable in each iteration of the training algorithm. This allows for an assessment of the importance of each variable in the model's predictions.

Permutation importance, on the other hand, measures the values of a variable on training presence, and background data are randomly permuted. The model is then reevaluated on the permuted data, and the resulting drop in training AUC is shown, normalized to percentages. This method helps to understand how much each variable contributes to the model's ability to distinguish between presence and absence data.

In the context of the table provided, the variables being analyzed include temperature factors such as bio4 (temperature of wettest season) and bio9 (mean temperature of driest quarter), precipitation factors such as bio13 (precipitation of wettest month) and bio19 (precipitation of coldest quarter), and geographical factors such as slope. The percent contribution and permutation importance of each variable are calculated for two species, Quercus pubescens Willd. and Quercus ilex subsp. ilex.

By using these two methods, the model performance can be monitored during training, allowing for an assessment of the importance of each variable in the model's predictions and an understanding of how each variable contributes to the model's ability to distinguish between presence and absence data. This information can then be used to refine the model and improve its accuracy.
