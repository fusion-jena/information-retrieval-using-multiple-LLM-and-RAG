Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete in a machine learning or genomic annotation context. However, it does provide some insights into best practices for data management and use of controlled vocabularies that could indirectly relate to training data for machine learning models.

In the context of the CM database design for fish sampling data, the authors prioritized samples that contained necessary critical information for digital storage, such as fish sampling location, date, species, and life stage. This suggests that completeness and accuracy of data are important factors in determining the usability of data for digital storage and analysis. In the context of genomic annotation, Mao et al. (2005) used the KEGG Orthology (KO) as a controlled vocabulary to enable consistent and accurate information labeling. This also suggests that the use of controlled vocabularies and standardized labels can improve the quality of data and enable more accurate analysis.

In terms of determining when training is complete for machine learning models, best practices often include monitoring validation loss and accuracy over time and stopping training when validation loss plateaus or accuracy reaches a satisfactory level. This helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the model generalizes well to new data. However, the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete can depend on the specific problem, dataset, and model being used. Therefore, it is important to carefully evaluate the performance of the model and adjust training criteria as needed.


While the provided context does not directly answer the query about criteria used to determine when training is complete for machine learning models, it does emphasize the importance of data completeness, accuracy, and standardization in enabling effective digital storage and analysis. In terms of training criteria for machine learning models, best practices often include monitoring validation loss and accuracy over time and stopping training when validation loss plateaus or accuracy reaches a satisfactory level. However, the specific criteria used can depend on the specific problem, dataset, and model being used.
