In the deep learning pipeline, overfitting can be prevented using various regularization methods. While the context provided does not explicitly mention the use of dropout or L2 regularization in their model, it does discuss transfer learning which can act as a form of implicit regularization. I will briefly explain these techniques and their role in preventing overfitting.

1. Dropout: Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly sets a fraction of neurons in a layer to zero during training, preventing over-reliance on individual neurons and promoting the learning of more robust features. This helps reduce overfitting by making the model more invariant to the specific weights of neurons.

2. L2 Regularization: L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function, proportional to the square of the model's weights. This encourages smaller weights, reducing the complexity of the model and helping to prevent overfitting.

3. Transfer Learning: Although not explicitly stated as a regularization method, transfer learning can act as an implicit form of regularization. By initializing the model with pre-trained weights from large-scale datasets, the model starts with a better parameter initialization, reducing the risk of overfitting. This is because pre-trained weights often contain valuable information about general features, which can be fine-tuned for the specific task at hand.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline can utilize various regularization methods to prevent overfitting, including dropout, L2 regularization, and transfer learning. While the provided context does not explicitly mention dropout or L2 regularization, it does discuss transfer learning, which can act as an implicit regularization technique.
