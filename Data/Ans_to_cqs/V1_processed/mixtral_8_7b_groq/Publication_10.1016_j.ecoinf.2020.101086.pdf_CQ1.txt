The provided context does not discuss the deep learning pipeline or the specific methods used for collecting raw data in that pipeline. However, it does provide information about the use of presence data in species distribution models (SDMs) and the correction of sampling bias in such models.

In the context of SDMs, presence data refers to the locations where a particular species has been observed or recorded. These data can be collected through various methods such as field surveys, remote sensing techniques, and citizen science initiatives. However, the provided context does not go into the specifics of these data collection methods.

The main focus of the provided context is on addressing the issues of sampling bias and data scarcity in SDMs. Sampling bias occurs when the data collection process is not representative of the true distribution of the species, leading to inaccurate model predictions. Data scarcity, on the other hand, refers to the limited availability of presence data, which can also negatively impact the performance of SDMs.

To tackle these challenges, the authors propose a new method that considers both sampling bias and data scarcity in the context of SDMs. The method involves computing a relative sampling effort for each pixel in the study area, which corresponds to the sampling bias within the environmental space. This map is then used to bias the random selection of background points, increasing the likelihood of selecting background sites in areas with higher sampling effort.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly answer the query about data collection methods in deep learning pipelines, it does discuss the use of presence data in SDMs and the importance of addressing sampling bias and data scarcity in these models. The authors propose a new method to address these issues, but the context does not provide information on the specific data collection methods used for obtaining presence data.
