The data and codes for the research on "Building species distribution models using extensive data and deep learning pipelines" by R. Noda et al. are available in a GitHub repository at <https://github.com/RyokoNod/sdm-asian-elephants>. However, the provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline, such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. It is possible that the deep learning pipeline was not shared in a separate repository or that it was not specified in the given text. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
