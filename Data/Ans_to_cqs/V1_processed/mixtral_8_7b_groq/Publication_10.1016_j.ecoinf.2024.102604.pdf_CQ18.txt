Based on the provided context, there is no explicit description of a strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention two indicators used to evaluate the effectiveness of each model in correcting sampling bias: the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the distance measure (D). These indicators are likely used to evaluate the model performance after training is complete.

The context does provide information about two methods used to correct sampling bias in environmental spaces: geographic filtering and a representativeness-oriented method. The representativeness-oriented method assigns weights to presence points during model training based on the assessed representativeness of the underlying sampling effort. This approach could be seen as a way to monitor and adjust for bias during training, as it emphasizes presence samples in areas where sampling effort is relatively insufficient.

However, this method is not explicitly described as a strategy to monitor model performance during training. It is primarily discussed as a method to correct sampling bias and improve model performance after training is complete.

In summary, while the context provides information about methods used to correct sampling bias and evaluate model performance after training, there is no explicit description of a strategy implemented to monitor model performance during training.
