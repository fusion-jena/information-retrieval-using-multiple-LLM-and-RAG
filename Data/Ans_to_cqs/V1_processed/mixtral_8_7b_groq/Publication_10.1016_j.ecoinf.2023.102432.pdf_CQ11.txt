The provided context does not contain information about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link related to it, such as a Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF link. The context consists of various papers about different topics, including relation extraction from the web, invasive species monitoring, and multiple-instance learning algorithms. However, none of these papers mention a deep learning pipeline or provide a data repository link. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to this query.
