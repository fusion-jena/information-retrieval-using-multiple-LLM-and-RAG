The provided context does not give specific information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, it does mention some techniques and methods used in the overall process of building the model.

The model mentioned in the context is a convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for extracting deep features from bird songs. The CNN consists of four convolution kernel pooling layers, a fully connected layer, a dropout layer, and a Dense\_1 layer. The hyperparameters related to the architecture of the CNN, such as the number of convolution kernel pooling layers, the number of neurons in the fully connected layer, and the dropout rate, are not explicitly mentioned as being optimized using techniques like grid search or random search.

The context does mention the use of minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance (mRMR) for feature selection. This method is used to select the most efficient feature subsets from the raw feature set, which reduces the complexity and processing time of the classification algorithm. However, this method is not directly related to the optimization of hyperparameters.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.
