Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. The text mainly discusses the data platform's architecture, data sources, and loading processes. However, it does mention some relevant concepts such as diverse data collection and the use of a concept of Task in CASE's database, which may indirectly relate to addressing data bias.

Data bias can arise from various sources, such as unrepresentative samples, measurement errors, or missing data. Addressing data bias is crucial for building fair and accurate machine learning models. Some common techniques to tackle data bias include:

1. Stratified splitting: This method involves dividing the data into subgroups based on specific features (strata) and then randomly sampling from each subgroup. This ensures that each subgroup is proportionally represented in both the training and testing datasets.
2. Oversampling: In cases where certain classes or subgroups are underrepresented, oversampling can be used to increase their presence in the dataset. This can be done by replicating instances from the underrepresented class or using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to generate synthetic instances.
3. Undersampling: Conversely, if some classes or subgroups are overrepresented, undersampling can be used to reduce their presence in the dataset. This can be done by randomly removing instances from the overrepresented class.
4. Diverse data collection: Collecting data from various sources, locations, or demographic groups can help ensure that the dataset is representative and less biased.

Based on the context, it can be inferred that the data platform has a focus on data integration, enrichment, and efficient user experience. The system collects data from multiple sources, including a monitoring network, satellite images, weather, and environment data. This diverse data collection could potentially help reduce data bias. However, specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing are not mentioned.
