The text provided does not give a specific strategy that was implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention that the deep noise reduction techniques used for bioacoustic data are manually tuned to maximize the evaluation metrics. This suggests that the performance of the model was likely evaluated manually at various points during the training process, and adjustments were made to the model's parameters in order to improve its performance.

Additionally, the text mentions that ablation studies were conducted, which typically involve removing or altering certain components of a model and evaluating the impact on performance. This could provide another way to monitor the model's performance during training, by comparing the performance of the model with and without certain features or components.

Furthermore, the text states that data requirements are a key consideration for many monitoring applications, and that audio enhancement models require training data for fine-tuning. This implies that the performance of the model was likely monitored by evaluating its performance on a held-out set of training data, in order to ensure that the model was not overfitting to the training data.

In summary, while the text does not provide a specific strategy for monitoring the model performance during training, it suggests that the performance of the model was likely monitored manually, through ablation studies, and by evaluating the model's performance on a held-out set of training data.
