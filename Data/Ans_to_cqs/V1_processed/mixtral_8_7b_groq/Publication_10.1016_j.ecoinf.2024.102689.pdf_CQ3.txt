In the context of the research, the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline include both bounding box annotation and instance segmentation. For standalone object detection, annotation typically focuses on the recognition and marking of bounding boxes. However, in this research, the detection module has been integrated with instance segmentation. This necessitated the inclusion of mask annotations that precisely align with the segmented contours during the dataset preparation. To maintain uniformity and coherence, both the bounding boxes and masks are classified within the Roboflow integrated visualization.

Instance segmentation is a more advanced and complex annotation technique compared to bounding box annotation. It involves not only detecting and recognizing objects but also creating precise masks that outline each instance of an object in an image. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the exact shape and size of the object are important, such as in the high-resolution monitoring of fish length and catch numbers from landings using deep learning.

The use of instance segmentation in this research allows for more accurate and precise detection of objects, which is crucial for the quantification of the abundance, species richness, and size of reef fish assemblages using imaging sonar. Additionally, the integration of the detection module with instance segmentation enables the development of a more robust and accurate deep learning model for fish individual object segmentation.

In summary, the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline in this research include both bounding box annotation and instance segmentation. The latter is used to create precise masks that outline each instance of an object in an image, allowing for more accurate and precise detection of objects. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the exact shape and size of the object are important, such as in the high-resolution monitoring of fish length and catch numbers from landings using deep learning.
