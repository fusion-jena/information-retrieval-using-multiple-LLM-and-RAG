The provided context discusses a specific deep learning model used for plant species classification, but it does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, there are a few implicit strategies that can be inferred.

Firstly, the use of a pre-trained model suggests a form of regularization, which can help reduce the impact of randomness. Pre-trained models provide a robust starting point, reducing the reliance on random initialization.

Secondly, the use of a random search over fourth- and fifth-layer models of the leaf features positions implies the introduction of randomness in the model architecture. This strategy can help explore a wider range of model configurations, increasing the likelihood of finding a good solution.

Thirdly, the learning rate is set initially to 0.001 and then dropped by a learning ratio of 10 after every 60 epochs. This strategy can be seen as a form of learning rate scheduling, which can help stabilize training and reduce the impact of randomness.

Lastly, the context does not mention the use of a random seed value, but it's a common practice in deep learning to set a fixed seed value to ensure reproducibility of results. This strategy can help control randomness in the model's initialization, data shuffling, and other stochastic processes.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness, it implies the use of pre-training, random search, learning rate scheduling, and potentially, a fixed seed value. These strategies can help manage randomness in the deep learning pipeline, contributing to the model's robustness and performance.
