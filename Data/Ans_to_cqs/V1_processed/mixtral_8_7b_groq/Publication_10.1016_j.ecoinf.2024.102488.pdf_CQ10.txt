Based on the provided context, there is no direct link to a code repository for a deep learning pipeline. However, some of the papers mentioned use machine learning algorithms such as LightGBM and XGBoost for classifying vegetation communities and mapping multi-layered mangroves using remote sensing data.

For instance, Ke et al. (2017) introduced LightGBM, a highly efficient gradient boosting decision tree, and Liu et al. (2019) found that XGBoost and LightGBM perform well in identifying vegetation communities in karst wetlands. Li et al. (2021) mapped multi-layered mangroves using multispectral, hyperspectral, and LiDAR data, but they did not explicitly mention using deep learning techniques.

Therefore, if you are interested in deep learning pipelines for remote sensing data, you may want to look into other resources or repositories. Some popular deep learning libraries for remote sensing applications include TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch. You can find many code repositories and examples of deep learning pipelines for remote sensing on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket.

An example of a deep learning pipeline for remote sensing using TensorFlow can be found at the following link:

<https://github.com/tensorflow/tf-models/tree/master/research/deeplab>

This repository contains a deep learning model for semantic segmentation, which can be useful for classifying different land cover types in remote sensing images.

In summary, while the provided context does not contain a direct link to a code repository for a deep learning pipeline, there are many resources available online for deep learning applications in remote sensing.
