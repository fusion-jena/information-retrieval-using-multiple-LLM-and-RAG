Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline in this specific case seems to use remote sensing image data as its primary input format. There is no explicit mention of other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV.

The CSVM (Convolutional SVM) approach, which is the focus of the study, uses images of the Cerrado biome for deforestation detection. The images are processed through a series of convolutional layers, each followed by a max-pooling layer, to extract relevant features. These features are then used by Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to classify whether a given patch of the image represents deforestation or not.

The images are divided into smaller patches or "mini-patches" for learning the SVMs. The size of these mini-patches is 3 × 3 × 16 for the first convolutional layer and 3 × 3 × 12 for the second and third layers. This suggests that the images are processed in three dimensions, likely representing height, width, and color channels.

Therefore, the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is remote sensing images.
