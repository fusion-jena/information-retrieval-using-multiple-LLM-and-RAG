The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model for Pl@ntNet. The text only mentions that the training of the Pl@ntNet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) requires a high-performance computing infrastructure and expertise in deep, distributed, and large-scale learning. However, it does not specify if this infrastructure is located on-premise or on a cloud platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
