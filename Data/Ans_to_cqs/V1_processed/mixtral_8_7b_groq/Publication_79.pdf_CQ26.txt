The provided context does not give specific details about the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some data preprocessing and augmentation techniques that were used in a specific study.

In the study, all samples containing no-data values were excluded from the dataset. Six data augmentation techniques were then applied for the remaining training and validation samples. These techniques included rotation, width and height shift, shear transform, zoom, horizontal flip, and vertical flip. These techniques can help increase the diversity of the training data and reduce overfitting.

The complete sample set was randomly split into 70% for training and 30% for validation. A sliding window approach was employed to create the results.

In addition, the semantic segmentation was repeated for the first level (forest, grassland, and savanna) and then for each resulting savanna and grassland maps. The final Cerrado physiognomies map (and the respective accuracy metrics) is composed of the forest map (gallery forest), the savanna map (shrub savanna, typical savanna, woodlands savanna, Rupestrian savanna, and Vereda), and the grassland map (open grassland, shrub grassland, Rupestrian grassland, and humid open grassland). These methodological steps are represented in Figs.1(b).

While these techniques do not specifically address data bias, they do help improve the quality and diversity of the training data, which can indirectly help reduce data bias.

To directly address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling can be used. Stratified splitting involves dividing the data into subgroups based on certain characteristics, and then randomly splitting the data while preserving the balance of these subgroups. Oversampling involves increasing the number of samples from underrepresented groups, while undersampling involves decreasing the number of samples from overrepresented groups. Diverse data collection involves actively seeking out and collecting data from a wide range of sources and groups to ensure that the training data is representative of the target population.
