The context provided does not give specific details about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into subsets such as train, test, and validation. However, it does mention that the model was validated and calibrated on a validation set before being trained on the entire dataset. It also mentions that the best epoch was determined based on the performance on the validation set, and that conditional probabilities were normalized based on the observation dataset. Therefore, it can be inferred that some sort of data splitting strategy was used, but the specifics of this strategy are not provided.
