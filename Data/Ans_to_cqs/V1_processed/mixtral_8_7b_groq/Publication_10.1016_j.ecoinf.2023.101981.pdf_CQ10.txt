Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the code repository link of a specific deep learning pipeline used for a particular study. The sources mention various studies and techniques related to ecological monitoring, statistical computing, and deep learning for detecting and tracking animals, but they do not include a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket link for the deep learning pipeline.

Here are some related resources mentioned in the context:

1. R Development Core Team (2019) - R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing. This is a statistical computing environment, but it does not provide a deep learning pipeline.
2. Stowell et al. (2019) - Automatic acoustic detection of birds through deep learning: the first bird audio detection challenge. This study organized a challenge for automatic bird audio detection, but the paper does not provide a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline.
3. Sugai et al. (2019) - Terrestrial passive acoustic monitoring: review and perspectives. This paper is a review of terrestrial passive acoustic monitoring, including deep learning techniques, but it does not provide a code repository link for a deep learning pipeline.

If you are looking for a deep learning pipeline specifically designed for ecological monitoring or animal detection, I would recommend searching through open-source platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket for projects related to your interest. You can use keywords such as "deep learning," "animal detection," "acoustic monitoring," or "ecological monitoring" to find relevant repositories.
