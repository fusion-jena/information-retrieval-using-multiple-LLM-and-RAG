The provided context discusses the use of data augmentation as a technique to address data limitations in a deep learning pipeline for soundscape classification. However, it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. Therefore, I will provide a general overview of some common techniques used to address data bias.

Data bias can occur when the training data does not accurately represent the true distribution of the target population. This can lead to poor generalization performance of the deep learning model. To address data bias, the following techniques can be used during preprocessing:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the data into subgroups based on certain characteristics (e.g., class labels) and then ensuring that each subgroup is proportionally represented in the training, validation, and test sets. This can help ensure that the model is trained on a diverse set of examples and is less likely to be biased towards certain classes.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of examples in the minority class to balance the class distribution. This can help prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class. However, oversampling can lead to overfitting if not done carefully.
3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of examples in the majority class to balance the class distribution. This can help prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class. However, undersampling can lead to loss of information if not done carefully.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from a diverse set of sources to ensure that the training data is representative of the true population. This can help prevent the model from being biased towards certain sources or classes.

In the context of soundscape classification, data bias can occur if certain sound classes are overrepresented or underrepresented in the training data. To address this, the authors used data augmentation by splitting the merged .wav training file for each species in half and then adding these two halves sample-wise. This technique can help increase the diversity of the training data and prevent the model from being biased towards certain sound classes.
