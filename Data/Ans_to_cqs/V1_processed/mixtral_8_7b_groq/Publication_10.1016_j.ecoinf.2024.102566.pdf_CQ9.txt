The provided context does not explicitly mention the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of the GIMMS NDVI3g dataset and forest inventory data for the study. It is also stated that the research serves as a foundation for regional-scale forest carbon estimation using field-collected data and machine learning methods. Therefore, it is possible that the data repository may be disclosed in subsequent publications or reports related to this study.

In the context, the authors emphasize the importance of high-quality training samples and the layout of sampling points for constructing accurate and reliable models for biomass estimation. They also mention employing a method with low data dependency that integrates forest inventory data with remote sensing imagery for biomass estimation. These statements suggest that the data used in the study may be a combination of field-collected data and remote sensing data, which may be stored in different repositories.

To find the data repository, one could look for subsequent publications or reports related to this study or contact the authors directly. Additionally, one could search for the GIMMS NDVI3g dataset and forest inventory data used in the study in data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data repository for the deep learning pipeline, it is possible to find the data repository by searching for subsequent publications or reports related to the study or contacting the authors directly. One could also search for the GIMMS NDVI3g dataset and forest inventory data used in the study in data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
