The provided pieces of context do not directly discuss the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, they do mention various types of data used in different studies.

In the Nayeri et al. (2022b) study, the authors used occurrence records of target species to predict their distribution. While the context does not explicitly mention how these records were collected, they could have been obtained through various means such as field surveys, camera traps, or even extracted from existing databases or literature.

Pachauri et al. (2014) and Parmesan (2006) discuss climate change impacts on biodiversity, which implies the use of climate data. Climate data is typically obtained from meteorological stations, satellites, and reanalysis projects.

Guralnick and Pearman (2010) used species occurrence databases to determine niche dynamics, suggesting that their data was collected through various surveys and monitoring programs.

Hofer (1998), Hoffmann et al. (2018, 2020), and Huelber et al. (2020) do not provide specific details about data collection methods. Still, they likely used a combination of field surveys, expert knowledge, and existing databases for their studies on hyaena, golden jackal, and alpine species.

In summary, the raw data for a deep learning pipeline in ecological studies can be collected using various methods, including:

1. Field surveys: These can be targeted surveys for specific species or general biodiversity surveys using methods such as point counts, transects, or camera traps.
2. Existing databases: Researchers can use data from various databases, such as GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility), or other regional or national databases.
3. Public datasets: Researchers can utilize public datasets, such as climate data from meteorological stations or satellites.
4. Literature: Data can be extracted from existing literature, especially for historical analyses.

It is important to note that the specific data collection methods depend on the research question and the study system.
