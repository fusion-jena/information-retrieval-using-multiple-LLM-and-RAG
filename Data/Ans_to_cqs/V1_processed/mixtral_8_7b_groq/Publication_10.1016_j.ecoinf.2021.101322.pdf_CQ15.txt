The specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the CNN was implemented using the Keras and TensorFlow software packages in Python. Both of these packages support a variety of optimization algorithms, including Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad, among others.

 Given that the authors used transfer learning with a pre-trained EfficientNet-B4 model, it is likely that they fine-tuned the model using a variant of SGD or Adam. These optimization algorithms are commonly used for fine-tuning pre-trained models, as they can adapt the learning rate for each parameter individually, allowing for more efficient learning.

 However, without explicit information in the context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.

 An optimization technique is an algorithm that adjusts the parameters of a model during training to minimize the loss function. Common optimization techniques include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad. These algorithms adjust the learning rate for each parameter individually, allowing for more efficient learning.
