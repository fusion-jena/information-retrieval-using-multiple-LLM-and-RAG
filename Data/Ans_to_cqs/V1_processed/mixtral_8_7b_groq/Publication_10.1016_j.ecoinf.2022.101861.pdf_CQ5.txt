Based on the provided context, it appears that the query is asking about deep learning datasets, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, the context does not provide information about any deep learning pipelines or the use of these specific datasets. Instead, the context focuses on bird research and acoustic data analysis using the Kaleidoscope Pro software.

In the bird research context, the following datasets are mentioned:

1. Xeno-canto: This is a collection of bird sounds, which was used to characterize the song parameters of the Nighthawk. Specifically, eight recordings from the State of Mato Grosso were analyzed.
2. eBird: This is a citizen science project that collects bird observation data. As of May 2021, over one billion observations had been recorded.

However, these datasets are related to bird research and acoustic data analysis, not deep learning. Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query about deep learning datasets.
