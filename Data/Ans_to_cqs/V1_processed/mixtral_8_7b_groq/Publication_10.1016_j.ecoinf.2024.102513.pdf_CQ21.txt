After the model training process, there are several postprocessing steps that can be involved, such as calculating various metrics, generating a confusion matrix, and creating saliency maps. However, based on the given context, only the calculation of classification accuracy using specific metrics and the creation of a Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) map are explicitly mentioned.

First, the accuracy calculation is performed for each model trained on the corresponding period using the sklearn library. The exact metrics used for evaluation are not specified in the context, but it can be inferred that overall accuracy is one of the metrics since it is a common evaluation metric for classification tasks.

Second, a Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) map is generated based on the model's predictions. Each pixel in the LULC map represents the class to which it belongs, according to the model's predictions. This map is the ultimate result of the classification process.

As for saliency maps, the given context does not mention anything about generating saliency maps after the model training process. Saliency maps are a visualization tool used to highlight the important features that the model has learned during training. They can be useful for understanding the decision-making process of the model and identifying any potential biases or weaknesses in the model.

In summary, based on the given context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include calculating classification accuracy using metrics like overall accuracy and generating a Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) map. However, there is no mention of generating saliency maps or creating a confusion matrix.
