The provided context discusses the use of data augmentation as a regularization method to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline for plant classification. Specifically, during the training of the ResNet50 model, standard data augmentation techniques such as shear, translation, and mirroring are applied. However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of other regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization.

Data augmentation is a common technique used to increase the diversity of the training set by applying random transformations to the images, such as rotation, scaling, and flipping. In this case, the authors apply shear, translation, and mirroring, but they avoid rotation and upside-down mirroring for images labeled as 'habit' to maintain the orientation of trees and landscapes. After applying these transformations, the images are downscaled to the ResNet standard input size of 224x224.

While data augmentation is an effective regularization technique, it is not the only one. Dropout is another popular regularization method that randomly drops out a fraction of the neurons during training, preventing over-reliance on any single neuron and reducing overfitting. L2 regularization, on the other hand, adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights, encouraging smaller weight values and reducing overfitting.

Therefore, while the provided context discusses the use of data augmentation as a regularization method, it does not explicitly mention the use of dropout or L2 regularization. It is possible that the authors used these methods in addition to data augmentation, but the context does not provide enough information to confirm this.
