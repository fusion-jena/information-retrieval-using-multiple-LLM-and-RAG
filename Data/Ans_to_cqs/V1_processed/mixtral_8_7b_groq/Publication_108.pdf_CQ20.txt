The deep learning model was trained using eight high-end GPGPUs (General Purpose Graphic Processing Units) from NVIDIA, specifically Tesla P100 models. Each of these GPUs comes with 16 GB of RAM. This setup indicates that the training of the model was performed using substantial hardware resources, which are typically required for deep learning tasks due to their computational intensity. It is not mentioned if TPUs (Tensor Processing Units), which are custom-built chips developed by Google for machine learning tasks, were used. Based on the information provided, the training was conducted using a powerful GPU-based system.
