The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of environmental cross-validation and Bayesian optimization. Specifically, for each species-specific productivity model of B. edulis, H. repandum, L. deliciosus, M. procera, and T. portentosum, the hyperparameters of the random forest models were tuned using Bayesian optimization. This optimization was focused on reducing the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the predictions. The environmental cross-validation was carried out with ten folds, as implemented in the R package “mlr3mbo”.

The search space of optimal hyperparameters was defined by the ranges of “mtry” (number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split), “min.node.size” (minimum size of terminal nodes), and “num.trees” (number of trees to grow). These hyperparameters are part of the ranger R package, which was used to train the productivity models.

By using this strategy, the model performance was monitored during the training process, allowing for the identification of the best set of hyperparameters for each species-specific productivity model. This approach helped in finding consistent nonlinear ecological relationships among a large number of predictors, which was essential given that mushroom productivity is closely related to short-term weather conditions in Mediterranean environments.

In summary, the strategy to monitor the model performance during training consisted of using environmental cross-validation with ten folds and Bayesian optimization to tune the hyperparameters of the random forest models, focusing on reducing the RMSE of the predictions. This allowed for the identification of the best set of hyperparameters for each species-specific productivity model, ensuring the accurate prediction of mushroom productivity based on environmental conditions.
