The provided context does not give specific information about the learning rate or the optimizer used in the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the weights of a pre-trained VGGnet are fine-tuned using the Benthoz15 dataset. VGGnet is a type of convolutional neural network (CNN) that is commonly trained using some variant of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as the optimizer, and the learning rate is often scheduled to decrease over time. The specific hyperparameters used in this case are not provided in the context.

The context also mentions that the multi-scale deep features were used to train a Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) network for classification. An MLP is a type of neural network with multiple fully connected hidden layers, and it is often trained using backpropagation and an optimizer such as SGD or Adam. The learning rate and other hyperparameters for this MLP are also not provided in the context.

In summary, while the context provides information about the type of deep learning models used (a fine-tuned VGGnet and an MLP) and the pre-processing steps applied to the data, it does not provide specific information about the learning rate or the optimizer used in these models.
