The provided context does not contain specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model for forest aboveground biomass estimation. The context mentions the use of deep learning-based retrieval for forest biomass estimation (Zhang et al., 2019) but does not provide details about the deep learning model or its hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional information.
