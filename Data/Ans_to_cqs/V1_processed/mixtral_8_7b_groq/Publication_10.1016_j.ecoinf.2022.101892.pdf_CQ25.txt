The deep learning model described in the given context is used for the task of age estimation in panda facial images. The model is built using PyTorch and trained on Nvidia V100 GPU. It was pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and then fine-tuned on the PAD Full and PAD Lite datasets. A five-fold subject-exclusive method was applied to ensure that the same subject did not appear in the training and testing sets simultaneously. The images were downscaled to a resolution of 224 x 224 pixels before feeding them to seven models. To avoid overfitting and imbalanced problem, aggressive data augmentation was applied.

For feature extraction, VGG-11-BN and VGG-16-BN models were selected. The last three fully-connected layers of the original VGG model were replaced with one fully-connected layer to reduce parameters. Batch Normalization was adopted to accelerate the training of networks.

The performance of the model was evaluated based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values and inference-time. The inference-time was measured under real-world conditions with a batch size of 400 to achieve 100% GPU utilization.

Therefore, the deep learning model described in the given context is specifically designed for the task of age estimation in panda facial images, using a combination of pre-training, fine-tuning, data augmentation, and feature extraction techniques.
