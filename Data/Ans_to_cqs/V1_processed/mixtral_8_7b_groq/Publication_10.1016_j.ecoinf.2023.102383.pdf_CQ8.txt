I am unable to provide the code repository location for the deep learning pipeline you mentioned as there was no information about it in the provided context. The context includes information about various studies and models that use ResNet and FPN for object detection, but it does not mention where the code for these models is hosted. It is possible that the code is not publicly available, or it may be hosted on a platform other than GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. If you have more information about the specific deep learning pipeline you are interested in, I may be able to help you locate the code repository.
