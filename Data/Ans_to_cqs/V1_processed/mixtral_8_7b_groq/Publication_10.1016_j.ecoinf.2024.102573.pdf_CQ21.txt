After model training, there are several postprocessing steps that can be involved, such as the calculation of various metrics, generation of confusion matrices, and the creation of saliency maps. However, based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps specifically mentioned are the calculation of several metrics and the generation of confusion matrices.

In the study, the authors trained several models using different frontends and evaluated their performance using various metrics such as accuracy, top-3 accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall. These metrics were calculated for each model and reported in Table 2 of the study.

Additionally, the authors generated confusion matrices for the base and best configurations of each frontend. Confusion matrices are a common tool used to evaluate the performance of classification models. They provide a visual representation of the number of correct and incorrect predictions made by the model for each class. The confusion matrices for the base and best configurations of each frontend are presented in Fig. 4 of the study.

It is important to note that the provided context does not mention any postprocessing steps related to saliency maps. Saliency maps are a visualization technique used to highlight the important features in the input data that the model used to make its predictions. While saliency maps can be a useful tool for understanding the decision-making process of a model, they are not specifically mentioned in the provided context.

Overall, based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after model training include the calculation of various metrics and the generation of confusion matrices.
