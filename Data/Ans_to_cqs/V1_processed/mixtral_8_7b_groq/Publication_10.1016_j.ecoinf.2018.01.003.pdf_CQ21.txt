Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the training of models such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, there are some clues that suggest certain postprocessing steps could be used.

In the context of the SVM-based model for predicting the distribution of the invasive tree Miconia calvescens in tropical rainforests (Pouteau et al., 2011), it is mentioned that the model's performance is evaluated using statistical metrics such as the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and the coefficient of determination (R²). Therefore, it can be inferred that Metrics calculation is one of the postprocessing steps.

In the context of the ANN model for predicting the groundwater remediation costs for drinking use based on the quality of the water resource (Qaderi & Babanejad, 2017), it is mentioned that the model's performance is evaluated using statistical metrics such as the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and the coefficient of determination (R²). Additionally, the model's output is compared with the actual values using a scatter plot. Therefore, it can be inferred that Metrics calculation and plotting are two of the postprocessing steps.

In the context of the ANFIS, SVM, and ANN soft-computing techniques for estimating daily global solar radiation in a warm sub-humid environment (Quej et al., 2017), it is mentioned that the model's performance is evaluated using statistical metrics such as the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and the coefficient of determination (R²). Additionally, a Taylor diagram is used to compare the models' performance. Therefore, it can be inferred that Metrics calculation and plotting are two of the postprocessing steps.

In summary, while there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the training of models such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, and Confusion matrix, there are some clues that suggest that Metrics calculation and plotting are two of the postprocessing steps.
