Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps applied after the model training. However, it does mention that the test dataset was used to assess the performance of the final optimized neural network. This implies that some form of metrics calculation was performed.

In the context of semantic segmentation, common postprocessing steps include:

1. **Metrics calculation:** This involves calculating various metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU), pixel accuracy, mean accuracy, and frequency weighted IoU to evaluate the performance of the model. The context mentions that Scenario 5 was selected as the optimal solution because it had the best values for IoU and accuracy.

2. **Generation of segmentation maps:** The model's predictions on the test dataset would be generated, which are essentially the segmentation maps for the input images. These maps would have different classes for different types of objects present in the image.

3. **Visualization:** The segmentation maps can be visualized for a better understanding of the model's performance. Tools like saliency maps can be used to highlight the areas of the image that the model is focusing on. However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of saliency maps.

4. **Confusion matrix:** Although not explicitly mentioned in the context, a confusion matrix can also be generated. It is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model (or segmentation model, in this case) on a set of test data for which the true values are known. It allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm and can be used to derive further metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score.

In conclusion, while the context does not provide explicit information about the postprocessing steps, it can be inferred that metrics calculation was performed. Other common steps such as generation of segmentation maps, visualization, and confusion matrix might have been carried out but are not mentioned in the provided context.
