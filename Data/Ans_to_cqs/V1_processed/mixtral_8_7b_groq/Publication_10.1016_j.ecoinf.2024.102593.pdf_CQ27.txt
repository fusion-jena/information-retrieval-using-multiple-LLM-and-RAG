The provided context discusses the training of deep learning models for bird species classification, but it does not explicitly mention the process followed for deploying a trained model. However, it does give some insights into the steps that could be taken for model deployment.


The deep learning models, such as SincNet and ResNet152-architecture, are trained using the BirdNET-Analyzer v2.1 models and the BirdCLEF 2020 and NIPS4Bplus datasets. The models are trained on specific bird species, and for BirdCLEF 2020, only the "complementary train extract" is used to allow comparisons of the performance of BirdNET and the trained models on unseen classes.

Once the models are trained, they can be deployed for real-world use, such as running them through field recordings to detect and classify bird species. The context suggests that the authors rely on an interactive visualization tool called EV (short for Explorable Visualization) to select possible calls of the Coxen's fig-parrot during deployment.

Therefore, the process for deploying the trained deep learning model could involve the following steps:

1. Model serialization: The trained deep learning model needs to be saved in a format that can be loaded and run on a target platform. Model serialization involves saving the model architecture, weights, and other relevant information in a file format such as HDF5, JSON, or Protocol Buffers.
2. Platform selection: The target platform for model deployment could be a local machine, a cloud server, or an edge device such as a smartphone or a Raspberry Pi. The platform selection depends on the use case, such as the required processing power, memory, and latency.
3. Model loading: The serialized model is loaded into memory on the target platform.
4. Data preprocessing: The input data, such as audio recordings, are preprocessed to match the format and parameters expected by the model.
5. Model inference: The preprocessed data is fed into the model, and the model generates predictions for the bird species present in the input data.
6. Result visualization: The model predictions are visualized using a tool such as EV to facilitate the selection of possible calls of the target bird species.

Overall, the provided context suggests that the trained deep learning models are deployed using a combination of model serialization, platform selection, and result visualization techniques. However, the exact details of the deployment process are not provided in the context.
