The type of deep learning model used in the described pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is inferred from the various details provided about the model's architecture and design. 

Firstly, the model is based on a ResNet (Residual Network), which is a type of CNN. ResNets are known for their ease of implementation and scalability in width and depth, making them suitable for various training scenarios. The specific ResNet used in this case has scaling factors of K = 4 and N = 3, resulting in a sequence of 157 layers, 36 of which are weighted. 

Secondly, the model uses convolutions with 3 × 3 kernels, padding, batch normalization, and ReLU activation. These are all typical components of a CNN. 

Thirdly, the input to the model is a single-channel mel spectrogram of size 64 × 384, which is a common preprocessing step for audio data in CNN-based models. 

Lastly, the model uses global log-mean-exponential pooling and sigmoid activation for probability predictions, which are also common in CNNs. 

Therefore, based on the provided context, the deep learning model used in this pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
