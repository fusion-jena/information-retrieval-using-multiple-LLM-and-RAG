Based on the provided context, there is no information suggesting that training is complete when a validation loss plateau is reached. Instead, the model's performance is evaluated using two specific criteria: the Area Under the receiver-operator Curve (AUC) and the True Skill Statistics (TSS). 

The AUC measures the model's accuracy in predicting the species distribution, with values closer to 1 indicating a higher accuracy. The TSS, on the other hand, evaluates the agreement between the observed and predicted distributions, ranging from -1 (worst performance) to +1 (perfect agreement). 

In addition to these two criteria, the Akaike Information Criterion corrected for small sample sizes (AICc) is used to assess the goodness-of-fit and complexity of the model. The model with the lowest AICc value is considered the best model, and all models with a Î”AICc value of less than 2 are generally considered to have substantial support.

Therefore, based on the given context, the completion of training is not determined by a validation loss plateau but rather by the evaluation of the model's performance using AUC, TSS, and AICc.
