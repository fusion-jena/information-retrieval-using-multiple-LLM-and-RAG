The provided context discusses the use of a regularization method in the EfficientNetV2 network, specifically dropout in the MBConv block.

The MBConv block, used in the EfficientNetV2 network, consists of several layers including a depthwise convolution and a dropout layer. Dropout is a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting in deep learning models. During training, dropout randomly sets a fraction rate of input units to 0, which helps to make the model more robust and prevents overfitting by reducing the co-adaptation of neurons.

In addition to dropout, other regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines include L1 and L2 regularization. L1 regularization adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of the coefficients, while L2 regularization adds a penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients. These regularization techniques work by adding a penalty to the loss function, which encourages the model to have smaller weights and thus be less prone to overfitting.

The context also discusses the use of an improved progressive learning approach in the EfficientNetV2 network, which dynamically adjusts the regularization method based on the training image size. This method can improve the training speed and accuracy of the network.

In summary, the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines include dropout, L1 and L2 regularization. The EfficientNetV2 network uses dropout in the MBConv block and an improved progressive learning approach that dynamically adjusts the regularization method based on the training image size.
