The provided context does not give specific details about the learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model. However, it does mention that a Siamese network was trained using few-shot learning for animal tracking. Siamese networks typically use a contrastive loss function, and the optimization process involves adjusting the weights of the network to minimize this loss. The specific hyperparameters used would depend on the implementation and configuration of the model.

In the context of animal tracking, the authors of the study mentioned that they used a dataset with a limited number of samples. To address this, they employed few-shot learning, where the classification task is defined as an N-way K-shot problem. This means that the training set contains N different categories, each with K labeled samples. In the case of the tracking tasks, two categories were defined: target and non-target.

The authors performed experiments using two-way one-shot learning, which implies that each category in the training set has only one labeled sample. This is a challenging scenario, as the model has to generalize well from very few examples. The choice of hyperparameters, such as the learning rate and optimizer, would be crucial in this situation to ensure that the model converges to a good solution and avoids overfitting.

In summary, while the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are not provided in the context, it is important to note that the authors used few-shot learning for training a Siamese network in an animal tracking application. The choice of hyperparameters, such as the learning rate and optimizer, would significantly impact the performance of the model in such a challenging scenario.
