Based on the provided context, it is not explicitly stated which type of deep learning model is being used (e.g., classification, segmentation, detection). However, there are several clues that suggest the model is being used for sound or acoustic classification.

First, the context mentions the use of automated signal recognition software for monitoring cryptic and nocturnal bird species. This software is used to extract sounds that satisfy certain signal parameters and save the output. This process is similar to sound or acoustic classification, where the model identifies and categorizes different sounds or signals in an audio recording.

Additionally, the context mentions a study by LeBien et al. (2020) that developed a pipeline for identifying bird and frog species in tropical soundscape recordings using a convolutional neural network (CNN). CNNs are a type of deep learning model commonly used for image classification, but they can also be used for sound classification.

Furthermore, the context mentions the use of machine learning and BirdNET app for citizen science participation in global bird research. BirdNET is a mobile app that uses deep learning to identify bird songs and calls. This again suggests the use of deep learning for sound or acoustic classification.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is being used for sound or acoustic classification. However, the exact type of model and its specific details are not provided in the context.
