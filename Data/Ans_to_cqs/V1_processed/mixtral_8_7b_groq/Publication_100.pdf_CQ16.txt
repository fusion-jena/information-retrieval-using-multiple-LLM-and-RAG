The training of the models is considered complete when the validation loss does not improve for 15 consecutive epochs. This is a common practice in machine learning, where a predetermined patience level is set for the model to monitor the performance on a validation set. If the loss does not decrease for the specified number of epochs, the learning rate is automatically reduced by a factor of 0.1. This strategy is known as step-wise learning rate decay and it helps in fine-tuning the model and avoiding overfitting. The training process continues with the reduced learning rate, and the validation loss is observed again for another 15 epochs. This cycle repeats until the validation loss stops improving, at which point the training is considered complete.
