The provided context does not give detailed information on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does provide some insights into the training and optimization of the model.

The model is a hierarchical attention-based recurrent highway network for predicting 137Cs concentrations in sedimentary particulate matter (SPM) using exogenous variables from rivers. The training of the model involves standardizing the data, with one of the three datasets used as a training base to calculate and apply standardization parameters to the other two datasets considered as test bases. The best result of the optimization is used to determine the base that will be used for training.

The model optimization involves determining hyperparameters and parameter training using a custom HyperBand algorithm for optimizing the network architecture with the optimal length of the history. The methods were written in the Python language and in the PyCharm environment, using the Keras library with Tensorflow backend.

Therefore, we can infer that the trained deep learning model was likely serialized using Python and Keras, which provides a simple way to save the model architecture and weights to a file. Once the model is serialized, it can be deployed to a platform of choice, such as a web server or an edge device, depending on the use case.

In summary, while the provided context does not give detailed information on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, we can infer that the model was likely serialized using Python and Keras and deployed to a platform of choice. The training and optimization of the model involved standardizing the data, determining hyperparameters, and parameter training using a custom HyperBand algorithm.
