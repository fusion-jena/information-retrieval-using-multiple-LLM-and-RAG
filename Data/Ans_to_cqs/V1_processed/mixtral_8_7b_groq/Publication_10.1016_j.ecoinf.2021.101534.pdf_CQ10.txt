I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The context includes information about a case study that uses a CNN-based model for automated information extraction from soundscape recordings, with a mAP of 0.83. It also mentions other studies and databases, such as GBIF, that are related to biodiversity and deep learning. However, there is no information about the code repository or where the implementation of the deep learning pipeline can be found. I hope this information is helpful, and I apologize for not being able to provide the exact link to the code repository.
