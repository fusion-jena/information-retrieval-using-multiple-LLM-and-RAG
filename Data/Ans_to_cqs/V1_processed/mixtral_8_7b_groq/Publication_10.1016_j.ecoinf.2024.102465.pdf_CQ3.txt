The provided context does not specifically mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of HRNet for semantic segmentation, which is a type of data annotation.

Semantic segmentation is the process of dividing an image into multiple segments or regions, where each region is labeled with a specific class or category. HRNet, which is used in the study, effectively performs semantic segmentation by simultaneously merging high-resolution and low-resolution convolution computations.

In the context of social media image data, semantic segmentation can be used to identify and label green spaces, sky, and other elements in the image. The formulas described by Wu et al. (2023) can then be used to derive the greenness, blueness, and sky openness index from the labeled data.

Other data annotation techniques commonly used in deep learning include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing a box around an object in an image to identify and locate it. Bounding box annotation is often used in object detection tasks.
2. Instance segmentation: This technique involves labeling each instance of an object in an image. Instance segmentation is more detailed than semantic segmentation, as it not only identifies the class or category of an object but also distinguishes between different instances of the same class.
3. Landmark annotation: This technique involves identifying and labeling specific points or landmarks on an object in an image. Landmark annotation is often used in facial recognition and pose estimation tasks.

In summary, while the provided context does not specifically mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it does mention the use of HRNet for semantic segmentation. Other common data annotation techniques include bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, and landmark annotation.
