The context provided does not explicitly list the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of data augmentation to enhance the dataset and improve the accuracy of birdsong classification. Common data augmentation techniques for image data include flipping, rotating, and scaling. These techniques can help increase the size of the training set, reduce overfitting, and improve the model's ability to generalize.

In the context, the authors use data augmentation in the form of ACGAN (Adversarial Conditional Generative Adversarial Network) to address the low classification accuracy caused by the lack of birdsong spectrogram data. ACGAN is a conditional GAN that not only generates data but also classifies the generated data. By using ACGAN for data augmentation, the authors can generate additional birdsong spectrograms and improve the classifier's performance.

In addition to data augmentation, the context also discusses the use of dynamic convolution to improve the feature extraction capability of the network. Dynamic convolution involves using a set of parallel convolution kernels instead of a single convolution kernel per layer. These parallel convolutional kernels are dynamically aggregated by attention, allowing the network to adaptively adjust the weight of each convolution kernel according to the input. This structure has been shown to achieve a 2.9% gain in the ImageNet classification task and a 2.9 AP gain in the CoCo Key.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly list the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it does mention the use of data augmentation in the form of ACGAN and dynamic convolution to improve the performance of the classifier. Common data augmentation techniques for image data include flipping, rotating, and scaling.
