The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss data augmentation (DA), which is a technique used to increase and diversify training data. DA creates modified copies of a dataset using existing data, but it does not specify the type of annotations used.

Common data annotation techniques used in deep learning include:

1. Image classification: In this technique, an image is annotated with a single label that represents the overall content of the image.
2. Object detection: Here, an image is annotated with bounding boxes around objects of interest, along with their class labels.
3. Semantic segmentation: In this method, an image is annotated by dividing it into multiple regions, where each region is assigned a specific class label.
4. Instance segmentation: Similar to semantic segmentation, instance segmentation involves dividing an image into multiple regions, but each instance of an object is assigned a unique label.

The context mainly focuses on data augmentation and attention mechanisms, which help deep learning models to focus on relevant input elements. The proposed FAA-based approach divides the data into five folds, applies data augmentation policies, and trains a CNN model on each fold. The optimal augmentation policies are then selected based on the output of each CNN, controlled by a Bayesian optimizer.

In the SCAM-Herb model, attention mechanisms are implemented based on four pooling operations to enhance the performance of the proposed model. The results show that the DL model based on Tree-CA had promising performance and outperformed other state-of-the-art models.

In summary, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common annotation techniques include image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation.
