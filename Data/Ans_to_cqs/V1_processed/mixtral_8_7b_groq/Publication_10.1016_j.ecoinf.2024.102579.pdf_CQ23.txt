Based on the provided context, there is no information about a deep learning model. The text discusses a study that compares different estimators for measuring forest diversity indices. However, I can provide some insights on the generalizability of the methods used in this study.

The study does not explicitly mention using cross-validation or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of the results. However, they did use simulations and compared the performance of different estimators across two different forest inventories (Kammer and Hirschlacke). This approach can be seen as a way to test the robustness of the estimators since they were evaluated on different datasets.

The dataset used in the study is diverse, as it includes various diversity indices (Table 1 in the text) and two forest inventories. Moreover, the authors considered the effect of the number of nearest neighbors (k) on the performance of the estimators. This approach helps to assess the robustness of the estimators under different conditions.

In summary, while the study does not explicitly mention using cross-validation or stratified splitting, it did use simulations and compared the performance of different estimators across two different forest inventories. Additionally, the study considered a diverse dataset with various diversity indices and the effect of the number of nearest neighbors. These methods provide some insights into the generalizability of the results. However, for a deep learning model, it would be essential to use cross-validation and possibly stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of the model.
