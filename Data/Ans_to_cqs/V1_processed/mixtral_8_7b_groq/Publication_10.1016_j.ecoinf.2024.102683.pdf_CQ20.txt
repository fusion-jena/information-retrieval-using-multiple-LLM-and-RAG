The context provided does not give specific details about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that data augmentation techniques are used to increase and diversify the training data, which can help improve the generalization ability of the network. This suggests that the training process requires significant computational power.

In general, deep learning models often require high-performance hardware for training, such as graphics processing units (GPUs) or tensor processing units (TPUs). These specialized hardware components can perform parallel computations, which is essential for handling the large number of operations required for training deep learning models.

GPUs are commonly used for deep learning tasks due to their ability to perform matrix and vector operations efficiently. They are available in various configurations, ranging from consumer-grade graphics cards to high-end servers with multiple GPUs.

TPUs are specialized hardware developed by Google for machine learning tasks. They are designed to accelerate tensor operations, which are the fundamental building blocks of deep learning models. TPUs are available in cloud-based services, such as Google Cloud Platform, and can be used for training large-scale deep learning models.

Therefore, while the context does not provide specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, it is likely that high-performance hardware, such as GPUs or TPUs, were used to handle the computational requirements of the training process.
