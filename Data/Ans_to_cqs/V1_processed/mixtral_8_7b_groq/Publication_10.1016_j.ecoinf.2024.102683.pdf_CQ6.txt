Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved, such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning. However, the provided context does not explicitly mention these steps in relation to deep learning model training.

The context does mention data augmentation (DA) as a technique used to increase and diversify training data. DA involves creating modified copies of the existing dataset, which can help prevent overfitting and improve the generalization ability of the network. While DA can be considered a form of data preprocessing, it is distinct from the more traditional preprocessing steps of normalization, scaling, and cleaning.

In the proposed FAA-based approach, the data is divided into five equal folds, and policies are used to augment each fold without repetition. The output of each CNN is controlled by a Bayesian optimizer, and weak policies are removed while strong ones are selected. This process continues to find the optimal policies for data augmentation.

The context also discusses the use of attention mechanisms to enhance the efficiency of DL networks by allowing them to precisely focus on all relevant input elements. The CA model is implemented based on four pooling operations, including global average pooling-based CA, mixed pooling-based CA, gated pooling-based CA, and tree pooling-based CA operations.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention normalization, scaling, or cleaning as preprocessing steps for deep learning model training, it does mention data augmentation and attention mechanisms as techniques used to improve model performance.
