The data formats used in the deep learning pipeline in the provided studies are images.

In the first study about Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) published in the Proceedings of the 5th ACM on International Conference on Multimedia Retrieval (ICMR ‘15), the authors used the ImageNet dataset, which is a benchmark dataset in the field of computer vision. Each image in the ImageNet dataset is manually annotated, and the image sizes vary, with the largest size being 4288 × 2848 pixels and the smallest being 75 × 56 pixels. The authors used the pre-trained model on the ImageNet-1 k dataset as one of the source models for transfer learning.

In the second study published in Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) 2017, the authors used three significantly different datasets: ImageNet, Snapshot Serengeti (SS), and Lasha Mountain (LSM). The SS and LSM datasets are camera trap image datasets, where each time the camera is triggered, it captures multiple images in succession, called a capture event. The authors kept the integrity of events during data splitting, putting all images of an event into the same dataset.

Therefore, based on the provided pieces of context, the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are images.
