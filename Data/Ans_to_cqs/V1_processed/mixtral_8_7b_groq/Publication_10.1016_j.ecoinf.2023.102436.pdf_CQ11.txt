Based on the provided context, there is no direct link to a data repository for the deep learning pipeline. However, the study by J. Qi et al. (2024) mentions that the data will be made available on request. Additionally, the supplementary data can be found online at <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2023.102436>. It is possible to request the deep learning pipeline data by contacting the authors or the Ministry of Education - Singapore, which financially supported the study.

The study by Bayr and Puschmann (2019) applied a convolutional neural network for the automatic recognition of woody regrowth vegetation in repeat landscape photographs. While this study does not directly provide a data repository link for their deep learning pipeline, it demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques for landscape analysis.

In summary, while there is no direct link to a data repository for the deep learning pipeline in the provided context, the data will be made available upon request. You may contact the authors or the study's sponsor for more information.
