The provided context discusses the data formats used in the specific context of remote sensing images and their processing, but it does not directly mention the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline that includes various types of data such as image, audio, video, and CSV. However, based on the general knowledge of deep learning and the information provided in the context, we can make some educated guesses.

In the context of remote sensing images, the data formats mentioned are raster images, which are typically stored in formats such as GeoTIFF or JPEG2000. These formats are suitable for storing large multispectral or hyperspectral images that are commonly used in remote sensing applications.

In the case of other types of data, such as audio, video, or CSV, the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline would depend on the specific application and the tools used for processing. For example, for audio data, formats such as WAV or MP3 might be used, while for video data, formats such as MP4 or AVI might be used. For tabular data, such as CSV, the data format is already specified.

Moreover, in the context of nasawebservice, the data formats used for data exchange are text/csv or application/json, following the common MIME types guidelines. These formats are commonly used for exchanging data between different systems and are suitable for use in a deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline, it is reasonable to assume that the data formats used would depend on the specific application and the tools used for processing. However, raster image formats, such as GeoTIFF or JPEG2000, are likely to be used for remote sensing images, while other formats, such as WAV, MP3, MP4, AVI, or CSV, might be used for other types of data.
