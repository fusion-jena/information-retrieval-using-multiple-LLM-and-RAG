The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using a training set that consists of 80% of each dialect class, resulting in a total of 1561 training songs. The training process also includes 2 new dialect classes, and no additional preprocessing is applied to the spectrograms. This is done to demonstrate the power of human-machine teaming and to minimize preprocessing.

To further evaluate the model's performance, the accuracy of the CNN on noise-filtered data is compared with that of raw data. The results show that the CNN's accuracy on filtered data averages to 99.22%, while the accuracy on non-filtered data averages to 99.25%. This suggests that the model performs well on both filtered and raw data.

Additionally, the test data consists of the remaining 20% of each of the other dialect classes, totaling 700 test songs. The test set is used to assess the model's ability to generalize and identify dialect classes accurately. The test data is divided into several categories, including match, both correct, match, both incorrect, mismatch, CNN correct, mismatch, k-NN correct, and mismatch, both incorrect.

The test results show that the model correctly identifies 460 songs, while there are 455 mismatches where both the model and the k-NN are incorrect. There are also some cases where only one of the models is incorrect.

Overall, the strategy for monitoring the model's performance during training involves using a large and diverse training set, comparing the model's performance on filtered and raw data, and evaluating the model's ability to generalize and accurately identify dialect classes using a separate test set.
