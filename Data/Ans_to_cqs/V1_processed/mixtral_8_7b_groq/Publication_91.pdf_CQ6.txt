The provided context discusses a specific study that uses deep learning models for pollen species identification using a multispectral imaging flow cytometry system. While the text does not explicitly mention general preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning, it does describe several data preparation methods applied to their specific dataset.


In the study, the following preprocessing steps were applied before training the deep learning model:

1. Data splitting: The dataset was divided into three sets for training, validation, and testing, in the proportions of 80%, 10%, and 10%, respectively.

2. Center cropping: All images were center cropped to an equally sized rectangle to ensure consistent dimensions.

3. Data augmentation: To increase the robustness and generalization of the classifier, the training set images underwent several augmentation techniques, including horizontal and vertical flipping, brightness adjustment (12.5%), saturation adjustment (50.0%), contrast adjustment (12.5%), and hue adjustment (20%).

4. Channel normalization: Although not explicitly stated, it is common practice in deep learning to normalize input channels. In this case, each of the 12 channels could have been normalized individually using techniques such as z-score normalization or min-max scaling.

These preprocessing steps demonstrate the importance of data preparation in deep learning model training. While the context does not mention other general preprocessing techniques like noise removal or outlier detection, these methods could also be applied depending on the specific dataset and problem at hand.
