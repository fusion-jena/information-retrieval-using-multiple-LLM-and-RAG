Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context focuses on the methods and data used for estimating forest biomass, including the use of field-collected data, remote sensing imagery, and forest inventory data. It also mentions the importance of high-quality training samples and machine learning methods for constructing accurate and reliable models. However, it does not specify the hardware resources employed for training the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
