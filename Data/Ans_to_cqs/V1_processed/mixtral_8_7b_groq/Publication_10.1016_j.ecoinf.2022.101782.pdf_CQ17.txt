The provided context discusses a deep learning pipeline used for red kite image classification, but it does not explicitly mention the use of regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting. However, there are other techniques mentioned that can help reduce overfitting.

One such technique is data augmentation, which was applied to the training set by performing horizontal flips, random rotations, and zooming. This increases the amount of training data and helps the model generalize better, ultimately reducing overfitting.

Another technique is transfer learning, where a pre-trained model (ResNet50) was used as the base for the red kite image classification model. By using a pre-trained model, the deep learning pipeline benefits from the knowledge gained from the large dataset the model was initially trained on, which helps improve performance and reduce overfitting.

Additionally, the learning rate of the ADAM optimizer was set to 1e-5, which is a relatively small value. This can help the model converge slowly, allowing it to learn more effectively and potentially reducing overfitting.

Lastly, the final 1000-way classification layer of the pre-trained model was replaced with two additional, fully connected layers with ReLu non-linearity activation followed by a 2-way logistic regression classifier. These layers add 1 million untrained parameters to the network which need to be tuned to detect red kites. Training these layers with a small learning rate can help the model converge slowly and learn more effectively, potentially reducing overfitting.

While the context does not explicitly mention dropout or L2 regularization, the techniques used in this deep learning pipeline can still help reduce overfitting.
