The provided context does not contain information about deep learning pipelines or strategies employed to handle randomness in such pipelines, including the use of random seed values. The text focuses on the analysis of ecological data from various satellite-based remote sensing (SRS) services, specifically in the Campo de Cartagena (CC) region.

The authors use datasets from Sentinel, VIIRS, and MODIS services, and they present a figure (Fig. 6) that shows the number of valid samples for each SRS service in twelve different Integrated Systems for Monitoring the Phenology (ISMPs) during 2021. However, there is no mention of deep learning techniques or randomness handling strategies in this context.

To summarize, the provided context does not contain information on strategies employed to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines.
