The provided context does not give information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the training parameters and considerations when using DeepLabV3+ for image analysis with more than three input channels. It mentions the use of the default DeepLabV3+ architecture and future work to consider using more than three input channels. However, it does not provide a link or reference to the code repository used in the study. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
