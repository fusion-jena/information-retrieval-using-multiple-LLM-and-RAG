The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of cross-validation and the Area Under the Receiving Operator Characteristics Curve (AUC) index. Specifically, the dataset was divided into two parts, with 70% used for training the models and the remaining 30% used for testing. The models’ accuracy was then determined by calculating the AUC, which ranges from 0.5 to 1.0. A higher AUC value indicates a more accurate model. This approach was applied to an ensemble of four models, including one regression-based model and three machine-learning models (MaxEnt, RF, and SVM), to generate a final ensembled model for each species.
