The context provided does not give specific information about the learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning models. However, it does mention the use of a "Dropout layer" and "Global Average Pooling layer" in the models, as well as the application of the "Focal Loss" function in some instances.

The Dropout layer is a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting in neural networks by randomly dropping out (i.e., setting to zero) a certain percentage of neurons during training. The Global Average Pooling layer is used for summarizing features, generating input for the fully connected layer, and facilitating the visualization of regions relied upon by the network for predictions.

The Focal Loss function is a modification of the Cross-Entropy loss function that focuses on reducing the impact of straightforward samples on training loss while amplifying the significance of challenging ones. It is calculated using the probability of belonging to the class, the ratio of generated boxes containing background and foreground information, and a "concentration" parameter that controls the contribution of indistinguishable regions to the total loss of the model.
