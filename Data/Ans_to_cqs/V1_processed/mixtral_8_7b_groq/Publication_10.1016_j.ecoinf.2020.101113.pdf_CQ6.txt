In the context provided, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, include time-frequency input windowing and using a pre-trained model.

Firstly, the CNN model used in the study requires equally sized input images. The authors chose a time-frequency input window size of 2 seconds as it is near the mean and median template duration across target call types. This step is a form of data resizing or normalization, where the input data is transformed to have a consistent size and format.

Secondly, the authors used a ResNet50 model, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, which contains over one million photo images across 1000 classes. Although ImageNet does not contain spectrograms, models pre-trained with the dataset learn a variety of image features that have been successfully tuned to spectrogram classification previously. This step is known as transfer learning, where a model already optimized for a similar dataset is retrained with new data.

However, the context does not explicitly mention other common preprocessing steps such as data scaling, cleaning, or normalization. Scaling refers to transforming the data to have a consistent range or distribution, while cleaning involves removing or correcting errors or outliers in the data. These steps are crucial in reducing noise and improving the quality of the input data, which can significantly impact the performance of the deep learning model.

Therefore, while the context provides some insight into the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, it does not cover all the necessary steps. It is important to note that the specific preprocessing steps required may vary depending on the type of data and the deep learning model used.
