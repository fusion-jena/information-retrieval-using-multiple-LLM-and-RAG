I'm sorry, but the provided context does not include information about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link for it. The context mainly discusses a study of land use and land cover (LULC) changes in the Amazon region, including details about the study area, thematic classes, and spectral indices. However, it does not mention any deep learning pipeline or data repository link.
