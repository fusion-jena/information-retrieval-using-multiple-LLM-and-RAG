The training of the model is determined to be complete when the stopping criterion is reached, which is when successive model iterations do not reduce the F1 score. The F1 score is a validation metric that includes information on both model precision and recall. This means that the model stops improving in terms of its ability to accurately predict the desired outcomes and recall relevant data. The F1 score is used as the validation metric instead of validation loss because it provides a more comprehensive measure of the model's performance. A final model is then trained using the combined training and validation data. This approach of using a validation metric to determine when training is complete helps to minimize potential overfitting of the model on small sample sizes. Additionally, a grid search technique is used to tune hyperparameters of the final model, including the number of epochs, batch size, and learning rate. This ensures that the model's hyperparameters are optimized for the best possible performance.
