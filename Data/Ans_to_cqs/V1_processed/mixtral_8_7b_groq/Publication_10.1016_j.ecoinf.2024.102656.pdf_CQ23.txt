The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a deep learning model for predicting species distribution across the central Iranian plateau. However, it does discuss the use of ensemble modeling, which combines the predictions of multiple individual models to generate a more accurate and robust prediction. The individual models mentioned include GLM, MaxEnt, RF, GBM, and MARS, but not deep learning models.

In terms of measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the ensemble model, the context mentions the use of two widely recognized metrics for evaluating model performance: the area under the curve (AUC) and the true skill statistic (TSS). AUC values exceeding 0.9 were considered excellent, 0.9-0.8 as good, 0.8-0.7 as moderate, and < 0.7 as poor. TSS values were categorized as excellent (>0.75), good (0.75 to 0.4), and poor (<0.4). This comprehensive assessment ensures a robust understanding of model performance and aids in reliable predictions of species distribution.

Additionally, the context discusses the use of a weighted-averaging approach for generating the ensemble prediction, where weights are assigned to individual models based on their predictive accuracy on test data. This approach allows for the integration of the strengths of multiple models and reduces the impact of individual model weaknesses, thereby improving the overall generalizability of the ensemble model.

However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of the ensemble model. These techniques are commonly used in machine learning to prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data. Therefore, it is unclear whether these techniques were used in the development of the ensemble model.

In summary, while the context provides information on measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the ensemble model, it does not explicitly mention the use of a deep learning model or the use of a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.
