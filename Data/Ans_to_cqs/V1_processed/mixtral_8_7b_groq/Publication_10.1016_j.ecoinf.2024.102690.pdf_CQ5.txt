Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline used in this study does not involve any of the standard datasets commonly used in deep learning research, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, this study utilizes a variety of datasets specific to its research objectives, which focus on analyzing ecological sources and their relationships with other factors in a particular study area.

The datasets used in this study include:

1. GlobeLand30: This is a raster dataset providing land cover information at a spatial resolution of 30 meters.
2. ALOS World 3D-30 m: This dataset, provided by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, offers 3D elevation data at a 30-meter resolution.
3. China soil map based on the harmonized world soil database (HWSD) (v1.1): This dataset offers soil information for China.
4. MODIS image MOD13Q1: This raster dataset, provided by NASA, offers vegetation index data at a spatial resolution of 250 meters.
5. CRU dataset: This dataset provides climate data, including precipitation and evapotranspiration.
6. Guangzhou statistical yearbook and national grain trading center: These datasets offer information on grain prices.
7. Population density data: Although the specific source is not mentioned, it is likely a raster dataset with population density information.
8. Railway and expressway data: This is a vector dataset that provides information on transportation infrastructure.
9. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI): Although not explicitly mentioned as a separate dataset, NDVI is calculated from the MODIS image MOD13Q1 dataset.

The study also uses several other datasets for comparison and validation purposes, such as the National Earth System Science Data Center and Geographic Data Sharing Infrastructure from Peking University.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline in this study utilizes several specific datasets related to the study area and research objectives, rather than the standard deep learning benchmark datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
