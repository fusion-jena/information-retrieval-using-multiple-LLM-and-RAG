Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline for predicting air quality. The four research papers listed in the context focus on various aspects of air quality, such as predicting air quality with deep learning LSTM models, assessing nitrogen dioxide levels as a contributing factor to COVID-19 fatality, and carbon sequestration in fly ash deposits. However, they do not discuss data augmentation techniques.

Data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to increase the size of the training dataset and improve model performance. These techniques can help reduce overfitting and improve the generalization ability of the model.

Flipping involves horizontally flipping the images in the dataset, which can help the model learn symmetrical features. Rotating involves rotating the images at different angles, which can help the model learn features that are invariant to rotation. Scaling involves resizing the images to different scales, which can help the model learn features that are invariant to scale.

Without more specific information from the provided context, it is not possible to answer this query definitively. However, it is common practice to use data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling in deep learning pipelines for image classification tasks.
