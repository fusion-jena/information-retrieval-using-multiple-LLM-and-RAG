The provided context does not give specific details about the data pre-processing steps taken before training the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that the audio data were stored in different formats (FLAC and WAV) with varying sampling rates (44.1 kHz and 32 kHz). This suggests that some form of data pre-processing was performed to standardize the audio data before training the model.

In general, data pre-processing is an essential step in deep learning model development, and it often involves several steps such as data cleaning, normalization, and scaling. Data cleaning involves removing any irrelevant or corrupted data from the dataset. Normalization is the process of scaling numeric data to a common range, often between 0 and 1, to prevent any particular feature from dominating the learning process. Scaling is similar to normalization, but it involves transforming the data to have a specific distribution, such as a standard normal distribution.

In the context of audio data, data pre-processing may involve additional steps such as feature extraction, where relevant features such as spectral coefficients, Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), or chroma features are extracted from the raw audio data. These features are then used as input to the deep learning model.

Therefore, while the provided context does not give specific details about the data pre-processing steps taken, it is reasonable to assume that some form of data pre-processing was performed before training the deep learning model.
