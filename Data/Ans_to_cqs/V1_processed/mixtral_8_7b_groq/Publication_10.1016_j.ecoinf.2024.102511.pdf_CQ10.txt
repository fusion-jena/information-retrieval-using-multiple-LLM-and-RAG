I'm sorry, but the provided context does not include information about a specific deep learning pipeline and its corresponding code repository link on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. The context consists of various papers and reports related to image data augmentation for deep learning, passive acoustic surveys of deep-diving odontocetes, computational bioacoustics with deep learning, and marine mammal abundance and spatial distribution. While some of these papers might discuss deep learning pipelines, there is no mention of a specific code repository link.
