The deep learning model described in the given context is built using either TensorFlow or PyTorch frameworks, but the specific one is not explicitly mentioned. However, based on the techniques and methods used, we can make an educated guess that PyTorch is the more likely choice.

The model employs an MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) with four fully connected layers, each consisting of a linear layer followed by PReLU (Parametric Rectified Linear Unit) as non-linearity. Among these layers, only the third one has Batch Normalization, which is a technique to normalize the activations of the layer's inputs. During optimization, Batch Normalization was applied to other layers as well, but the network performance was not as good.

These techniques and layer types are more commonly found and easier to implement in PyTorch than TensorFlow. For instance, PyTorch has a built-in module for PReLU, while TensorFlow requires users to define a custom activation function. Similarly, PyTorch provides a straightforward way to implement Batch Normalization, whereas TensorFlow requires additional steps and code.

Moreover, the Adam optimizer and learning rate scheduler are used during the training of the MLP. The Adam optimizer is a popular choice for deep learning models due to its efficiency and adaptability. Both PyTorch and TensorFlow support the Adam optimizer, but PyTorch's implementation is more user-friendly.

Lastly, the model uses Cross-Entropy or Focal Loss as the loss function. Focal Loss is a more recent development and is not natively supported in TensorFlow 1.x. Although TensorFlow 2.x includes Focal Loss, PyTorch still has a more mature and user-friendly implementation.

Therefore, based on the techniques and methods used, it is more likely that the deep learning model is built using the PyTorch framework. However, it is essential to note that the provided context does not explicitly mention the framework used.
