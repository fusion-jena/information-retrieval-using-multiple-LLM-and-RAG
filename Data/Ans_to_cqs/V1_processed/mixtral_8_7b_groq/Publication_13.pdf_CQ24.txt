Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, there are some related discussions on the challenges and considerations when applying deep learning to biodiversity samples and computer vision tasks.

In the context of biodiversity samples, the authors of "Biodiversity samples using deep learning and domain adaptation" (2023) discuss the challenges of intra-class variability and inconsistencies in photographs. While they do not explicitly mention randomness in the deep learning pipeline, they emphasize the need for a powerful approach like domain adaptation to handle unknown samples and the variation in the composition of the training set.

In "Calibrating deep neural networks using focal loss" (2020), Mukhoti et al. introduce focal loss as a method to address class imbalance, which can be a source of randomness in the dataset. Focal loss adjusts the contribution of each sample to the loss function, reducing the impact of easy-to-classify samples and focusing on hard examples.

Schwartz and Alfaro (2021) present Sashimi, a toolkit for facilitating high-throughput organismal image segmentation using deep learning. Although they do not discuss randomness directly, they highlight the importance of preprocessing and data augmentation techniques to improve model performance and generalization.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value, it does discuss techniques for addressing class imbalance, data augmentation, and preprocessing. These methods can indirectly help manage randomness and improve deep learning model performance.
