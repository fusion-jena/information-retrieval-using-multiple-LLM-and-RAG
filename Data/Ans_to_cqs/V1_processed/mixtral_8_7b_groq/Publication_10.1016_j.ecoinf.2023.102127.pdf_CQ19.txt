The ibis.iSDM package supports a variety of engines for inferring or projecting the relative habitat suitability of biodiversity features. These engines can be classified into those using regressions, non-parametric machine learning approaches, and being frequentist or Bayesian in nature. However, the context does not mention any deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Deep learning models are a type of machine learning model that are particularly well-suited to handling large and complex datasets, and are typically built using specialized deep learning frameworks. The context does not provide enough information to determine which deep learning frameworks, if any, are used by the ibis.iSDM package. Therefore, it is not possible to answer the query regarding which deep learning frameworks are used to build the models in the ibis.iSDM package.
