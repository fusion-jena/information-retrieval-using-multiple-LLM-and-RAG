The provided context does not contain specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for water quality indicator (WQ) data. However, it does mention that the WQ data was divided into training and testing datasets for machine learning (ML) techniques. It can be inferred that the data was collected through some methods before being used in the ML models.

In general, there are various methods for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline, including but not limited to surveys, sensors, and public datasets. Surveys can be conducted to gather data directly from participants, while sensors can be used to collect data automatically from the environment. Public datasets, such as those available from government agencies or research institutions, can also be used as a source of raw data.

For example, in the study by Sakaa et al. (2022), water quality index (WQI) modeling was conducted using random forest and improved SMO algorithm for support vector machine in the Saf-Saf river basin. While the study does not explicitly mention the data collection method, it is likely that water quality data was collected using sensors or other automated methods.

In another study by Vu et al. (2022), a recurrent neural network model was developed for waste disposal rate estimation. The study analyzed input set characteristics and variances on k-fold cross validation, but it does not provide information on the data collection method.

Therefore, while the provided context does not contain specific information on the data collection methods for WQ data, it can be inferred that various methods such as surveys, sensors, and public datasets can be used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline.
