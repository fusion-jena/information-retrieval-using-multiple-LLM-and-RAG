The pieces of context provided do not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete in the described algorithm. However, they do give some insight into the process of training and optimization.

The algorithm described consists of two main steps: the least squares (LS) algorithm and the genetic algorithm (GA). The LS algorithm calculates the best fit parameter values, which are then used as input for the GA. The GA generates new combinations of initial values and stores them in a database, which is then ordered according to the sum of the residual values. This process can be repeated several times, and the number of times it is repeated is determined by the user.

Based on the context, it appears that the training process may be considered complete when a certain number of GA cycles have been executed. Specifically, the context mentions that the genetic algorithm cycle is repeated an arbitrary number of times, but for simplicity, they considered a nGAC = 2. This leads to a total number of nTGA = 2nGAC+1 â‹… nLSF = 1536 LS fit evaluations.

However, it is not clear from the context if this is the only criterion used to determine when training is complete or if other factors, such as validation loss plateau, are taken into account. It is possible that the algorithm includes additional criteria for determining when training is complete, but the context does not provide enough information to make a definitive conclusion.

In summary, based on the provided pieces of context, it appears that the training process may be considered complete after a certain number of GA cycles have been executed. However, it is not clear if other criteria, such as validation loss plateau, are taken into account.
