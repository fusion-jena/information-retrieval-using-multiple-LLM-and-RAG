Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific deep learning frameworks (such as TensorFlow or PyTorch) used to build the artificial neural network (ANN) model in the study. The text focuses on the methodology and results of the study, which involves using a NARX feedback ANN model to define vegetation biomass density for 2030, and combining it with wavelet analysis to create a hybrid model for improved performance.

However, it can be inferred that the ANN model was likely built using a general-purpose programming language or environment with data analysis and machine learning libraries, such as Python with scikit-learn or R with Keras. These environments are commonly used for implementing ANN models and are not specific to deep learning.

In conclusion, while the specific deep learning frameworks used in the study are not mentioned in the provided context, it is likely that a general-purpose programming language or environment with machine learning libraries was used to build the ANN model.
