The provided context discusses the use of a multiscale feature-extraction network (MSNet) and Res2Net modules for target tracking in a multiple object tracking (MOT) scenario in the context of the Deep SORT algorithm. It does not directly mention preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does discuss the importance of feature extraction at various scales and the challenges of maintaining effective information for targets of different sizes in the output feature maps.

In the original algorithm, MSNet constructs the feature extraction network by stacking rule residual blocks to capture the appearance information of the targets. However, due to the depth and structure of the network, it is challenging for the original residual network to extract the deeper features of the target. To address this, a deeper network with Res2Net modules and group convolution is introduced to replace the feature extraction network in the Deep SORT algorithm. This enhancement refines the multi-scale representation in the Deep SORT feature extraction network, achieving a more intricate and detailed level of feature extraction.

In the context of training a deep learning model, preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning are important for preparing the data and improving the model's performance. Normalization typically involves scaling the features to have zero mean and unit variance, which can help the model converge faster and improve its generalization ability. Scaling can also be important for features that have different units or ranges. Cleaning the data can involve removing or imputing missing values, handling outliers, and transforming the data to meet the assumptions of the model.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly mention preprocessing steps, it highlights the importance of feature extraction at various scales for target tracking in MOT scenarios. In the context of training a deep learning model, preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning are important for preparing the data and improving the model's performance.
