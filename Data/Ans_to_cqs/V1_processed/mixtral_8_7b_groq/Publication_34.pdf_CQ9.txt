The provided context does not give information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It includes details about the data used in the study, such as the selection of 1000 species (E1000) and a subset of 50 species (E50) used for comparison with baselines. It also describes the environmental data used, with various features and resolutions. However, it does not mention where the data or the deep learning pipeline is stored or made available for public access. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
