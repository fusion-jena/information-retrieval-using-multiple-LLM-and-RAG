Unfortunately, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query as none of the provided contexts mention a strategy for monitoring model performance during training.

The first context is an URL of a Medium article about improving cloud detection with machine learning, but it does not contain information on model performance monitoring.

The second and third contexts are citations of scientific articles, but they do not provide details on the training process or model performance monitoring of the machine learning models used in their research.

The fourth context is a table from a scientific article by Steinbach et al. (2023) that presents the results of a land use classification model, but it does not mention any strategy for monitoring model performance during training.

The fifth context is a scientific article by Dalponte et al. (2013) that focuses on tree species classification in boreal forests using hyperspectral data, but it does not discuss model performance monitoring during training.

The sixth context is a scientific article by Karambizi et al. (2019) that evaluates the potential impact of land use changes on ecosystem health in East Africa, but it does not provide information on model performance monitoring.

The seventh context is a table from a scientific article by Darrah et al. (2019) that presents the results of a wetland extent trends (WET) index model, but it does not mention any strategy for monitoring model performance during training.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given contexts.
