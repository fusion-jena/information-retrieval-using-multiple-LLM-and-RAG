The provided context does not explicitly mention which deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, were used to build the model. However, it does mention the use of a neural network (ANN) and the backpropagation algorithm, which are commonly implemented in deep learning frameworks.

The backpropagation algorithm, which is used for training neural networks, is mentioned as the heart of the machine learning tool used to generalize the concept of neighborhood relations. This algorithm is implemented in various deep learning frameworks, including TensorFlow and PyTorch.

Furthermore, the Gumbel-Softmax function, which is used to optimize neural networks involving discrete variables, is mentioned as a useful tool in the context. This function is implemented in both TensorFlow and PyTorch, which suggests that either of these frameworks could have been used to build the model.

Therefore, while the specific deep learning framework used to build the model is not mentioned in the provided context, it is likely that either TensorFlow or PyTorch was used, given the mention of the backpropagation algorithm and the Gumbel-Softmax function.
