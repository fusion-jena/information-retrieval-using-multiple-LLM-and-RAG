The two metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are the Intersection over Union (IoU) and the overall accuracy of the model.

The Intersection over Union (IoU) is a metric that computes the intersection of the reference dataset and the predicted classification, and divides it by the union of the two. It is a measure of the overlap between the predicted class and the ground truth class. A higher IoU value indicates a better overlap between the predicted and ground truth classes, and therefore a better model performance.

The overall accuracy of the model is another metric used to evaluate the model performance. It is calculated as the ratio of the correctly classified pixels to the total number of pixels. A higher accuracy value indicates that the model is correctly classifying a larger proportion of the pixels, and therefore a better model performance.

These two metrics were chosen because they provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model performance. The IoU measures the overlap between the predicted and ground truth classes, providing a measure of how well the model is able to identify the correct class. The overall accuracy provides a measure of the proportion of pixels that are correctly classified, providing a measure of the overall performance of the model.

It is important to note that due to the fact that the feed-forward neural network outputs a probability of a class rather than a class label, a threshold has to be set to obtain a confusion matrix and to be able to compute the evaluation metrics. In this study, a custom metric was implemented and operated according to the algorithm in Algorithm 1 to compute the mean intersection over union for thresholds between 0.5 and 1. This allowed for the evaluation of the model performance across a range of threshold values.
