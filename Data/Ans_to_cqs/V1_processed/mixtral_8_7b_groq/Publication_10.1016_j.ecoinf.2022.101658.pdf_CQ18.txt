The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model's performance was evaluated using semantic segmentation metrics, including mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and accuracy. These metrics were calculated for each fuel type class, including woody debris, forb, grass, lichen, feather moss, other moss, Sphagnum moss, non-fuel, shrub, and void.

The mIoU metric measures the overlap between the predicted and actual segmentation masks, providing a value between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates perfect overlap. Accuracy, on the other hand, measures the proportion of correctly classified pixels.

Additionally, the context suggests that the authors used a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model trained using field measurements collected at Pelican Mountain (PM) and Calling Lake (CL) field sites. The model's performance was likely monitored during training by evaluating the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data. Specifically, the authors used raw photos and field measurement data from the Conklin (CK) field site solely for independent validation.

However, the context does not provide information on whether the authors used techniques such as early stopping, learning rate scheduling, or regularization to prevent overfitting and improve the model's performance during training. Therefore, while the authors evaluated the model's performance using semantic segmentation metrics, the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model's performance during training remains unclear.
