Unfortunately, there is no specific code repository link provided in the context regarding the deep learning pipeline for vegetation science. However, there are some related resources that might be helpful.

The paper "Harnessing deep learning in ecology: An example predicting bark beetle outbreaks" by Rammer and Rupert (2019) used a deep learning approach to predict bark beetle outbreaks. Although the paper does not provide a code repository, it might give some insights into how to design a deep learning pipeline for vegetation science.

The paper "Using the U-Net convolutional network to map forest types and disturbance in the Atlantic rainforest with very high resolution images" by Wagner et al. (2019) used a deep learning model called U-Net to map forest types and disturbances. The authors implemented their model using Keras, a popular deep learning library in Python. Although the paper does not provide a code repository, the authors have published their code on GitHub for a related project (<https://github.com/rgeorgi/UNet-Lesion-Segmentation>). This code might be helpful as a starting point for implementing a deep learning pipeline for vegetation science.

The paper "Road extraction by deep residual U-Net" by Zhang et al. (2018) used a deep learning model called Residual U-Net to extract roads from remote sensing images. The authors implemented their model using TensorFlow, another popular deep learning library in Python. Although the paper does not provide a code repository, the authors have published their code on GitHub (<https://github.com/zhangzhen15/Residual-UNet>). This code might be helpful for implementing a deep learning pipeline for vegetation science using TensorFlow.

Finally, TensorFlow itself provides a comprehensive guide on how to build a deep learning pipeline using their library (<https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials>). This guide might be helpful for those who are new to deep learning and TensorFlow.

In summary, while there is no specific code repository provided in the context for the deep learning pipeline for vegetation science, there are some related resources that might be helpful for implementing a deep learning pipeline for vegetation science using Keras, TensorFlow, or other deep learning libraries.
