The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include rotation, flipping, adding Gaussian noise, contrast enhancement, sharpening of images, zoom range, and affine transformations. These techniques were used to augment the images of different bird species to counter overfitting and manage data imbalance. Each species' images were augmented ten times, including the original bird images. Specifically, rotation by 45 degrees, horizontal and vertical flipping, adding Gaussian noise, adjusting contrast, sharpening images, zooming within the range of 0.7 to 1.3, and applying affine transformations were used for data augmentation. These techniques help to increase the size of the dataset, improve the model's performance by providing more variations of the data, and prevent overfitting by reducing the likelihood of the model memorizing the training data.
