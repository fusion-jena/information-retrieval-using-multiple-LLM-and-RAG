The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of a validation set and a custom LeNet-5 network. The LeNet-5 network is a type of convolutional neural network (CNN) that is commonly used for image classification tasks. In this case, the network was customized for cactus recognition. The performance of the model was monitored by evaluating the training and validation accuracy and loss at the end of each epoch.

The training and validation sets were created by dividing the available data into two subsets, one for training the model and the other for evaluating its performance. The training set was used to adjust the model's weights and biases, while the validation set was used to monitor the model's performance and prevent overfitting.

The model's performance was evaluated by calculating the accuracy and loss for both the training and validation sets. Accuracy is a measure of the proportion of correct predictions, while loss is a measure of the difference between the predicted and actual values. By monitoring the training and validation accuracy and loss, it was possible to determine how well the model was learning and whether it was overfitting to the training data.

Additionally, data augmentation was used to improve the model's accuracy. Data augmentation is a technique that involves creating new training examples by applying various transformations to the existing data. In this case, the data was augmented by resizing the patches to 32 Ã— 32 and normalizing them, as well as flipping them vertically or horizontally with a probability of 0.5. This helped to increase the size of the training set and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

The learning rate, number of epochs, and batch size were set to 0.01, 150, and 2500, respectively. The learning rate is a hyperparameter that controls the size of the steps taken during gradient descent, while the number of epochs determines the number of times the model sees the entire training set. The batch size is the number of training examples used in each iteration of gradient descent.

The Adam optimizer was used to adjust the learning rate automatically during training. The Adam optimizer is a variant of stochastic gradient optimization that adjusts the learning rate based on the moving averages of the gradients and squared gradients. This helps to improve the model's convergence and reduce the need for manual tuning of the learning rate.

In summary, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of a validation set, a custom LeNet-5 network, and data augmentation. The training and validation accuracy and loss were monitored at the end of each epoch, and the learning rate was adjusted automatically using the Adam optimizer. This helped to improve the model's ability to learn and generalize to new data.
