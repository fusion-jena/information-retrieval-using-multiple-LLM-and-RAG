The provided context discusses the use of a specific dataset for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect whales in aerial images. However, it does not mention any of the standard datasets commonly used in deep learning pipelines, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.

MNIST is a dataset of handwritten digits that is widely used as a benchmark for image classification tasks. It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each of which is a 28x28 grayscale image of a digit from 0 to 9.

CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 are datasets of natural images that are commonly used for object recognition tasks. CIFAR-10 contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. CIFAR-100 is similar, but it has 100 classes, each containing 600 images.

ImageNet is a large-scale dataset of natural images that is used for object detection, image classification, and other tasks. It contains over 14 million images, each of which is labeled with one or more object categories. The dataset is divided into 1,000 categories, with 1,281,167 training images, 50,000 validation images, and 100,000 test images.

These datasets are widely used in the deep learning community because they provide a standard set of images and labels that can be used to compare different models and techniques. They are also relatively large, which allows deep learning models to learn a wide variety of features and patterns.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention any of the standard datasets used in deep learning pipelines, MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet are commonly used datasets for image classification, object recognition, and other tasks.
