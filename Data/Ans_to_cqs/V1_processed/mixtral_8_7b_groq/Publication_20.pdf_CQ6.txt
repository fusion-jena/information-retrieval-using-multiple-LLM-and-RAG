The provided context discusses the training of a deep learning model for fish species identification using a GoogLeNet architecture, but it does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps applied to the images before training. However, based on common practices in deep learning for computer vision tasks, we can infer some possible preprocessing steps.

First, it is likely that the images were resized to a fixed dimension, as GoogLeNet expects a fixed-size input. This is a common preprocessing step in deep learning for image classification tasks.

Second, data augmentation techniques might have been applied to increase the size of the training dataset and reduce overfitting. Data augmentation techniques include random cropping, rotation, flipping, and color jittering. These techniques create new training examples by applying random transformations to the original images.

Third, the images might have been normalized to have zero mean and unit variance. Normalization is a common preprocessing step in deep learning for image classification tasks, as it can improve the convergence of the training algorithm.

Fourth, the images might have been converted to a fixed-point representation, such as uint8, to reduce memory usage and improve training speed.

Finally, the images might have been cleaned by removing unwanted artifacts or noise.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps applied to the images, it is likely that the images were resized, augmented, normalized, and converted to a fixed-point representation before training. Additionally, the images might have been cleaned to remove unwanted artifacts or noise.
