The deep learning model used in the described pipeline is a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), which is a type of artificial neural network (ANN). The MLP is also referred to as a multilayer feedforward network, and it is the simplest type of deep learning model that can be used for supervised learning tasks.

The MLP used in this pipeline contains at least three layers: an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The input layer receives the features extracted from the training set, which includes the land use type, soil, topography, elevation, slope, aspect, distance to settlements, distance to roads, distance to rivers, and the four neighborhood grid units. These features are then processed by the hidden layer(s) using a non-linear activation function, such as the sigmoid function, tanh function, or ReLU function. The output layer then produces the probability maps needed for the simulation model.

The MLP has full connections between the layers, meaning that each neuron in one layer is connected to every neuron in the next layer. This allows the model to learn complex spatiotemporal dependencies and fit the drivers and mechanisms of the land use change and cover (LUCC).

The MLP is used in this pipeline to derive probability maps for water and settlements, which are constraint factors in the simulation model. These constraint factors can be determined by manual interpretation, and thus, no simulation is needed.

In summary, the deep learning model used in the described pipeline is a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), which is a type of artificial neural network (ANN). The MLP is used to fit the drivers and mechanisms of the LUCC, derive probability maps for water and settlements, and perform further LU simulations.
