The deep learning pipeline can handle various data formats, including image, audio, video, and CSV files. However, the specific data format used depends on the problem being addressed and the type of deep learning model employed.

In the context of landslide susceptibility modeling (LSM), the study by Agboola et al. (2024) mentioned using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN). These models are primarily designed for image data, making them suitable for analyzing remote sensing images in LSM. Remote sensing images can be provided as raster data in various formats, such as GeoTIFF, JPEG, or PNG.

For other machine learning models used in LSM, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and XGBoost, the data format is typically tabular, with features represented as columns and instances as rows. These models can handle CSV files or other tabular formats like Excel or text files.

The features used in LSM can include soil, lithology, land cover, distance to streams, distance to roads, and other factors. These features can be encoded as numerical or categorical variables in the tabular data format. For instance, lithology can be represented as categorical variables with different gneiss, schist, and granite types. Similarly, land cover can be represented as categorical variables with forest, grassland, wetland, cropland, barrenland, urban, and water body classes.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline can handle various data formats, including image, audio, video, and CSV files. In the context of LSM, remote sensing images are typically provided as raster data, while other machine learning models use tabular data formats like CSV. The features used in LSM can be encoded as numerical or categorical variables in the tabular data format.
