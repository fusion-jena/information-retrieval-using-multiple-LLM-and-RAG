The provided context does not give specific information about the type of data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of a pre-trained detector model on images and the embedding of the obtained crops into a lower-dimensional space. These steps suggest the use of object detection as a data annotation technique.

Object detection is a computer vision task that involves locating and identifying objects in an image or video. This is typically done by drawing bounding boxes around the objects and classifying them into specific categories.

In addition to object detection, other data annotation techniques that are commonly used in deep learning pipelines include:

* **Semantic segmentation**: This is a pixel-level classification task where each pixel in an image is assigned a class label. It is often used for image segmentation, where the goal is to separate the foreground objects from the background.
* **Instance segmentation**: This is a combination of object detection and semantic segmentation, where each instance of an object is segmented and classified.
* **Bounding box annotation**: This is the process of drawing bounding boxes around objects in an image or video. It is often used for object detection and tracking.
* **Key point annotation**: This is the process of identifying and locating key points or landmarks on objects in an image or video. It is often used for pose estimation and tracking.

It is important to note that the choice of data annotation technique will depend on the specific task and the data available. In the case of the study described in the provided context, it appears that object detection was used as the data annotation technique. However, the context does not provide enough information to confirm this.
