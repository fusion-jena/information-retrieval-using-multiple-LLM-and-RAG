The provided context discusses the deep learning techniques used in a model, including the use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), ResNet-50, InceptionV3, and InceptionResNetV2. However, it does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the pipeline.

Data annotation is a crucial step in the development of deep learning models, especially for computer vision tasks. Common annotation techniques include:

1. Image-level annotation: This is the simplest form of annotation where an image is labeled as a whole, indicating the presence or absence of a particular object or class.
2. Bounding box annotation: In this technique, a bounding box is drawn around the object of interest in an image, providing a rough localization of the object.
3. Semantic segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image with a class, resulting in a pixel-wise classification of the image.
4. Instance segmentation: This is a more advanced form of segmentation where each instance of an object is segmented and distinguished from other instances of the same object in the image.

Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the dataset used in the study consists of images of okra leaves, with each image being labeled as either healthy or diseased (image-level annotation). However, the context does not provide information on more advanced annotation techniques such as bounding box, semantic, or instance segmentation.

Therefore, the answer to the query is:

 The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that image-level annotation (labeling images as healthy or diseased) was used based on the description of the dataset. Further details on other annotation techniques such as bounding box, semantic, or instance segmentation are not provided in the context.
