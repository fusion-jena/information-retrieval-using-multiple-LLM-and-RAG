The provided context does not contain information about data bias reduction techniques in the context of deep learning or any preprocessing techniques for that matter. However, I can provide some general techniques that are used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline.

One common technique is stratified sampling or stratified splitting. Stratified sampling is a method of sampling that guarantees that the sample is representative of the population with respect to certain characteristics. For example, if we have a dataset of images of cats and dogs, and we want to split the dataset into training and testing sets, we can use stratified splitting to ensure that both sets have the same proportion of cat and dog images. This way, we can avoid biasing our model towards one class.

Another technique is oversampling or undersampling. Oversampling is a technique where we increase the number of samples from a minority class to balance the dataset. Undersampling is a technique where we decrease the number of samples from the majority class to balance the dataset. Both techniques can help reduce bias towards the majority class. However, oversampling can lead to overfitting, while undersampling can lead to loss of information.

Diverse data collection is another technique to reduce bias. By collecting data from various sources, we can ensure that our dataset is representative of the population. This can help reduce bias towards a particular group or class.

In addition to these techniques, there are other preprocessing techniques that can help reduce bias in deep learning models. Data normalization, for example, can help ensure that all features have the same scale, which can prevent bias towards features with larger scales. Data augmentation can help increase the size of the dataset and create new samples that can help reduce bias towards certain classes or groups.

In summary, there are several techniques that can be used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. These include stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, diverse data collection, data normalization, and data augmentation. The choice of technique depends on the dataset and the specific problem at hand.
