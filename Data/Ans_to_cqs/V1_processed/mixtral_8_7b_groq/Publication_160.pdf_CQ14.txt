The hyperparameters of the model were optimized using a technique called grid search. Grid search is a systematic method for searching the best set of hyperparameters in a model. It involves specifying a range of possible values for each hyperparameter and then training the model with all possible combinations of these values. In this particular case, the hyperparameters that were optimized through grid search were the regularization parameter C and the solver algorithm. The regularization parameter C was given a range of values from 10^-4 to 100, and the solver algorithm was given three possible values: sag, saga, and lbfgs.

The performance of the model was evaluated based on the accuracy of the classification, which was required to be between 70% and 80%. The classes for which the accuracy was evaluated included "Sand", "Eunicella singularis", "Filamentous green algae", "Filamentous red algae", "Flabellia petiolata", "Haliclona sp.", "Halimeda tuna", "Palmophyllum crassum", "Encrusting Peyssonnelia sp.", "Pentapora fascialis", "Phorbas tenacior", and "Pleraplysilla spinifera".

The results of the grid search were then analyzed using reliability diagrams, which plot the confidence of the model against the accuracy. These diagrams were plotted for the baseline ResNet152, the best ResNet18, and the ensemble network with and without LR. The red line in these diagrams represents a theoretical, perfect calibration, where the confidence of the model is equal to the accuracy.

The results of the grid search showed that the best ResNet18 model was obtained with a patch size of 224 x 224 pixels, which gave the highest micro-F1 score of 65.94 on the test set. This patch size included enough contextual noise to regularize overfitting and enabled better generalization. The ensemble network, which was based on the four tested patch sizes and followed the feature extraction scheme of local-SPP, further improved the classification of the model.

In conclusion, the hyperparameters of the model were optimized using grid search, which involved specifying a range of possible values for the regularization parameter C and the solver algorithm. The performance of the model was evaluated based on the accuracy of the classification, which was required to be between 70% and 80%. The results of the grid search showed that the best ResNet18 model was obtained with a patch size of 224 x 224 pixels, which gave the highest micro-F1 score of 65.94 on the test set.
