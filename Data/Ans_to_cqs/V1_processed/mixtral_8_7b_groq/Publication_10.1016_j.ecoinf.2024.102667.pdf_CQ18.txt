Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context focuses on the use of the Greenness Season Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GSNNDVI) to assess vegetation changes in China due to human activities and climate change.

However, in general, monitoring model performance during training is crucial to ensure that the model is learning effectively and to detect any issues early on. There are several strategies commonly used to monitor model performance during training, such as:

1. Validation set: Splitting the dataset into a training set and a validation set. The model is trained on the training set, and its performance is evaluated on the validation set after each epoch. This helps to identify if the model is overfitting or underfitting.
2. Learning curve: Plotting the model's performance on the training and validation sets against the number of training examples. This helps to identify if the model needs more data or if it is overfitting.
3. Regularization: Using techniques such as L1 and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting. These techniques add a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages the model from learning overly complex patterns in the training data.
4. Early stopping: Stopping the training process early if the model's performance on the validation set starts to degrade. This helps to prevent overfitting.
5. Model selection: Comparing the performance of different models on the validation set to select the best one.

Without more specific information, it is difficult to say which of these strategies, if any, were used to monitor the model performance during training in the context provided.
