The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline described in the given context is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is inferred from the use of the ResNet50 architecture, which is a well-known CNN model. ResNet50 is a residual network that was introduced in the paper "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition" by He et al. (2016). The use of CNNs for image classification tasks is common in the field of deep learning, and they have been particularly successful in tasks related to computer vision. CNNs are designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from images, which makes them well-suited for tasks such as object detection and image recognition. The ResNet50 model, in particular, has been used in various applications, including the classification of camera trap images for ecological studies. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a CNN, specifically the ResNet50 architecture.
