The provided context does not contain information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The focus of the papers is on the development and evaluation of deep learning models for image classification tasks, rather than the deployment of those models on a specific cloud platform.

The first paper by LeCun, Bengio, and Hinton (2015) provides a comprehensive overview of deep learning and its applications, but it does not mention any specific cloud platform for deployment. Similarly, the second paper by Mukhoti et al. (2020) introduces a new method for calibrating deep neural networks using focal loss, but it does not provide information on deployment.

The third paper by Noguerales et al. (2021) uses deep learning models for classifying soil microarthropods based on metabarcoding data, but again, there is no information on the deployment platform.

In summary, the provided context does not contain information about the specific cloud platform used for deploying the deep learning models.
