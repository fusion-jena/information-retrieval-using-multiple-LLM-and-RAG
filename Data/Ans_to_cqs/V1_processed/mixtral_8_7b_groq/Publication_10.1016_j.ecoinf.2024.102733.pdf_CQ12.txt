The deep learning model employed in the pipeline is a Diffusion model. This is evident from the context provided, which mentions that "Diffusion models, a type of generative deep learning model, have demonstrated potential across a range of computer vision tasks...". Although the text focuses more on the use of an MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) for classification after extracting features from an Autoencoder model, the initial feature extraction is performed using a Diffusion model. This is also supported by the statement that suggests "features learned from raw trajectories (especially through unsupervised pre-training) can be preferable to hand-crafted features", implying the use of a generative model for learning these features.
