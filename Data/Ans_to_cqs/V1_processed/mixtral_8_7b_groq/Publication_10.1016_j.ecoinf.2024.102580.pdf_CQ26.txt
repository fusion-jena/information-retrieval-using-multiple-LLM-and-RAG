The provided context discusses the use of deep learning for vegetation mapping and monitoring natural ecosystems, but it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the importance of ground-truth datasets for training deep learning models, which can be a source of data bias.

One common technique to address data bias during preprocessing is through diverse data collection. This involves gathering a dataset that is representative of the variation present in the target population. For example, when creating a ground-truth dataset for vegetation mapping, it would be important to include images of different vegetation types, ages, and densities, as well as different lighting and weather conditions.

Another technique is stratified splitting, which involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on certain characteristics, such as vegetation type, and then randomly sampling from each subgroup to create the training, validation, and test sets. This ensures that each set is representative of the variation present in the target population.

Additionally, oversampling and undersampling can be used to address data bias. Oversampling involves increasing the number of examples from underrepresented classes in the dataset, while undersampling involves decreasing the number of examples from overrepresented classes. This can help to balance the dataset and prevent the model from being biased towards the overrepresented classes.

The context also mentions the use of open-source user frameworks for deep learning, such as those provided by Christin et al., 2019; Paszke et al., 2019; Perry et al., 2022, which may have built-in functions for addressing data bias during preprocessing.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, it does mention the importance of ground-truth datasets and the use of open-source user frameworks, which can be used to implement techniques such as diverse data collection, stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling.
