The provided context does not contain information about the specific platform or service (such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform) that was used to deploy the deep learning model. The text focuses on the details of the target models used (ResNet50 and DenseNet121), the dataset distribution, and the optimization algorithms' hyperparameters for both overfitting and no-overfitting scenarios. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
