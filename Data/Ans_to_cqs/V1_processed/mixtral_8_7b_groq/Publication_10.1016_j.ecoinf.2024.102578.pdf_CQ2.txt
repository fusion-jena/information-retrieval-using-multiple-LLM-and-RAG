Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline in this study uses image data formats. The research focuses on image classification for Arctic wildlife monitoring using time-lapse camera trap images. 

The dataset is composed of images, specifically those taken by camera traps in two locations: Finnmark and Yamal. These images are used to train a deep learning model for classifying image quality into two categories: "Bad" and "Good". 

The training dataset was created by randomly selecting images from each site, camera, and year, resulting in approximately 15,000 images of Bad quality and 57,000 images of Good quality for each location. These images were then reexamined by experts to ensure accurate classifications. 

The study also mentions the use of ResNet-50, a deep residual network developed for image recognition tasks, and MegaDetector, a deep learning model for object detection in camera trap images. Both of these models are designed to work with image data formats.

Therefore, the deep learning pipeline in this study primarily uses image data formats. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats in the provided context.
