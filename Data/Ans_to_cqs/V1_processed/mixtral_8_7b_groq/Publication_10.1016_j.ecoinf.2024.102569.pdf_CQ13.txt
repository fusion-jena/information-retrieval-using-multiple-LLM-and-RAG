Based on the provided context, the question seems to be asking about hyperparameters in the context of a deep learning model, but the text given does not describe any deep learning model or its associated hyperparameters. Instead, it discusses a penalized loss function with an L1 penalty and a tuning parameter ϕ, as well as a method for selecting the tuning parameters using root trimmed mean squared prediction error (RTMSPE) and a constant tuning parameter τ.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.


 I do not have enough information to determine the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
