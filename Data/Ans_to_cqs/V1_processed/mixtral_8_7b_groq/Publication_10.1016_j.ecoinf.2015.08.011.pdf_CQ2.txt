The provided context does not discuss the specific data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does describe the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in the context of environmental science and epidemiology. The ANNs are used to model and analyze data, but the original format of the data is not specified.

In general, deep learning pipelines can handle various types of data formats such as images, audio, video, and CSV files. The choice of data format depends on the specific problem and the type of data available. For instance, image data is typically used in computer vision tasks, while time-series data (e.g., CSV files) is often used in signal processing and natural language processing tasks.

In the context of the provided articles, it can be inferred that the data formats used are likely to be time-series or spatial data, given the focus on environmental science and epidemiology. For example, in the study by Chuang et al. (2012), cross-correlation map analyses are performed on mosquito abundance patterns, which suggests the use of time-series data. Similarly, in the study by Park et al. (2003), artificial neural networks are applied for patterning and predicting aquatic insect species richness in running waters, which suggests the use of spatial data.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that time-series or spatial data are likely to be used based on the focus of the studies.
