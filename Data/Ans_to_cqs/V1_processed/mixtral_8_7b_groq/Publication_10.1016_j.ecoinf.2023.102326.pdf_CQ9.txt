Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The text describes the use of audio data from the SALVE study, recorded in urban forests in Bochum, Germany. However, it does not mention where or how the data from this study is shared or made available for others to access. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query. If the data repository is specified in other parts of the text or in related publications, it would be necessary to consult those sources for the answer.
