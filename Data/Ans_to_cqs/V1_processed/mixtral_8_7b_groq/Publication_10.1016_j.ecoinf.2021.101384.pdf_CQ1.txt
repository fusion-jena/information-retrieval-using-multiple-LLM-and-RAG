The provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of two different data sources for the fishing activity and pressure analysis: Fishing Activity and Pressure from Vessel Tracking Data (FAP-VTI) and Fishing Activity and Pressure from Global Fishing Watch data (FAP-GFW).

The FAP-VTI service accepts user-provided vessel tracking data in CSV format, which suggests that this data is collected through some form of tracking device or system on the vessels. The context does not provide information on the specific methods used for collecting this data. However, it can be inferred that tracking devices or systems are used to collect the location and movement data of the vessels.

The FAP-GFW service, on the other hand, uses a free-to-use dataset from Global Fishing Watch, which includes vessel data aggregated at 0.01 resolution with fishing activity cells already classified through a machine learning model. The Global Fishing Watch dataset covers the period from 2012 to 2016 and is available for scientific purposes. The context does not provide information on the specific methods used for collecting this data. However, it can be inferred that the data is collected through a combination of tracking devices or systems on the vessels and satellite or aerial surveillance.

In addition to the two data sources mentioned in the context, there are various other methods for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. Surveys, both online and offline, can be used to collect data on various phenomena. Sensors, such as temperature sensors, humidity sensors, and pressure sensors, can be used to collect data on physical phenomena. Public datasets, such as government databases, open data repositories, and scientific publications, can also be used as sources of raw data.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that vessel tracking devices or systems and publicly available datasets are used for the fishing activity and pressure analysis. Additionally, surveys, sensors, and public datasets can be used as sources of raw data in a deep learning pipeline.
