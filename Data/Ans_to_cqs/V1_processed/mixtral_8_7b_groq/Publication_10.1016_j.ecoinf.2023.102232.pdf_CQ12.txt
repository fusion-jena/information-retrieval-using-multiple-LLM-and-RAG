The provided context does not mention the use of any deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or Transformers. The computations were carried out using a high-performance computing center with Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) ProLiant DL560 Gen10 nodes, each equipped with Intel Xeon Gold 5118 processors and 512 GB of RAM. The calculations were managed by the Python 3.6.8 package Ray, version 1.9.2.

The study involves a physiologically-based model for the Drosophila suzukii case study, which includes a system of differential equations describing the development of egg, larva, and adult stages. The model also includes development rate functions, mortality rate functions, and fertility rate functions. The model parameters were estimated using a least-squares (LS) algorithm and a genetic algorithm for optimization.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the study does not involve the use of any deep learning models.
