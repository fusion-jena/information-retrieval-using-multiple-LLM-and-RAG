The raw data used in the study mentioned in the context is obtained through two methods: surveys and commercial fishing. The survey data covers a spatial range between 29S and 39S for eleven months, while the commercial data covers a wider spatial range between 33S and 42S but was concentrated in two months. 

The survey data includes biological sampling, which is considered for the study, and its sampling design can be found in Tascheri et al. (2001). On the other hand, the commercial fishing data was obtained from commercial vessels and its sampling design can be found in Fischer (1981). 

Additionally, the context mentions that the commercial data includes 101 records, with the mean minimum depth being 1.8. However, the longitude was not an important predictor in the commercial fishing data, appearing as a root only 24 times. In contrast, the month was less important in the survey data, as it had zero occurrences as a root and only formed a split 516 times. 

It is worth noting that the study does not mention any public datasets being used in the study. Also, the data used in the study is confidential, as stated in the data availability section. 

In summary, the raw data used in the study is collected through two methods: surveys and commercial fishing. The survey data includes biological sampling and covers a wider spatial range but for a shorter period, while the commercial fishing data covers a wider spatial range but for a shorter period and is obtained from commercial vessels. Additionally, the study does not mention any public datasets being used and the data used is confidential.
