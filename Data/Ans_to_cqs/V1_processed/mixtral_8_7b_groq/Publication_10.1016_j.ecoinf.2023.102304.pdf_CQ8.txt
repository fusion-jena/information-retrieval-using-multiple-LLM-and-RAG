I am unable to locate the code repository of the deep learning pipeline in the provided context. The context consists of various scientific research articles and datasets, but none of them mention or provide a code repository for a deep learning pipeline. The articles focus on topics such as geospatial analysis, aridity index, vegetation cover, Landsat digital analysis, and forest disturbance. While they discuss methods and techniques, none of them explicitly provide a code repository. Therefore, I would recommend looking elsewhere for the code repository of the deep learning pipeline.
