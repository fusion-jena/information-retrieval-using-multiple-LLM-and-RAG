The provided context does not contain information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The text focuses on the process of creating and training the model, including the use of a pre-trained VGGnet model, fine-tuning on the Benthoz15 dataset, and the use of a subset of this dataset for training a classifier. It also describes the pre-processing steps applied to the images in the dataset. However, it does not mention any details about the deployment of the model on a specific cloud platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
