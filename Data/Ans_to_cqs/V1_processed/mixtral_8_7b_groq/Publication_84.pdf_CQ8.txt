Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The articles and abstracts mentioned in the context focus on the application of remote sensing, big data, and deep learning techniques to understand the invasion of Spartina alterniflora in cloudy coastal zones, but they do not mention where the code for the deep learning pipeline is available. It is possible that the code is not publicly available or that it was not shared in the context provided. If you are interested in the code, I would recommend reaching out to the authors of the articles for more information.
