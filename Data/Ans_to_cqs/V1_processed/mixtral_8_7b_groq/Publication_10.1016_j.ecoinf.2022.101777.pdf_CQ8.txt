Based on the provided context, there is no information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text focuses on the use of the Curve Number (CN) method to quantify infiltration capacity in different sub-basins and the impact of changing land use from agriculture to forestry on runoff. It also includes figures and tables related to the observed and simulated data for different events. However, there is no mention of the code repository or the deep learning pipeline used in the study. Therefore, I am unable to provide the location of the code repository.
