The passage does not provide explicit information on the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) is widely adopted for recording the oceans' soundscape over larger temporal and spatial scales. PAM involves the use of sensors or hydrophones to record underwater sounds. These sensors can be deployed on various platforms such as moorings, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), or buoys. The data collected can include sounds from marine animals, anthropogenic sources, and geophysical sounds. Additionally, the authors mention the use of public datasets in their research, as they used a trained CNN model that was available for download. Therefore, it can be inferred that raw data in this deep learning pipeline is collected using PAM sensors and possibly from public datasets.
