Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling in the deep learning pipeline. However, the text does discuss techniques used to address a specific type of bias in species distribution modeling (SDM) called sampling bias.

In SDM, sampling bias occurs when the distribution of the presence sites of a species is not representative of the true distribution of the species in the environment. To address this issue, Phillips et al. (2009) proposed a method that involves transforming the model input data using four approaches. These approaches can be categorized based on two criteria: the dataset concerned with the transformation (presence sites or background sites) and the implementation spaces of the transformation (geographical or environmental space).

When the presence dataset is considered, the authors aim at modifying its distribution to tend toward a uniform distribution. This is achieved by uniformly randomly selecting presence sites (as done with the dataset "pres\_UNB") and obtaining the background set via a uniform random selection. The implementation space of such an approach can be either the geographical space or environmental feature space.

When the background set is considered, it is built according to a selection bias that reflects the same sampling bias. This approach is used to create a more balanced dataset and reduce the impact of sampling bias on the SDM.

The provided context also mentions that the correction methods used in the study were parameterized using knowledge from the literature and experts of the ecology of the An. darlingi species. The chosen parameterization appeared to be the most appropriate by achieving a good compromise.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly mention data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling, it does discuss techniques used to address sampling bias in SDM. These techniques involve transforming the model input data based on the presence and background datasets and the implementation spaces of the transformation.
