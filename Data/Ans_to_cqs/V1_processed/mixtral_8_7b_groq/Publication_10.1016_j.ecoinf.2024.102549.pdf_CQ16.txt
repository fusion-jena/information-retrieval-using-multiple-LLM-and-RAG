The criteria used to determine when training is complete for the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the training process involves monitoring the performance of the model over 500 epochs, with the learning rate being halved every 20 rounds to optimize performance. This adaptive learning rate strategy suggests that the training process might be using a form of early stopping, where the training is halted if the model's performance on a validation set stops improving, even before the 500 epochs are completed.

Moreover, the incorporation of a dropout function between the fully connected layers indicates a regularization strategy to prevent overfitting. This further supports the possibility of early stopping, as regularization techniques often accompany this method to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.

However, it is important to note that the context does not explicitly confirm the use of early stopping or any other specific criterion for determining the completion of training.
