Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text describes the methods and implementation details of the pipeline, but it does not give a link to the code repository on GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other platform. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
