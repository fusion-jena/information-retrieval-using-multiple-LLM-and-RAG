Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context focuses on the use of the MWST-learned network for the final clustering of each group of variables and the creation of a hierarchical clustering network that summarizes information on the coral reef community from the measured variables across taxa.

In general, when training a deep learning model, it is common to split the dataset into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune the model and select the best hyperparameters, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance.

The criteria used to split the data can vary depending on the specific problem and dataset. Some common methods include random sampling, stratified sampling, and time-series splitting. Random sampling involves randomly selecting a certain percentage of the data for each subset. Stratified sampling involves dividing the data into strata based on certain characteristics (e.g., class labels) and then randomly selecting a certain percentage of the data from each stratum for each subset. Time-series splitting involves splitting the data based on time, using the earliest data for training, the next portion for validation, and the most recent data for testing.

Without more specific information from the context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query. However, it is important to note that proper data splitting is crucial for the successful training and evaluation of deep learning models.
