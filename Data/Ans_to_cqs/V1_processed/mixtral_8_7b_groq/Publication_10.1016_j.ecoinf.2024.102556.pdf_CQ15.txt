The provided context does not explicitly mention any optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the implementation of a multiscale feature-extraction network (MSNet) to improve the feature extraction process in a target tracking system.

The MSNet is built using Res2Net modules and group convolution, which replaces the Feature Extraction Network (FEN) in the Deep SORT algorithm. This modification enhances the multiscale representation in the FEN, leading to a more detailed and intricate level of feature extraction.

The original residual network in MSNet constructs the FEN by stacking rule-based residual blocks to capture appearance information. However, due to the depth and structure of the network, it can only extract shallow features, making it challenging to extract deeper features of the target. To address the occlusion challenges in MOT (Multiple Object Tracking) scenarios, it is essential to introduce deeper networks. However, multiple downsampling stages in these deeper networks result in a lower resolution for the final feature map layer, which reduces the effectiveness of the information for small targets in the output feature.

The optimized network described in the context uses a combination of Conv+BatchNorm+SiLU integration module (CBS), Efficient Layer Aggregation Networks (ELAN), and Hybrid Convolutional (MPConv) layers. The ELAN layer is designed as an efficient aggregation network with a multi-stream structure to learn various features through different convolutional streams. The MPConv layer is branched into a CBS layer and a Maxpool layer, and features extracted from each layer are fused through the Concat operation. The aggregated feature pyramid structure facilitates the fusion of features extracted from each layer. The SPP pyramid structure is used in the header network for multiple inputs and transferring information from the bottom to the top. Finally, the RepConv structure is utilized to adjust the number of channels for different scaled features.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention any optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam, it does describe the implementation of a multiscale feature-extraction network (MSNet) using Res2Net modules and group convolution to replace the FEN in the Deep SORT algorithm. The MSNet is designed to extract deeper features of the target, and it uses a combination of Conv+BatchNorm+SiLU integration module (CBS), Efficient Layer Aggregation Networks (ELAN), and Hybrid Convolutional (MPConv) layers to achieve a more intricate and detailed level of feature extraction.
