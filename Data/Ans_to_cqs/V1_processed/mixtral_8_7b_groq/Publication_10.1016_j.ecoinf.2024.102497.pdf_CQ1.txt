The raw data used in the deep learning pipeline for water environment analysis is acquired from GF-6 (WFV) remote sensing data, as stated in the context. The China Centre for Resources Satellite Data and Application (<http://www.cresda.com/CN/>) is the source of this data. Remote sensing technology is used to collect this data, which involves the use of sensors on satellites to capture images and other information from the Earth's surface.

Before using the data in the deep learning pipeline, it undergoes pre-processing, which includes radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction, geometric correction, and image cropping. These steps are necessary to ensure the accuracy and quality of the data.

It is important to note that the GF-6 remote sensing data includes newly added violet and red-edge2 bands, which hold promise to enhance the accuracy of nearshore bathymetry retrieval and yield comprehensive water environment insights. Water depth, which can be derived from the processed data, is an effective parameter for evaluating water pollution conditions in the absence of water quality data. It also aids in monitoring underwater fish and marine environments.

There is no mention of any surveys or public datasets being used as sources of raw data in this particular deep learning pipeline. Therefore, the primary method of data collection appears to be remote sensing using satellites.
