The provided context does not contain information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model for coastal bathymetry estimation from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The study by Najar et al. (2022) compares deep learning and physics-based approaches for coastal bathymetry estimation, but it does not mention the platform used for deep learning model deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
