The deep learning model was built using Darknet, which is a neural network framework written in C and CUDA. Darknet is the default framework for the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection system, and it is known for its speed and efficiency in detecting objects within images. The model was trained and tested in a Google Colab notebook, which provides a free cloud-based platform for running Python code, including deep learning models. The specific version of Darknet used in this study is not explicitly mentioned, but it is likely that it is the most recent version (YOLOv4) based on the references cited in the text.

It is worth noting that Darknet is not as popular as other deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, but it has been gaining attention in the computer vision community due to its performance in object detection tasks. Darknet is also open-source and allows users to customize and train their own models, making it a flexible option for researchers and developers.

In summary, the deep learning model was built using Darknet, a neural network framework optimized for object detection tasks. The model was trained and tested in a Google Colab notebook, a free cloud-based platform for running Python code.
