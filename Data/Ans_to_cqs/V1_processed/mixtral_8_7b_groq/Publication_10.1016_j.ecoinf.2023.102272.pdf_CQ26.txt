Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that the data was randomly partitioned into training, validation, and testing sets using the R package dismo. While random partitioning can help to reduce bias in some cases, it may not be sufficient when dealing with imbalanced or biased data.

In the context of machine learning and deep learning, techniques such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection are commonly used to address data bias during preprocessing.

Stratified sampling is a method of sampling that ensures each stratum or subgroup of the population is proportionally represented in the sample. This can help to ensure that the training, validation, and testing sets are representative of the overall population and reduce bias.

Oversampling is a technique used to increase the number of instances of the minority class in the dataset. This can help to prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class and improve its performance on the minority class.

Undersampling is a technique used to decrease the number of instances of the majority class in the dataset. This can help to prevent the model from being overwhelmed by the majority class and improve its performance on the minority class.

Diverse data collection involves gathering data from a variety of sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population in terms of demographics, geography, and other relevant factors. This can help to ensure that the model is not biased towards any particular subgroup and is able to generalize well to the overall population.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, it is mentioned that the data was randomly partitioned using the R package dismo. To address data bias, techniques such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection are commonly used during preprocessing in deep learning pipelines.
