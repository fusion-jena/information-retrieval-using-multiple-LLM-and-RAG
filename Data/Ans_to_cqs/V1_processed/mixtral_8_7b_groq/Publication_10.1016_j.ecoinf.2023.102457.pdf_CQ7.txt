The context provided does not give specific information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that contributions to larger data input for future training of deep learning models are being made. This suggests that some form of data splitting is likely taking place, as it is a common practice in machine learning to split data into separate sets for training, validation, and testing.

In general, data is typically split into three sets: a training set, a validation set, and a test set. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and make decisions during the model building process, and the test set is used to evaluate the model's performance.

The specific criteria used to split the data can vary depending on the use case and the amount of available data. For example, a common approach is to split the data into 60% training, 20% validation, and 20% testing sets. Another approach is to use k-fold cross-validation, where the data is split into k equal-sized subsets, and the model is trained and validated k times, with each subset used once as the validation set.

In the case of the pre-trained BirdNET model mentioned in the context, the data splitting criteria is not specified. The model was originally trained on a large dataset of bird audio recordings, but the specifics of how the data was split are not provided in the given context.

In summary, while the context does not provide specific information on the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it is likely that some form of data splitting is taking place. Common approaches include splitting the data into separate training, validation, and testing sets, or using k-fold cross-validation.
