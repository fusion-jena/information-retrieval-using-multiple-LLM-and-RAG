Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps applied after model training. However, it does mention the use of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as a termination condition for Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), which suggests that RMSE calculation is one of the steps. Additionally, it is mentioned that all analyses were performed using the Caret package in R, which provides various options for model evaluation and validation, including the calculation of different metrics and the generation of confusion matrices. Therefore, it can be inferred that metrics calculation and confusion matrix generation are likely to be among the postprocessing steps. As for saliency maps, there is no information in the context that suggests they were used in this study.

In general, postprocessing steps after model training can include various activities such as:

1. Model evaluation: This involves calculating different metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, RMSE, etc., to assess the performance of the model.
2. Confusion matrix generation: This is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model. It shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
3. Saliency map generation: This is a technique used in deep learning models to visualize the importance of each input feature towards the model's prediction. It can help in understanding which features the model is focusing on and can be useful for feature selection and interpretation.
4. Hyperparameter tuning: This involves adjusting the parameters of the model to improve its performance.
5. Model interpretation and explanation: This involves understanding how the model is making its predictions and explaining its decisions.

Therefore, while the context does not provide specific information about the postprocessing steps used in this study, it can be inferred that model evaluation and confusion matrix generation are likely to have been carried out. Additionally, given the use of the Caret package, it is possible that other postprocessing steps such as metrics calculation, hyperparameter tuning, and model interpretation may also have been performed. However, without further information, this remains a conjecture.
