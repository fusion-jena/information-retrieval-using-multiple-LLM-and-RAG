The text provided gives some insight into the methods used for collecting raw data in the context of weed datasets, which can be relevant for deep learning pipelines related to agriculture and computer vision.

The authors conducted a survey of weed datasets, searching in major databases such as Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and arXiv. They used the keywords "weed dataset", "weed database", "agriculture", "machine vision", and "computer vision". This approach suggests that one method for collecting raw data in this domain is to survey and compile existing datasets.

Furthermore, the authors collected a total of 451 records from the literature search. However, the text does not provide specific details about the types of sensors or survey methods used to gather the original data in these records. Therefore, while we know that a survey of existing datasets was conducted, the specific sensors or data collection methods for the individual records are not described.

The text does mention that the datasets were often captured under controlled indoor settings, specifically using potted plants. This suggests the use of controlled laboratory conditions and potentially specialized equipment for data collection. However, the specifics of this equipment are not provided.

In terms of the types of data collected, the text mentions that the metadata included in the dataset often consisted of information such as camera, date, and capture time. Additionally, the data itself was often in the form of RGB (Red Green Blue) images, which is typical for computer vision tasks. Some records also included multimodal data, such as RGB-D (Red Green Blue-Depth) or MSI (Multispectral Imaging) data.

In conclusion, while the text provides some information about the methods used for collecting raw data in weed datasets, it does not give detailed descriptions of the specific sensors or survey methods used. The data collection methods mentioned include surveys of existing datasets, controlled laboratory conditions, and various types of imaging data. However, more specific information would be needed to fully answer the query.
