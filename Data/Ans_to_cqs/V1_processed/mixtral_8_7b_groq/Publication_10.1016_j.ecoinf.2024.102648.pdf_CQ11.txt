Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context includes references to an article titled "Ecological Informatics 81(2024)1026488" by S.K. Sain et al., which discusses the use of deep learning methods for predicting Cotton Leaf Curl Disease (CLCuD) in upland cotton. The article includes figures illustrating major deep learning methods and the spread of CLCuD in different locations. However, there is no information about the data repository used for this research.

 Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. It is recommended to contact the authors of the article or look for additional information in the published paper to find out more about the data repository used.
