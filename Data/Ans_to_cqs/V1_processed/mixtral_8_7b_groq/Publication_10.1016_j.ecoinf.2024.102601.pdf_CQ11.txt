I regret to inform you that the provided pieces of context do not include the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the related research of optimizing data structures in machine learning models for World Settlement Monitoring (WSM) and the use of RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV to refine the performance of the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. Therefore, I'm unable to provide the requested information.
