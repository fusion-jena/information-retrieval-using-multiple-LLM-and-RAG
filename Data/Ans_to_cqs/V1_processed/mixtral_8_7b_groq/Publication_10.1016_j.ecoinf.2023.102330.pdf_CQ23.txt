Based on the information provided, it is not explicitly stated which measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model used for the detection of Northern Bobwhite covey calls. However, there are some clues in the text that suggest that some steps were taken to ensure the model's performance.

Firstly, the study used data collected on a population of Northern Bobwhite on Di-Lane Plantation WMA, Burke County, Georgia during autumn 2016-2018 (Nolan et al., 2022). While the specific details of the dataset are not provided, it can be inferred that the dataset used to train the model is not limited to a single year, which could help improve the model's generalizability.

Secondly, the study used a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a score detection threshold of 0.95 to analyze the data (Nolan et al., 2022). The use of a threshold suggests that the researchers took steps to filter out false positives, which could improve the model's accuracy.

Finally, the study used distance sampling to improve estimates of national population sizes for common and widespread breeding birds in the UK (Buckland et al., 2019). While this study did not use the same deep learning model as Nolan et al. (2022), it does demonstrate the researchers' expertise in using statistical methods to improve the accuracy of population estimates. It is possible that they applied similar methods to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.

In summary, while the information provided does not explicitly state which measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, there are some clues that suggest that the researchers took steps to improve the model's performance, such as using data from multiple years, filtering out false positives, and applying statistical methods to improve accuracy. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
