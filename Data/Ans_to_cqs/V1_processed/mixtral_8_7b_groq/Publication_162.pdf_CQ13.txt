Unfortunately, the provided context does not contain specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text describes the architecture of a modified Mask R-CNN model, called D-Mask R-CNN, which is used for detecting and segmenting deer instances in RGB-D data. It also mentions that they trained a standard deep learning classifier (ResNet-50 pre-trained on ImageNet) on cropped bounding box images of detected moths. However, the details of the training process, including hyperparameters, are not provided. Therefore, I cannot give a specific answer to this query.
