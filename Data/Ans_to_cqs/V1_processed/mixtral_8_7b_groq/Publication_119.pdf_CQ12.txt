The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a U-Net model with a ResNet-50 backbone, which is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

The U-Net model is a convolutional neural network that was developed for biomedical image segmentation and has since been applied to various fields, including remote sensing and geospatial analysis. The U-Net model is particularly well-suited for image segmentation tasks due to its ability to capture contextual information and its efficient use of limited training data.

In the pipeline described in the context, the U-Net model is implemented within the arcgis.learn module of the ArcGIS API for Python. This implementation removes the requirement for a large amount of training data and reduces the time and resources spent on ground truth data collection.

Furthermore, the U-Net model in the pipeline has a ResNet-50 backbone, which is a type of CNN that was developed for image recognition tasks. The ResNet-50 backbone is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, which is a large dataset of images that has been used to train many state-of-the-art CNNs. By using a pre-trained ResNet-50 backbone, the U-Net model can leverage the powerful feature extraction capabilities of the ResNet-50 architecture and further improve classification accuracies.

Therefore, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a U-Net model with a ResNet-50 backbone, which is a type of CNN.
