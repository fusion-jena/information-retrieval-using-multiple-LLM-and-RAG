Based on the provided context, there is no information given about the specific platform that was used to deploy the deep learning model. The context discusses various studies and papers that have used deep learning and machine learning techniques for ecological applications, such as predicting productivity models for certain species and studying species distribution. However, it does not mention any specific cloud platforms (such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform) that were used to deploy these models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
