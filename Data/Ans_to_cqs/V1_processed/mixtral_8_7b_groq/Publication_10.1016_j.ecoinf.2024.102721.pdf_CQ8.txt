Based on the information provided, there is no mention of a specific code repository where the deep learning pipeline used in the study "Forecasting ecological water demand of an arid oasis under a drying climate scenario based on deep learning methods" is available. The study does mention that the learning software package used is based on Python, but it does not provide a link to the code repository. It is possible that the code has not been made publicly available. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific location for the code repository.
