The provided context discusses various optimization techniques, including those used in deep learning pipelines, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a popular optimization algorithm used in deep learning. It updates the parameters of the model by computing the gradient of the loss function concerning each parameter, using a single training example at a time. This approach makes SGD computationally efficient and suitable for large datasets. However, SGD may not always converge to the optimal solution due to its stochastic nature.

Adam is another optimization algorithm commonly used in deep learning pipelines. It is an extension of SGD that adaptively adjusts the learning rate for each parameter. Adam uses the moving averages of the gradient and squared gradient to estimate the first and second moments of the gradient, respectively. These estimates help Adam adjust the learning rate for each parameter, making it more robust and efficient than SGD.

The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of SGD or Adam in the optimization of machine learning or deep learning models for dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration prediction. However, it does mention the use of optimization algorithms such as the Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and the Multi-verse Optimizer (MVO) for parameter optimization in DO concentration models. These optimization algorithms are used to optimize the number of neurons in neural networks, error penalty factors in Support Vector Machines (SVM), and other model parameters.

In summary, optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam are commonly used in deep learning pipelines. While the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of SGD or Adam in DO concentration prediction models, it does highlight the importance of optimization algorithms in model parameter optimization.
