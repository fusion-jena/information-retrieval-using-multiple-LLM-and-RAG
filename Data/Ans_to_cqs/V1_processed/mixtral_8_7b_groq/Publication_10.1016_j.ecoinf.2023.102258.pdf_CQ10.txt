Unfortunately, there is no specific code repository link provided in the given context. The text mainly discusses various methods and techniques used in deep learning for bioacoustic event detection, such as transductive few-shot learning, domain adaptation, and meta-learning. However, it does not mention any particular code repository or implementation details.

The context does mention some works like Liu et al. (2018), Hou et al. (2019), Dong et al. (2019), Frazao et al. (2020), Ganchev (2017), Gelderblom et al. (2023), and several authors with their respective works, but it does not provide any direct link to their code repositories.

To find the code repository, you may search for these papers and authors on academic platforms like IEEE Xplore, arXiv, or Google Scholar. Once you find the paper, check the authors' affiliations and look for their personal or institutional websites, where they might have provided a link to the code repository.

For example, for the paper "Few-Shot Bioacoustic Event Detection Using Beats" by Gelderblom et al. (2023), you can search for the paper on DCASE2023 Challenge website or arXiv and look for the code repository link in the authors' provided resources.

Another option is to look into the ICASSP 2023 proceedings or workshops related to bioacoustic event detection and deep learning, as the context mentions some works presented in ICASSP 2023. You can search for the authors' names and their related works in the ICASSP 2023 proceedings and look for the code repository link in their provided resources.

In summary, there is no direct code repository link provided in the context. However, you can search for the papers and authors mentioned in the context on academic platforms and look for the code repository link in their provided resources.
