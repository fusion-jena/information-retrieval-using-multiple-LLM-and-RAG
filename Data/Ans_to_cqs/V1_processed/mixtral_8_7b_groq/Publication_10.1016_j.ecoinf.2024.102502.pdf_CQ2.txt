Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline in the discussed research involves the use of data from the Earth Engine Data Catalog (EOS) of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) online repository. The data is primarily in the form of satellite-derived images, as the focus is on spectral indices derived from these images for earth system research. Therefore, the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is image data.

The `ee.ImageCollection()` constructor is used to retrieve the EOS data catalogue, and filtering is applied to the image collection using functions such as `filterDate` and `clip`. These functions help select a specific period and study area for the data, respectively.

The context does not mention the use of other data formats like audio, video, or CSV files in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is possible that these formats may be used in other stages of the research process, such as data preprocessing or result analysis. Nonetheless, the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline, as described in the context, is image data.
