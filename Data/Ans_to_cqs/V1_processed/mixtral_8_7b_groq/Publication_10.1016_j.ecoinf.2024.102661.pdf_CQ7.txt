In the provided context, there is no explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to split the data into three sets: training, validation, and testing.

The training set is used to train the model, that is, to adjust the model's parameters to minimize the difference between the predicted and actual values. The validation set is used during the training process to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model learns the training data too well, including its noise, and performs poorly on unseen data. The testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance after the training process is completed.

The splitting criteria can vary depending on the specific problem and dataset. A common approach is to use 60-20-20 or 70-15-15 splits for the training, validation, and testing sets, respectively. However, other strategies can be used, such as k-fold cross-validation, where the data is split into k subsets, and the model is trained and validated k times, each time using a different subset as the validation set and the remaining k-1 subsets as the training set.

In summary, while the provided context does not specify the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it is common practice to use a training set, a validation set, and a testing set. The splitting criteria can vary depending on the specific problem and dataset.
