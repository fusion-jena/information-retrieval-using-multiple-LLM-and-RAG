Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation).

However, the text does discuss the use of UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) for dimensionality reduction and visualization of bioclimatic variables in the context of species distribution modeling. UMAP is used to identify groups containing species and near background points, highlighting how bioclimatic heterogeneity between clusters in the reduced dimension translates to geographic regions.

Additionally, the context touches upon the challenge of dealing with multivariate data and the application of dimensionality reduction methods (DRM) to address these problems. Linear DRM, such as Principal Components Analysis, Single Value Decomposition, and Singular Value Decomposition, are mentioned, along with the growing importance of non-linear DRM.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly answer the query regarding data splitting criteria for deep learning model training, it does offer insights into the application of UMAP for species distribution modeling and the use of dimensionality reduction methods for handling multivariate data.
