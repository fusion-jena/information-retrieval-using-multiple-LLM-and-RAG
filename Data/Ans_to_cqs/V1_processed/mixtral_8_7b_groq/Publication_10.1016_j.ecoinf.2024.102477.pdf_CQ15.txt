The provided context discusses the application of deep learning methods in predicting time-series data, specifically the use of SLSTM and SGRU models. However, it does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

Optimization techniques are essential in deep learning as they help minimize the loss function and find the best set of weights and biases for the model. Some commonly used optimization techniques in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSprop, and Adam.

SGD is a simple optimization technique that updates the weights and biases in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function. However, it may not always converge to the optimal solution due to its simplicity.

Adagrad, Adadelta, and RMSprop are adaptive learning rate methods that adjust the learning rate for each parameter based on the historical gradient information. These methods help overcome the limitations of SGD by adapting the learning rate to the parameters' varying importance.

Adam is a popular optimization technique that combines the advantages of Adagrad and RMSprop. It uses the historical gradient information to adapt the learning rate for each parameter and calculates the exponentially decaying average of the past squared gradients to scale the learning rate.

Therefore, while the provided context does not mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it is likely that one of the above optimization techniques was used. It is essential to choose an appropriate optimization technique based on the problem's characteristics and the deep learning model's architecture.
