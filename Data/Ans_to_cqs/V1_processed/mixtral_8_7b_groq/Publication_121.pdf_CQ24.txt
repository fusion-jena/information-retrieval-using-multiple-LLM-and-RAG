The provided context does not give specific information about strategies used to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does discuss the use of transfer learning with MobileNetV3, which can help reduce the impact of randomness in certain aspects of the deep learning pipeline.

Transfer learning is a technique where a pre-trained model is used as a starting point for a new task. In this case, MobileNetV3 models were fine-tuned for plant species identification using a leaf dataset. Fine-tuning involves training the weights of the top layers of these models along with the classifier layer added in the previous step. By using a pre-trained model, the fine-tuning process begins with a set of weights that have already been trained on a large dataset, reducing the impact of randomness during the initial training phases.

Additionally, the context describes the use of a specific optimization algorithm, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), with a learning rate of 0.5 and momentum of 0.9. While this information does not directly relate to handling randomness, it does show that the authors have made specific choices for their training pipeline, suggesting that they have considered the impact of different training parameters on the overall performance of their models.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, the use of transfer learning and specific optimization choices can help mitigate the impact of randomness during model training.
