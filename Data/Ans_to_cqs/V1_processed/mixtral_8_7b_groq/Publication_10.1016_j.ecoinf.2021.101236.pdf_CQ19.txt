The provided context does not explicitly mention which deep learning framework was used to build the model. However, it is mentioned that the model is based on a residual network or ResNet, and that most convolutions use 3 Ã— 3 kernels with padding and are succeeded by batch normalization. Both TensorFlow and PyTorch have extensive support for ResNets and convolutions with batch normalization, making either of them a likely choice for building this model. It is also worth noting that the model was trained using the Adam optimizer, which is available in both TensorFlow and PyTorch. Therefore, while the exact framework is not specified, it is clear that the model was built using a popular deep learning framework that supports ResNets, convolutions, and the Adam optimizer.
