Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the data distribution is 70.12% for training, 1.69% validation, and 28.19% for testing, but it does not specify if it is a stratified split.

The context does mention that the pre-processing stage reduces noises and standardizes inputs, which enhances metrics. But it does not mention any techniques used to address data bias such as oversampling, undersampling or diverse data collection.

Additionally, the context describes the use of two methods, GradCAM (Selvaraju et al., 2017) and SmoothGrad (Smilkov et al., 2017) for qualitative evaluation, but these methods are used for visualizing the features and understanding the model's decision-making process, not for addressing data bias during preprocessing.

In summary, based on the provided context, there is no information about the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
