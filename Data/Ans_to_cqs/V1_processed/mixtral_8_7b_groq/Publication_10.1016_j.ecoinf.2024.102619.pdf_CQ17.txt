The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of any regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of early stopping as a form of regularization. Early stopping is a form of regularization where training is halted as soon as the validation error starts to increase, which can help prevent overfitting by limiting the capacity of the model.

In addition, the context also discusses the use of cross-validation during the training of support vector machines (SVMs), which can also help prevent overfitting. Cross-validation is a technique where the training data is divided into k folds, and the model is trained and validated k times, with each fold serving as the validation set once. This can help prevent overfitting by providing a more robust estimate of the model's performance on unseen data.

It's also worth noting that the use of regularization methods such as dropout and L2 regularization is common practice in deep learning pipelines, and it's possible that they were used in this case but not mentioned in the provided context. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are "dropped out" during training, which can help prevent overfitting by reducing the co-adaptation of neurons. L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is a technique where a penalty term is added to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the model's weights, which can help prevent overfitting by shrinking the weights towards zero.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of dropout or L2 regularization, it does discuss the use of early stopping and cross-validation as forms of regularization. It's also possible that dropout and L2 regularization were used but not mentioned in the provided context.
