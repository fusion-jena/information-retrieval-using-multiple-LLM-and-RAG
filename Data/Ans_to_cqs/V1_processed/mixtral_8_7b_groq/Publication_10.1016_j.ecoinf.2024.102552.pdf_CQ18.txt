Based on the provided context, there is no explicit description of the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The text focuses on the methods and personnel involved in the investigation, resources, validation, and writing - review & editing stages of the project. It also mentions the use of Appendix B for quantifying uncertainty in all stages of analysis and future work to improve the accuracy of the analysis and the propagation of uncertainty. The figure provided shows the recovery from mining between 1944 and 2020, and the potential improvements for mixed-methods analytical historical ecology are discussed. However, the monitoring of the model performance during training is not mentioned. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
