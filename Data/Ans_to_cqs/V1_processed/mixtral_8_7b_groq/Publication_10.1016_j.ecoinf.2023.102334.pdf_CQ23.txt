Based on the provided context, it is not explicitly stated which measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some indications that suggest certain techniques may have been used.

Firstly, the authors mention the need to obtain a substantial number of differential data and address an overfitting issue, which implies that they might have employed techniques such as data augmentation or regularization to increase the size and diversity of the dataset and prevent overfitting.

Secondly, the authors mention the use of two types of data, which suggests that they might have used stratified splitting to ensure that the training and testing sets have a similar distribution of data.

Thirdly, the authors use a module 2 model, as depicted in Figure 4, which may have been trained using cross-validation, a technique that involves dividing the dataset into multiple folds, training the model on different subsets of the data, and averaging the results to improve the model's generalizability.

However, these are only educated guesses based on the provided context. It is possible that other measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, or that none of the above measures were used. Therefore, a definitive answer cannot be provided based on the given context.
