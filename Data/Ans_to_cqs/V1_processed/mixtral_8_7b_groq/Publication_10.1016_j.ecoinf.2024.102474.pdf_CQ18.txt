The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves tracking the validation EarthNetScore (ENS) at the end of each epoch. The validation ENS is used as a metric to assess the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. Specifically, the model's validation score is compared to the scores from previous epochs, and if it fails to improve repeatedly, the optimization process is stopped. This approach allows for the early detection of overfitting, preventing further training from wasting computational resources. The model at the epoch with the highest attained validation score is selected as the final model. This strategy ensures that the model's performance is consistently evaluated during training, and the optimization process is halted when the model's performance plateaus or begins to degrade.
