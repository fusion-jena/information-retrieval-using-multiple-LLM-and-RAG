The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline that employs the AlexNet architecture. However, it is common for CNN models like AlexNet to be trained on large-scale image datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet. These datasets are frequently used in the computer vision community for training and evaluating CNN models.

For instance, MNIST is a dataset of handwritten digits, containing 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 are datasets of 32x32 color images, consisting of 60,000 images in 10 and 100 classes, respectively, with 6,000 images per class. ImageNet is a large-scale dataset of over 14 million images, classified into 21,841 categories, and is commonly used for object detection and image recognition tasks.

In the context of environmental studies, CNN models can be trained on remote sensing datasets, such as those used for water quality monitoring. These datasets may contain spectral reflectance or other environmental measurements, which can be used to estimate cyanobacteria levels or identify and classify various algal species. However, the specific datasets used in the study are not provided in the context.
