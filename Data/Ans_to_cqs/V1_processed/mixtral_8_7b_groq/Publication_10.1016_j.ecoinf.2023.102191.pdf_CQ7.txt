Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The text discusses the development of a marine life monitoring app, data collection, and user feedback, but it does not mention the specific data split criteria. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query without additional information.
