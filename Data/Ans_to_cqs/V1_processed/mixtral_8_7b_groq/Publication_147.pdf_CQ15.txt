The deep learning pipeline in the context provided utilizes the Keras Nadam optimizer, which is a variant of the Adam optimizer. The Nadam optimizer is a combination of Nesterov momentum and the Adam optimizer, and it is used to train the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.

The Adam optimizer is a popular optimization algorithm for training deep learning models. It is an extension of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm, which updates the model weights in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function. The Adam optimizer uses the adaptive learning rate, which means that it adjusts the learning rate for each parameter based on its past gradients. This makes it well suited for problems with sparse gradients.

The Nadam optimizer, on the other hand, incorporates Nesterov momentum into the Adam optimizer. Nesterov momentum is a type of momentum that updates the parameters in the direction of the previous update, rather than the current gradient. This can result in faster convergence and better performance, especially for problems with high dimensionality and complex loss surfaces.

In addition to the Nadam optimizer, the deep learning pipeline also utilizes a combination of binary crossentropy and dice coefficient loss for the objective loss function. Binary crossentropy is a common loss function used to train neural networks, and it measures the entropy between two probability distributions. The dice coefficient loss, on the other hand, is a statistic used to gauge the similarity of two samples. It is commonly used in segmentation tasks, such as the one described in the context, to measure the overlap between the predicted and ground truth segmentation masks.

It is also worth noting that the model was trained using a simple moving window with a stride of 10 and simple label counts were generated. During training, patches were randomly selected from the patch list and randomly rotated left or right. These techniques help to increase the variability of the training data and reduce overfitting.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline described in the context utilizes the Nadam optimizer, a variant of the Adam optimizer, along with binary crossentropy and dice coefficient loss for the objective loss function. Additionally, it uses data augmentation techniques such as random patch selection and rotation to increase the variability of the training data.
