The provided context does not include information on the specific deep learning model used or its hyperparameters. The text primarily discusses a land use and land cover (LULC) study in the Kruger National Park (KNP) using a supervised learning workflow and various classification models such as those proposed by Ren et al. (2003) and Rodriguez-Galiano et al. (2012). However, it does not mention any deep learning models or their hyperparameters. Deep learning models typically have hyperparameters such as learning rate, optimizer, batch size, and number of layers/nodes. Without specific information from the context, I cannot provide the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model for this study.
