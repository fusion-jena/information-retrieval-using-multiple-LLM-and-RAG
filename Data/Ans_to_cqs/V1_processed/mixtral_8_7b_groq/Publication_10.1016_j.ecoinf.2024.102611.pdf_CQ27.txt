The provided context does not give information about the deployment of a deep learning model for medicinal plant species classification. However, it does mention the use of deep learning models for plant leaf recognition and disease detection in single crop species.

In the context, it is mentioned that a deep learning model was used for detecting diseases in single crop species by considering real-time field challenges during image acquisition. Additionally, VGG-16 and ResNet-50 architectures were utilized for classifying plant species with hyperparameter tuning and batch updated stochastic gradient descent technique and fusion learning, respectively. However, there is no information on how these models were deployed as a smartphone-based application or any other platform.

On the other hand, the proposed hierarchical classification model for medicinal plant species classification is not a deep learning model, but it is assessed for practical deployment as a smartphone-based application. The context mentions that the model's efficiency is evaluated using two real-time datasets and validated by two experts. However, there is no information on how the hierarchical classification model is deployed.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot answer the query about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
