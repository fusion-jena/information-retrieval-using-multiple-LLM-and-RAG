In the context provided, the data is split for deep learning model training into two sets: training and testing. The training set consists of 70% of the data, while the testing set includes the remaining 30%. This split is used to evaluate the performance of the model and to ensure that it can generalize well to new, unseen data.

Before splitting the data, the authors add salinity indices, NDSI and NDVI, in different combinations and then use satellite images for training and testing the proposed model. The model is a pixel-based deep learning segmentation architecture.

The training set undergoes normalization and standardization processes to fit into the network. The batch size used for training the network is 32, which is selected to not exceed the memory limit and to make full use of computer resources. The optimizer used for the training process is Adam processing, and the learning rate varies with group based on the cosine functionâ€™s law, often in the range between 0.0 and 1.0. The authors use 100 epochs with an early stopping function to halt the learning process if there is no improvement in accuracy after 20 epochs. The loss function used is the cross-entropy loss function.

It is important to note that the authors do not mention the use of a validation set in their training process. A validation set is typically used during model training to provide an unbiased evaluation of the model's performance. The validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. However, in this case, the authors may have used cross-validation techniques or other methods to prevent overfitting and tune hyperparameters.

In summary, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training include a training set consisting of 70% of the data and a testing set including the remaining 30%. The training set undergoes normalization and standardization processes, and the authors use 100 epochs with an early stopping function and a cross-entropy loss function to train the model. However, the authors do not explicitly mention the use of a validation set in their training process.
