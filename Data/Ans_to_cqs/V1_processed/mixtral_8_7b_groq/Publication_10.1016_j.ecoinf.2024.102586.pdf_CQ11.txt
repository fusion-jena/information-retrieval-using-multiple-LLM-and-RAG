I don't have the specific information you're looking for. The context provided describes a study that involved creating a herbarium dataset of 240 specimen records from 10 invasive species. However, it does not mention or provide a link to any data repository or deep learning pipeline, such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I'm unable to give you a definitive answer to your query.
