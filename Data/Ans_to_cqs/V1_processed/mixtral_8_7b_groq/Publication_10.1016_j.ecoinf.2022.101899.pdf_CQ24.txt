The provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of different runs with varying initial conditions, which can be related to handling randomness.

In the context, there are references to specific runs (e.g., Run 1, Runs 9 and 11) where the authors have set large variances for the intercept and mean temperature. This implies that the authors have intentionally introduced randomness in their models by changing the initial conditions. This approach allows them to observe the behavior of the models under different starting points and assess the robustness of their predictions.

Furthermore, the Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) method, as shown in Fig. 15, can be considered another strategy for handling randomness. BMA is a technique that combines multiple models to produce a final prediction by taking into account the uncertainty associated with each model. This method can help mitigate the impact of randomness in the deep learning pipeline by considering a range of possible outcomes instead of relying on a single model.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does mention the use of different runs with varying initial conditions and the application of Bayesian Model Averaging. These strategies can help manage randomness and improve the robustness of deep learning models.
