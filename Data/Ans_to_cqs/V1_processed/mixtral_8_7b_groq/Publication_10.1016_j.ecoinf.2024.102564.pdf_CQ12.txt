Based on the provided context, the text does not mention the use of any specific deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers in the pipeline. The text discusses the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Random Forests (RF) for modeling net growth in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are computational models inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain, and the text specifies that a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with a hidden layer was used. However, MLP is not considered a deep learning model as it typically contains only one or two hidden layers.

On the other hand, Random Forests (RF) is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. Although RF is a powerful machine learning algorithm, it is not a deep learning model.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the answer to the query is that there is no deep learning model used in the pipeline.
