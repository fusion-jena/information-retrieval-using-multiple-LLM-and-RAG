The text provided describes the process of preparing and training a deep learning model using the VGG16 network from the PyTorch library, but it does not explicitly mention the steps taken to deploy the trained model. However, based on common practices in machine learning model deployment, we can infer some possible steps that might have been taken.

Firstly, after training the model, it is likely that the model was saved to disk using model serialization. Model serialization involves saving the model architecture, weights, and other relevant information to a file, which can be loaded later to make predictions. In PyTorch, this can be achieved using the `torch.save()` function.

Next, the platform for deployment would have been selected. The choice of platform would depend on various factors such as the required latency, throughput, and the infrastructure available. For instance, if the model is to be deployed in a low-latency environment such as a mobile device or a web application, then a lightweight serving framework such as TorchServe or TensorRT might be used. On the other hand, if the model is to be deployed in a high-throughput environment such as a data center, then a distributed serving framework such as TensorFlow Serving or Clipper might be used.

After selecting the platform, the trained model would have been loaded onto the platform. This typically involves loading the serialized model file and configuring the serving framework to use the model for making predictions. The specifics of this step would depend on the serving framework used.

Finally, the model would be integrated into the application or system where it will be used. This might involve writing code to send input data to the model, receive the predictions, and use the predictions to achieve the desired functionality.

It is important to note that these are possible steps that might have been taken based on common practices in model deployment. The text provided does not explicitly mention these steps, so they should be considered as inferred information.
