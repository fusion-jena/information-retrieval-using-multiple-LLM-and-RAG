Based on the provided context, the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly mentioned. However, the context does discuss the use of object-oriented classification in section 4.1 and data processing in section 4.3, which suggests that a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) might be a likely candidate. CNNs are commonly used for image classification tasks due to their ability to effectively learn spatial hierarchies of features from images.

Moreover, the context also mentions the use of kappa statistics in sections 4.4, which is often used to evaluate the performance of classification models, particularly when dealing with imbalanced datasets. CNNs are known to perform well in such scenarios.

However, it's important to note that the context does not explicitly confirm the use of a CNN or any other deep learning model. Therefore, while a CNN is a plausible deep learning model based on the given context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer without further information.
