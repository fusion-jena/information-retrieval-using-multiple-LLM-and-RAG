The provided context does not include specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It mainly focuses on the description of the experimental configurations and results of a study on plant disease detection using deep learning.

However, based on the general knowledge of deep learning applications, data annotation techniques can include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing a box around the object of interest in an image. It is commonly used in object detection tasks, where the goal is to locate and identify objects within an image.

2. Instance segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel of an object in an image. It is more detailed than bounding box annotation, as it provides a precise outline of the object. Instance segmentation is useful in tasks that require understanding the shape and appearance of objects, such as semantic segmentation.

3. Semantic segmentation: This technique involves labeling pixels in an image according to the class or category they belong to, without distinguishing individual instances. It is used in tasks where the focus is on understanding the scene or context, such as scene understanding or autonomous driving.

4. Pixel-level annotation: This technique involves annotating each pixel in an image with a label, similar to instance segmentation. However, pixel-level annotation does not distinguish individual instances and is used in tasks such as saliency detection or depth estimation.

5. Scene text annotation: This technique involves annotating text in images, which can be used for tasks such as text recognition or natural language processing.

The choice of data annotation technique depends on the specific task and the desired outcome. In the context of plant disease detection, instance segmentation or bounding box annotation could be used to annotate the location and extent of diseased areas in plant images.
