The deep learning pipeline in the study uses two main datasets: a specific unnamed dataset of animal call types and the well-known ImageNet dataset.

The animal call types dataset is used as the primary dataset for training the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. This dataset contains 1000 classes of animal calls, and the input data is preprocessed to have a time-frequency window size of 2 seconds. This duration is chosen because it is near the mean and median template duration across target call types. Although most call types have a duration below 1 second, and some are above 2 seconds, the 2-second window size is used to maintain uniform input image sizes for the CNN model.

The study uses a ResNet50 model, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, for transfer learning. ImageNet is a large-scale dataset containing over one million photo images across 1000 classes. It is widely used for computer vision tasks and has been instrumental in advancing deep learning research. In this study, only the feature extraction layers of ResNet50 are used, excluding the remaining layers used for ImageNet classification. These layers are referred to as the network "top" and consist of fully connected (FC) layers for learning a predictive model from the input features.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline in this study uses a specific animal call types dataset for training the CNN model and the ImageNet dataset for transfer learning and feature extraction. The use of these datasets allows the researchers to create a robust and efficient model for animal call classification.
