Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline for analyzing air pollution, specifically carbon monoxide (CO) in Taiwan, uses sensor data. The article "Deep learning-based air pollution analysis on carbon monoxide in Taiwan" mentions the use of deep learning for analyzing CO, but it does not explicitly state how the raw data is collected. However, another article, "Exhaled carbon monoxide: a non-invasive biomarker of short-term exposure to outdoor air pollution," discusses the use of exhaled CO as a biomarker for air pollution exposure, implying the use of sensors to measure CO levels.

Additionally, the context includes references to other studies that use sensors and public datasets for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines. For instance, the article "A soft sensor to estimate the opening of greenhouse vents based on an LSTM-RNN neural network" mentions the use of a long short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM-RNN) for estimating the opening of greenhouse vents based on environmental factors. While the specific data collection method is not mentioned, it is likely that sensors are used to measure the environmental factors.

Furthermore, the article "GA-SVR algorithm for improving forest above ground biomass estimation using SAR data" uses synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data for estimating forest above-ground biomass. In this case, the raw data is collected through remote sensing, which is a type of public dataset.

Finally, the article "ARIMA forecasting of ambient air pollutants (O3, NO, NO2 and CO)" uses historical data of air pollutants to forecast future levels. This data is likely collected through public datasets, as the article mentions using data from regulatory agencies.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline for analyzing air pollution can use sensors, public datasets, and remote sensing for collecting raw data. Sensors can be used to measure air pollution levels, public datasets can provide historical data and regulatory information, and remote sensing can be used for large-scale data collection.
