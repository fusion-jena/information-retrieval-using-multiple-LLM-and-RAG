Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, the context does discuss the use of UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) for dimensionality reduction in various fields such as genomics, image analysis, and population ecology.

In the context "species distribution modeling based on remote sensing imagery: how to capture fine-grained and large-scale vegetation ecology with convolutional neural networks?" the authors use deep learning models for species distribution modeling. While the text does not explicitly mention data annotation techniques, it is important to note that for successful training of deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), appropriate data annotation is crucial.

In image analysis, common data annotation techniques include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing a box around the object of interest in an image. It is useful for object detection tasks where the goal is to identify the location of an object within an image.
2. Instance segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel of an object in an image. It is useful for semantic segmentation tasks where the goal is to classify each pixel in an image into a specific class.

For species distribution modeling based on remote sensing imagery, data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation can be used to label the vegetation of interest in satellite or aerial images. These labeled images can then be used to train deep learning models, such as CNNs, for species distribution modeling.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it is important to note that appropriate data annotation is crucial for successful training of deep learning models. Common data annotation techniques in image analysis include bounding box annotation and instance segmentation.
