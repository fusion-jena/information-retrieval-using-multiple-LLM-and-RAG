Based on the provided context, there is no mention of a deep learning model being deployed. The article discusses the use of machine-learning techniques, specifically Random Forest, to build prediction models for sustainable fishing in the Indian Ocean.

The process followed to build these models includes:

1. Data collection and preprocessing: The authors used data from various sources, including research vessel surveys and satellite tracking, to study the distribution of four tuna species in the Indian Ocean. They preprocessed the data to extract relevant features for their models.
2. Variable selection: The authors identified a set of predictor variables (given in Table 3 of the context) that were significant in explaining the distribution of the tuna species.
3. Model training: The authors trained a Random Forest model for each species using the selected predictor variables. They used 5 Ã— 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate the performance of the models and found that Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy for all species.
4. Model validation: The authors validated the trained models by predicting the probabilities of finding high and low catches and absences of each species in the study area. The results of the validation are shown in Table 5 of the context.

There is no mention of model serialization or platform selection in the provided context. Therefore, it is not possible to answer the query about the deployment process of a deep learning model.
