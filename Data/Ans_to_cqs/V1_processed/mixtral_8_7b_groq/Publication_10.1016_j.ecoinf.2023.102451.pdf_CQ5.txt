The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline, as described in the provided context, is the Environmental Microorganisms Dataset EMDS-6. This dataset consists of 840 different images of environmental microorganisms, distributed across 21 categories with 40 images each. The EMDS-6 dataset is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed architecture, EMViT-Net, and to compare it with other deep learning models. The dataset is used for training, validation, and testing, and the performance of the models is measured in terms of average precision, recall, and F1-score for all categories. The EMViT-Net model outperforms other deep learning models in classifying environmental microorganisms into 21 categories using the EMDS-6 dataset.
