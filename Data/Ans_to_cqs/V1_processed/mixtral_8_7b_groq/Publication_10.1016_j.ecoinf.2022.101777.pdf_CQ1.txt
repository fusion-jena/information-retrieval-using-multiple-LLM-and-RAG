Furthermore, the context also mentions specific dates and Sentinel-2 satellite data (S2A\_MSI\_L1C and S2B\_MSI\_2A), which suggests that remote sensing data may also be used in addition to sensor data. Remote sensing data can be a valuable source of information for deep learning pipelines, especially in the field of ecological informatics.
