The strategy for monitoring model performance during training can be inferred from the text "Cetin, M., IsikPekkan, O., OzenenKavlak, M., et al., 2022. GIS-based forest fire risk determination for Milas district." The authors mention using GIS (Geographic Information System) for forest fire risk determination. In the context of machine learning model training, monitoring model performance typically involves techniques such as evaluating loss functions, assessing model accuracy, and validating predictions against actual data. In the case of GIS-based forest fire risk determination, the model performance could be monitored by comparing the predicted fire risk areas with the actual fire incidents in the Milas district. This can help ensure that the model is accurately predicting fire risk areas and making any necessary adjustments during the training process.
