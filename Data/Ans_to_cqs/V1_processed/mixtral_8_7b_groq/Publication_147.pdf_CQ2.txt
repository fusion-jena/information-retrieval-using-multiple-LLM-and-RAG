The deep learning pipeline in the study discussed uses remote sensing data in the form of images as its primary data format. More specifically, the data sources used include Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1, which are Earth observation satellites operated by the European Space Agency. These satellites capture multispectral and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, respectively.

From Sentinel-2, the deep learning pipeline uses bands 2, 3, and 4, which correspond to blue, green, and red visible light wavelengths, respectively. Additionally, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), difference normalized vegetation index (dNDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), and proportion of photosynthetically active radiation index (PSRI) are derived from the Sentinel-2 data. These indices are calculated using specific equations that consider the reflectance values of different bands.

The digital elevation model (DEM) from the ALOS satellite is another data source used in the deep learning pipeline. A DEM is a raster dataset that represents the elevation of the Earth's surface.

Sentinel-1 SAR data is used to calculate the radar intensity (POLr) variable. SAR data can penetrate clouds and vegetation, providing information even when optical data is not available.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline in this study uses image data formats, specifically multispectral and SAR data, from Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1, and ALOS satellites. Additionally, the pipeline uses derived indices and the DEM, which are also in raster image format.
