The context provided does not give information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It mentions the use of a deep learning network (Faster R-CNN) and a dataset (PST) for training, but it does not specify the hardware used in the training process. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query.
