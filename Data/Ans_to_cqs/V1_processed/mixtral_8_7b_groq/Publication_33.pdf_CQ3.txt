The provided context discusses the use of deep learning algorithms for biodiversity monitoring, specifically for classifying organisms in underwater images. However, it does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.

However, I can provide some general information about data annotation techniques that are commonly used in deep learning, especially for object detection and image segmentation tasks.

One common data annotation technique is bounding box annotation, where a bounding box is drawn around the object of interest in an image. This technique is often used for object detection tasks, where the goal is to locate and classify objects in an image. The bounding box provides the location and size of the object, and the class label is assigned to the object within the bounding box.

Instance segmentation is another data annotation technique that is used for image segmentation tasks. In instance segmentation, each instance of an object is segmented from the background and from other instances of the same object. This technique provides a pixel-level mask for each instance of the object, allowing for more precise localization and segmentation than bounding box annotation.

In the context of biodiversity monitoring, data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation and instance segmentation can be used to annotate underwater images with the location and species of organisms. These annotations can then be used to train deep learning models for object detection and image segmentation, allowing for automated identification and monitoring of biodiversity.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it is likely that techniques such as bounding box annotation and instance segmentation were used for annotating underwater images in the studies mentioned in the context.
