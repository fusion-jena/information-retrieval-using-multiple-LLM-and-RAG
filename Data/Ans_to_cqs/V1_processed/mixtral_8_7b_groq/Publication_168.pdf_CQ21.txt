Based on the provided context, there are no specific details mentioned about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, or creating a confusion matrix. However, the context does provide information about the evaluation of the classification performance of the proposed Spatial and Spectral Parallel CNN (SSPCNN) model.

After training the model using the labeled pixels of the UAV hyperspectral image, the classification performance is evaluated using the test samples. The classification map of the whole image is generated and visually inspected for its effectiveness. Moreover, the classification maps obtained by other methods, such as SVM and 1-D-CNN, are compared with the SSPCNN classification map to highlight the advantages of using spatial information in addition to spectral information for image classification.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention any postprocessing steps like saliency maps or confusion matrix calculation, it does provide information about evaluating the classification performance by generating a classification map and comparing it with other methods.
