Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the CA-Hybrid network, which is a deep learning model, was designed to improve its generalizability. One of the measures taken was the introduction of the Class Activation Mapping (CAM) in the CNN module of the CA-Hybrid network. The CAM helps the network focus more on critical features, thereby enhancing its generalization ability.

Additionally, the network was evaluated for its performance on both small objects (pixels less than 32*32) and medium objects (pixels between 32*32 and 96*96). The results showed that the medium objects achieved higher classification accuracy compared to small objects under identical network conditions. This suggests that the network performs better when classifying larger objects, which could be due to the network's ability to extract more meaningful features from larger objects.

However, the context does not explicitly mention any other measures such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. It is possible that these techniques were used but not mentioned in the provided text.

In summary, the CA-Hybrid network was designed to improve its generalizability by introducing the CAM in the CNN module and evaluating its performance on both small and medium objects. While the text does not explicitly mention other measures such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, it is possible that these techniques were used.
