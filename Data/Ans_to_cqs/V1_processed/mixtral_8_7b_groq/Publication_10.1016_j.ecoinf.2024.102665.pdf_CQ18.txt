Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context discusses various studies related to coral reefs, marine pollution, and machine learning techniques for data analysis. However, it does not mention any details about monitoring the model performance during training.

It is important to monitor model performance during training to ensure that the model is learning effectively and to detect any issues such as overfitting or underfitting. Common strategies for monitoring model performance during training include using validation sets, plotting training and validation loss, and implementing early stopping.

Without more information, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to the query. However, it is clear that monitoring model performance during training is a crucial step in the machine learning process, and it is likely that some strategy was implemented in the studies mentioned in the context, but it was not included in the provided text.
