Based on the provided context, there is no information about a deep learning model being used in the assessment of datasets with the F-UJI tool. The F-UJI tool is used to evaluate the FAIRness of datasets, which refers to the degree to which they adhere to the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability principles. The tool uses the OpenAPI Specification (OAS) to assess the datasets and produces JSON files containing the assessment results.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query about the purpose of a deep learning model in this context.
