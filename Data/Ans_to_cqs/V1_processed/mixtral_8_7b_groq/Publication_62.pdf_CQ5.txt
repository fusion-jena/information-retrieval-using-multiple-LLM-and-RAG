Based on the information provided, the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that the pipeline involves the training of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks, using unstained and stained images of specimens from natural history collections (NHCs).

The context includes descriptions of the architecture of the CNNs, with details about the number of layers, layer types, and tensor shapes. Additionally, there are references to Mathematica notebooks and annotated notebooks that were used to define and train these CNNs (Suppl. materials 1, 2, 3, 4). However, the specific datasets used in the training process are not specified.

In general, when working with CNNs for image classification tasks, researchers often use benchmark datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. These datasets are widely adopted in the machine learning community due to their large size, diverse content, and well-established evaluation metrics. However, the context provided here does not explicitly mention the use of any of these standard datasets.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer regarding the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.

 Not enough information is provided to determine the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
