The hyperparameters used in the deep learning models vary depending on the specific architecture and task. For action recognition, the three ResNet variants are trained using the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer with an initial learning rate of 0.001, which is decreased every 10 epochs by a factor of Î³ = 0.1. The training process lasts for 40 epochs, and in the first epoch, warmup iterations are used for the learning rate with a warmup factor of 1/1000. A momentum of 0.9 and weight decay of 0.0005 are also used. In contrast, the SlowFast architecture uses a different setup for action recognition. It is trained for 40 epochs with an initial base learning rate of 0.1, which is decreased using a cosine strategy. Warmup epochs are used, with a warmup learning rate of 0.001 and 5 warmup epochs in total. The momentum is set to 0.9, and the weight decay parameter is 0.0004.

For object detection, a Mask R-CNN model is used, built around the PyTorch detection model of Mask R-CNN. The optimizer used for this model is not specified in the context, but it is mentioned that the models are trained using PyTorch training functions. The Mask R-CNN model is pretrained on the COCO 2017train dataset, while the ResNets are pretrained on the Kinetics-400 dataset.

In summary, the hyperparameters used in the deep learning models include the learning rate, optimizer, momentum, weight decay, and number of epochs. The specific values used depend on the architecture and task, with the ResNet variants and SlowFast architecture using different setups for action recognition and the Mask R-CNN model using a different setup for object detection.
