The provided context does not include specific information about data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does provide a detailed explanation of the basics of neural networks and deep learning, as well as some examples of their applications.

To answer the query, I will provide a general explanation of data augmentation techniques that are commonly used in deep learning.
Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the amount of training data by applying various transformations to the existing data. This can help improve the performance of deep learning models by providing more diverse and representative data.

Some common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning include:

* Flipping: This involves flipping the image horizontally or vertically. This can help the model learn to recognize features that are invariant to orientation.
* Rotating: This involves rotating the image by a certain angle. This can help the model learn to recognize features that are invariant to rotation.
* Scaling: This involves scaling the image up or down. This can help the model learn to recognize features that are invariant to size.
* Translation: This involves shifting the image horizontally or vertically. This can help the model learn to recognize features that are invariant to position.
* Cropping: This involves randomly cropping a portion of the image. This can help the model learn to recognize features that are important regardless of the context.
* Color jittering: This involves randomly changing the brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue of the image. This can help the model learn to recognize features that are invariant to color.
* Flipping, rotating, scaling, and translation are the most common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning.

It's worth noting that the specific data augmentation techniques used will depend on the task and the dataset. For example, for image classification tasks, flipping, rotating, scaling, and translation are commonly used, while for natural language processing tasks, techniques such as word embedding, stemming, and lemmatization are commonly used.

In summary, data augmentation is a technique used to increase the amount of training data by applying various transformations to the existing data. Common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning include flipping, rotating, scaling, translation, cropping, and color jittering. The specific data augmentation techniques used will depend on the task and the dataset.
