The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the mean average precision (mAP) metric, with a subscript 50, referred to as mAP50. This metric calculates the mean of species-specific average precision, where the area of intersection of the ground truth bounding box and the predicted bounding box should be at least 50% of the area of the union of both for a true species identification. The network outputs a belief between 0 and 1 for species identification, which is then thresholded using the weighted harmonic mean between specificity and recall, with α∈[0,1] and S, R∈(0,1]. Eα reduces to R for α=0 and to S for α=1, while E0.5 considers specificity and recall with equal weight.

Additionally, the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) is sometimes used for classification. However, it is not preferred in this case because it is a single number that does not allow for mediation between the two use cases.

The provided context does not mention the use of accuracy, precision, or recall metrics to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model.
