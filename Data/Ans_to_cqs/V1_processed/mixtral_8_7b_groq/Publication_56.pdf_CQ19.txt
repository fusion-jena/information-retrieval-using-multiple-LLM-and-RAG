The context provided does not give specific information about the deep learning frameworks used in the studies mentioned. However, it is mentioned that these studies involve the use of deep learning models in remote sensing and agricultural applications. Common deep learning frameworks used for such applications include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. TensorFlow, developed by Google Brain, is a popular open-source library for machine learning and artificial intelligence. PyTorch, developed by Facebook's AI Research lab, is another widely used open-source machine learning library. Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano.

An example of a deep learning framework used in remote sensing applications is the DeepGlobe challenge, which used TensorFlow as its official deep learning framework. The DeepGlobe challenge focused on three remote sensing tasks: building semantic segmentation, building building detection, and road extraction models.

In summary, while the context does not provide specific information on the deep learning frameworks used in the mentioned studies, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras are commonly used frameworks for deep learning applications in remote sensing and agriculture.
