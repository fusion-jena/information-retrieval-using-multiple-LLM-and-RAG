In the context provided, the preprocessing techniques mentioned are specifically applied before using a deep learning model for object detection in remote sensing images. These techniques are aimed at improving the candidate regions for detection and optimizing the accuracy and execution time of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) detectors.

The preprocessing steps mentioned are:

1. Eliminating the background using a threshold based on the high albedo (light color): This step involves removing the background of the image using a threshold based on the high albedo or light color. This helps in focusing on the region of interest and reducing the computational cost.

However, the context does not explicitly mention other common preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization is the process of scaling the pixel values to a specific range, often between 0 and 1. Scaling involves adjusting the range of pixel values to match the input range required by the deep learning model. Cleaning refers to the removal of noise and artifacts from the image that might interfere with the training process.

In general, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model can vary depending on the nature of the problem and the type of data. Common preprocessing steps include:

1. Data augmentation: This involves creating new training examples by applying random transformations such as rotation, scaling, and flipping to the existing data. This helps in increasing the size of the training set and improving the generalization of the model.
2. Normalization: This involves scaling the pixel values to a specific range, often between 0 and 1. This helps in improving the training stability and convergence of the model.
3. Scaling: This involves adjusting the range of pixel values to match the input range required by the deep learning model.
4. Cleaning: This involves the removal of noise and artifacts from the image that might interfere with the training process.
5. Resizing: This involves resizing the image to match the input size required by the deep learning model.

Therefore, while the context provides specific preprocessing techniques for object detection in remote sensing images, the general preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model can include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and others, depending on the problem at hand.
