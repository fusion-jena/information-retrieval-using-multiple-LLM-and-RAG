The provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses a study related to Whale-Tale Hidden Markov Model (WT-HMM) used for cetacean vocalization classification, and how its performance varies with different dataset sizes. However, it does not mention or provide a link to the data repository where the deep learning pipeline or the dataset can be found. Therefore, I am unable to provide the data repository link based on the given context.
