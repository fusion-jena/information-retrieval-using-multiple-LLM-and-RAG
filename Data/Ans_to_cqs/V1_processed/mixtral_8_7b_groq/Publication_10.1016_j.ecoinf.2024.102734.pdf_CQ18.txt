The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of a validation set and training metrics. By default, the grid view mode assigns samples to training or validation sets, maintaining an 80/20% training-validation split for each class. This allows for the model's performance to be evaluated on unseen data during the training process. The user can view training metrics through the training tab, which provides insights into how well the model is learning.

Additionally, the system allows for the manual selection of samples for training, providing the opportunity to apply active learning techniques. Active learning involves selecting the most informative samples for labeling and using them to fine-tune the model. This can be done using low-certainty samples, which lie along decision boundaries, or high-certainty samples, which are in close proximity to prototypical embeddings. By comparing the model performance with these different sample orderings, the user can monitor how well the model is learning and make informed decisions about which samples to use for fine-tuning.

The system also includes a feature extraction model selection section, where the performance of different feature extraction models can be evaluated. This allows for the selection of the most effective model for the task at hand, further monitoring the model's performance during training.

Overall, the strategy for monitoring the model performance during training involves the use of a validation set, training metrics, active learning techniques, and the evaluation of feature extraction models. This comprehensive approach ensures that the model's performance is closely monitored throughout the training process, allowing for informed decisions to be made about model selection and fine-tuning.
