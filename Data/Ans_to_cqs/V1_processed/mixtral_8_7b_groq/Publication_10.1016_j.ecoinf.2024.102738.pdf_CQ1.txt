The provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of various datasets in the analysis process. These datasets (referred to as Dataset 1 to Dataset 31) have been used for calculating different spectral indices, vegetation indices, soil indices, and water indices. 

Additionally, the context mentions the use of LULC (Land Use/Land Cover) classes based on the CLC (Corine Land Cover) methodology. This suggests that the data might have been collected using remote sensing techniques, such as satellite or aerial imaging, which are common methods for collecting large-scale geospatial data.

The use of spectral bands, vegetation indices, soil indices, and water indices also suggests the use of multispectral or hyperspectral imagery, which are typically collected using sensors mounted on satellites, aircraft, or drones.

However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of surveys, public datasets, or other methods for collecting raw data. Therefore, a definitive answer cannot be provided based on the given information.
