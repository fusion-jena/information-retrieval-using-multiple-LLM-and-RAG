Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of a modified EfficientNetV2 network for detecting benthic organisms, but it does not mention where the data or code for this pipeline can be found. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
