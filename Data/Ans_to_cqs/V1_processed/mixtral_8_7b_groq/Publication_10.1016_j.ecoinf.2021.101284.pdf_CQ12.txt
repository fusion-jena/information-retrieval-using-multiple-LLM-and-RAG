Based on the provided context, there is no information about the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. The context discusses various topics related to data processing, analysis, and modeling, but it does not mention any details about the deep learning model used for diagnosing COVID-19 patients based on X-ray and computed tomography images.

The context references a paper by Castillo (2020) that discusses the early diagnosis of COVID-19 patients using a deep learning algorithm, but it does not specify the type of deep learning model used. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional information.
