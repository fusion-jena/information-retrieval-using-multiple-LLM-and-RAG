Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the use of phenological knowledge as input data to improve the performance of deep learning in Landsat image classification, specifically for the detection of invasive S. alterniflora. It mentions the use of a deep learning classifier, but it does not detail the data augmentation techniques used.

Data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in deep learning to increase the size of the training dataset and prevent overfitting. Flipping involves horizontally or vertically flipping the images in the dataset. Rotating involves rotating the images by a certain angle. Scaling involves changing the size of the images.

Without more information from the text, it is not possible to provide a specific answer regarding the data augmentation techniques used in this study. However, it is mentioned that a comparison experiment was conducted between a Stacked Auto-Encoder (SAE) and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with six different types of Landsat images. It is possible that data augmentation techniques were applied to the Landsat images used in this comparison, but the text does not provide enough information to confirm this.
