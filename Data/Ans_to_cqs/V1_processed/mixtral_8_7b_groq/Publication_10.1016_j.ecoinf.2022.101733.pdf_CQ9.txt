Based on the information provided, there is no mention of a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline's data is available, such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. The context focuses on the use of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform for processing big geospatial data, particularly in the context of citrus training and validation samples. The data used in the study may be specific to the GEE platform or sourced from elsewhere but uploaded to GEE for the purposes of the study. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific data repository for the deep learning pipeline's data.
