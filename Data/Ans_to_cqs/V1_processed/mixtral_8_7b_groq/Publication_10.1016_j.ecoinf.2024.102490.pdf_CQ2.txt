The provided context does not include information about the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of climatic variables such as precipitation and temperature seasonality in the study. These variables are likely represented as numerical data, possibly in a CSV format, which is a common format for inputting data into machine learning algorithms.

The study also mentions the use of various machine learning techniques, including XGBOOST, GBM, RF, MaxEnt, and ANN. While the context does not explicitly state the data formats used for these techniques, it is likely that they also use numerical data in a format such as CSV.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific information about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, it is likely that numerical data in a format such as CSV is used for inputting climatic variables into machine learning algorithms.
