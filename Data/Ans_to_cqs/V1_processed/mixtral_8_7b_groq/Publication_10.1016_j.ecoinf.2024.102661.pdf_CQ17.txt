The provided context discusses the use of L2 regularization as a method to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, specifically in the context of an LSTM model. L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, works by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This penalty term discourages large weight values, which can lead to overfitting, and encourages the model to distribute the importance of features more evenly.

In the given context, the L2 regularization parameter is denoted as λ, and its search range is set between 1e-2 and 1e-10. The optimal value of λ is determined during the training process of the TPEBO-LSTM model, where the model logs the chosen hyperparameter combinations, associated training times, and loss values to identify the hyperparameter sets that deliver optimal performance.

However, the context does not mention the use of dropout as a regularization method. Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly sets a fraction of the input units to zero during training, which helps prevent overfitting by reducing the co-adaptation of feature detectors.

In summary, the provided context discusses the use of L2 regularization as a method to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, specifically in the context of an LSTM model. The search range for the L2 regularization parameter is set between 1e-2 and 1e-10, and its optimal value is determined during the training process of the TPEBO-LSTM model. Dropout regularization is not mentioned in the context.
