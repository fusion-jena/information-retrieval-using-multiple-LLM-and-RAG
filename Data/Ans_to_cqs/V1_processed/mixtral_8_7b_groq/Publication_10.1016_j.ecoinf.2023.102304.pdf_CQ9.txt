Based on the provided context, there is no information about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository for it. The context consists of various research papers that use different methods and indices for vegetation type analysis, landcover change, and wildfire-related studies. However, none of them mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository for it on platforms such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.

An example of a study mentioned in the context is by Gorelick et al. (2017), which focuses on the Google Earth Engine for planetary-scale geospatial analysis. While this study uses satellite data and analysis tools, it does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository for it.

Another study by Greve et al. (2019) investigates the aridity index under global warming. This paper uses climate model data and statistical methods but does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository.

Guerschman et al. (2020) study vegetation cover dependence on accumulated antecedent precipitation in Australia. They use remote sensing data and various vegetation indices, but there is no information about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository in their study.

In summary, the provided context does not contain information about the data repository for a deep learning pipeline.
