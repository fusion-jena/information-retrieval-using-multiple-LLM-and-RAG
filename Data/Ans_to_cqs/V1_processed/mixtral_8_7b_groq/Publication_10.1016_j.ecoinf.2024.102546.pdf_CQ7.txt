The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as train, test, and validation sets, are not specified in the provided context. However, it is common practice in machine learning to split the data into these three subsets to evaluate the performance and generalization of the model.

Typically, the data is split into three sets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune the hyperparameters and select the best model, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final performance of the selected model.

The exact proportions for splitting the data can vary, but a common approach is to use 70% of the data for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. Another approach is to use 60% for training, 20% for validation, and 20% for testing. The choice of split depends on the size of the dataset and the specific requirements of the problem.

In the provided context, the authors use a cross-season weed detection approach, where they train a deep learning model on data from one season and test it on data from another season. This approach is used to evaluate the robustness and generalization of the model across different seasons. However, the criteria for splitting the data within each season are not specified.

In summary, while the specific criteria for splitting the data for deep learning model training are not provided in the context, it is common practice to use a training, validation, and testing split. The exact proportions can vary, and the choice depends on the size of the dataset and the specific requirements of the problem.
