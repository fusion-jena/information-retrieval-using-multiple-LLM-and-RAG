The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a grid search, as mentioned in the context. Grid search is a traditional yet effective method for hyperparameter tuning in machine learning models. It involves systematically exploring a manually specified subset of the hyperparameter space, which is essentially a grid of hyperparameter values. The model is trained for each combination of hyperparameters in this grid, and the performance of the model is evaluated using a specified metric. The combination of hyperparameters that results in the best performance is then selected for the final model. In this particular case, the number of trees (ntrees) was optimized using a grid search, and the best number of trees was found to be 500.
