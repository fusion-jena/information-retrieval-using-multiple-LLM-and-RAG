The criteria used to split data for deep learning model training, such as into training, validation, and test sets, are not specified in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the Pl@ntNet model is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and then fine-tuned on Pl@ntNet data. This suggests that a portion of the Pl@ntNet data is used for fine-tuning, while the rest is used for evaluation.

In general, there are several common strategies for splitting data in machine learning. One approach is to randomly split the data into a training set and a test set, with a typical split being 80% for training and 20% for testing. This allows for evaluation of the model's performance on unseen data.

Another approach is to use a technique called cross-validation, where the data is split into multiple folds, and the model is trained and evaluated on different subsets of the data. This can help to reduce overfitting and provide a more robust estimate of the model's performance.

In the context of deep learning, it is also common to use a validation set during the training process. The validation set is a separate subset of the training data that is used to evaluate the model's performance during training. This allows for adjustment of hyperparameters and early stopping of the training process if performance on the validation set stops improving.

It is important to note that the specific criteria used for splitting the data can depend on the size and nature of the data, as well as the specific goals of the model. In the case of the Pl@ntNet model, the large amount of data available (30,261 species and 2.9 million images) may allow for more sophisticated splitting strategies. However, the specific details of how the data was split for training and evaluation are not provided in the given context.
