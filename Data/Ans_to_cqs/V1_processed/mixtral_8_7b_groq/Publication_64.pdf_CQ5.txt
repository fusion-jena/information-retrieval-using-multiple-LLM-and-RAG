The deep learning pipeline in question uses three datasets for training and testing the ResNet50 model: Google Image Search, Portuguese Flora, and iNaturalist. 

For the Google Image Search dataset, the 3680 labels with more than 12 images in the training dataset are selected. The first 10 images returned by the Google Image Search engine are automatically retrieved for each of these labels. This dataset may contain some minor mislabeled or corrupt examples, but the authors expect to minimize their presence by choosing popular labels and retrieving the top results.

The Portuguese Flora dataset is another dataset used in this pipeline. However, there is no detailed information provided about this dataset in the context.

The iNaturalist dataset is the third dataset used in this pipeline. Again, there is no detailed information provided about this dataset in the context.

The authors use these datasets to evaluate the performance of their model and compare it with the ResNet50 (paper) model. They report the top-1 and top-5 accuracy for each dataset.

For training the model, the authors use the PlantNet dataset, which consists of around 250K images belonging to more than 6K plant species of Western Europe. This dataset is highly unbalanced, with most labels containing very few images. The authors train the model on the whole dataset without making validation or test splits. They use three external datasets, including Google Image Search, Portuguese Flora, and iNaturalist, to measure the performance of their net confidently at test time.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline uses the PlantNet dataset for training the ResNet50 model and the Google Image Search, Portuguese Flora, and iNaturalist datasets for testing and evaluating the model's performance.
