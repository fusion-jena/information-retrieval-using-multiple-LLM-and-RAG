The text provided discusses the performance of a deep learning model for leaf-based plant species identification, but it does not explicitly specify the evaluation metrics used. However, based on common practice in machine learning and the context of the text, it can be inferred that the model's performance is evaluated using accuracy.

In the "Deep Learning Experiment" section, the text mentions "top-5 accuracy" and "top-1 accuracy". Top-k accuracy is a type of classification accuracy where a prediction is considered correct if the true label is in the top k predicted labels. Here, "top-1 accuracy" refers to the conventional accuracy metric, where a prediction is deemed correct if the predicted label matches the true label.

Additionally, in the "Hand-crafted Feature Extraction Experiment" section, the text only mentions the accuracy metric, with no other metrics being mentioned. This further supports the inference that accuracy is the primary evaluation metric for the deep learning model's performance.

To summarize, while the text does not explicitly state the evaluation metrics used, it can be inferred that the deep learning model's performance is assessed using accuracy, with mentions of top-1 and top-5 accuracy.
