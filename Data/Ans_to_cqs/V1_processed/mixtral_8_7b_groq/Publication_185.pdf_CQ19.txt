The specific deep learning framework used to build the model in the given context is Caffe. This was mentioned in the statement "The model was trained using stochastic gradient descent and the backpropagation algorithm included in Caffe." Caffe is a deep learning framework made with expression, speed, and modularity in mind, and it is developed by Berkeley AI Research (BAIR). It is commonly used for image classification and other computer vision tasks. Other popular deep learning frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras.
