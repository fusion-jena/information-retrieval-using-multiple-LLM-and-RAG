The purpose of the deep learning model in the study is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is used for image classification. The study compares the performance of a deep learning model called Stacked Autoencoder (SAE) with a traditional machine learning method called Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classifying Landsat images. Specifically, the study aims to evaluate the hypothesis that applying phenological knowledge as input data of deep learning can improve the performance in the detection of invasive S. alterniflora. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model in this study is used for image classification, with the goal of improving the detection of specific features (invasive plant species) in the images.
