The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the primary data format used is underwater optical images, as the entire context discusses improving the detection and analysis of objects within underwater images.

The original YOLOv8 network, as well as the modified CSMB module, process feature maps derived from underwater optical images. These feature maps are likely in a multi-dimensional numerical format, such as ℝN×H×W×C, where N represents the batch size, C represents the channel number, and H and W denote the height and width, respectively.

Although the context focuses on underwater optical images, it does not exclude the possibility of other data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline. For instance, auxiliary data such as metadata (e.g., environmental conditions, object labels) could be stored in CSV or other tabular formats. Additionally, the pipeline might involve pre-processing or post-processing steps that handle audio, video, or other data formats. However, the provided context does not contain sufficient information to confirm the use of these data formats.

In summary, the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline described in the context is underwater optical images, but other data formats (e.g., CSV, audio, video) might be used in auxiliary roles or during pre-processing or post-processing stages.
