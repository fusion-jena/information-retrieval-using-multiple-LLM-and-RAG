Based on the provided context, there is no information that a deep learning model was used. However, I can provide information on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model used in the study, which is XGBoost, a gradient boosting machine learning algorithm.

To ensure the generalizability of the XGBoost model, the study used a nested k-fold cross-validation scheme. The dataset was split into three subsets: a tuning set (k-2 folds), a validation set (1-fold), and a test set (1-fold). The model was trained on the tuning set, and the performance was monitored on the validation set by calculating the out-of-sample prediction accuracy and taking the median of k-1 folds. This process was repeated k times, resulting in k medians for each number of iterations.

The study also used a large ensemble size for XGBoost, but they noted that large ensemble sizes could cause overfitting due to the gradient technique focusing on the most difficult cases, which can be due to noise. To avoid the overfitting issue, they used a regularization technique.

However, the provided context does not mention any information about a diverse dataset or stratified splitting. Therefore, it is not possible to answer whether these measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
