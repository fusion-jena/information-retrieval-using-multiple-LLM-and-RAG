I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context includes information about the use of PyTorch, a deep learning framework, and skorch, a library that makes it easier to use PyTorch with scikit-learn. It also mentions the use of the VGG16 feature extractor and the training of a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. However, there is no information about where the data used in this pipeline can be found. Therefore, I am unable to provide the data repository link. I hope this information is helpful, and I apologize for any inconvenience.
