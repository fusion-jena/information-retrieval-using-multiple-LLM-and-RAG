Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline in this case utilizes audio data formats. The context discusses the use of different audio recording systems, such as SongMeter and AudioMoth, for collecting acoustic data of songbirds. The data is recorded with specific sample schemes, frequencies, and gains, which are all relevant characteristics for audio data.

The SongMeter has a sample frequency (FS) of 44.1 kHz and 48 kHz, and a gain of 16 dB. The AudioMoth has a sample frequency of 48 kHz and a medium gain setting. These settings are crucial for the pre-processing of audio data before feeding it into a deep learning pipeline.

In the context, there is no mention of image, video, or CSV data formats. Therefore, based on the given information, the deep learning pipeline in this specific scenario deals only with audio data formats.

Another important aspect of the context is the focus on reducing device bias in acoustic data. This is relevant for deep learning, as consistent feature spaces are required for successful machine learning and deep learning models. By minimizing the differences between recording devices, the resulting audio data can be used more effectively in deep learning applications.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline discussed in the provided context deals primarily with audio data formats, specifically those recorded using SongMeter and AudioMoth devices. The data is characterized by specific frequencies and gain settings, which are important for the pre-processing of audio data.
