The provided context discusses a deep learning study that uses the ResNet architecture for a classification task, but it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. However, it does mention data augmentation techniques that were used to compensate for the high class imbalance and improve generalization.

Data augmentation techniques are a common way to increase the diversity of the training data and prevent overfitting. In this study, data augmentation was performed on all patches by applying random rotations between 0 and 180 degrees, brightness scaling between 0.4 and 1.6, and horizontal/vertical flipping. These techniques help to increase the variability of the training data and prevent overfitting to specific patterns in the data.

While data augmentation can help to compensate for class imbalance, other techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, and stratified splitting can be used to address data bias more directly. Oversampling involves increasing the number of instances from the minority class, while undersampling involves reducing the number of instances from the majority class. Stratified splitting involves dividing the data into subsets while preserving the original class distribution, which can help to ensure that each subset is representative of the overall population.

Diverse data collection is another technique that can be used to address data bias. By collecting data from a variety of sources and ensuring that the data is representative of the target population, it is possible to reduce the risk of bias and improve the generalizability of the model.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, it does mention data augmentation techniques that were used to compensate for class imbalance. Other techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, stratified splitting, and diverse data collection can also be used to address data bias during preprocessing.
