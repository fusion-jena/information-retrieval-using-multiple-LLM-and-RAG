The provided context does not give specific information about the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the data being analyzed is related to tracked vocalisations of song structures in animals. This implies that the data is likely in an audio format, but the context does not explicitly confirm this. Additionally, there is a table (Table 1) that shows the number of tracked vocalisations of each song structure as a proportion of the whole data set, which suggests that the data may be in a CSV format or similar structured data format. However, without further information, it is not possible to definitively determine the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.
