Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model, such as sampsize and ntree, were optimized. The text mentions that small values of sampsize were selected to improve computational performance, and large values of ntree were used to obtain models with stable classification results. It also mentions that the rfpermute package was used to summarize model results. However, it does not specify whether a grid search, random search, or any other optimization method was used to determine the values of these hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
