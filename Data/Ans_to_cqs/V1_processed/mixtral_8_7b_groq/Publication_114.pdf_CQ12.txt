The deep learning models used in the pipeline are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This is evident from the context, which mentions the use of AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet50. All of these models are variants of CNNs that have been widely used for image classification tasks. AlexNet was one of the first deep learning models to achieve significant success in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC), and VGG16 and ResNet50 are more recent models that have improved upon its performance. These models have been adapted for the specific task of tree species classification in the pipeline.
