The provided context discusses machine learning methods, specifically the use of a repeated nested k-fold cross-validation approach and random forest models for model development. However, it does not mention any regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization.

Deep learning models, which are a subset of machine learning methods, are prone to overfitting due to their complexity and large number of parameters. Regularization techniques are used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages the model from learning overly complex patterns in the training data that may not generalize well to new, unseen data.

Dropout is a regularization technique used in deep learning models that randomly sets a fraction of the input units to zero during training. This helps to prevent overfitting by reducing the co-adaptation of input units and promoting the learning of more robust features.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is another regularization technique used in deep learning models. It adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model weights. This encourages the model to learn smaller weights, which helps to prevent overfitting by reducing the complexity of the model.

While the provided context does not mention these regularization techniques, it is important to note that different machine learning methods may require different regularization techniques. Deep learning models, in particular, often require more sophisticated regularization techniques due to their complexity and large number of parameters.
