Addressing data bias is a crucial step in the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. Several techniques can be employed to mitigate data bias, including stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting is a method used to divide the dataset into training and testing sets while preserving the original dataset's class distribution. This technique ensures that each subset contains a representative proportion of each class, reducing the likelihood of bias in the training and testing sets.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to balance the dataset by either increasing the number of instances in the minority class or decreasing the number of instances in the majority class. Oversampling can be achieved by replicating instances from the minority class or generating synthetic data using techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). Undersampling can be achieved by randomly selecting instances from the majority class or using more sophisticated methods such as Tomek links.

Diverse data collection is another technique to address data bias. This involves collecting data from various sources, geographical locations, and demographic groups to ensure that the dataset is representative of the true variability of the population. This technique helps to reduce the risk of bias and improve the generalization ability of the model.

In the context of bird species classification, data augmentation techniques such as horizontal and vertical translations, shear distortion, and random shifts can be employed to increase the training dataset size and maintain balance. These techniques help to reduce overfitting and improve the generalization of deep learning models.

In the study by Sitepu et al. (2022), data augmentation was employed to address overfitting and improve the performance of pre-trained models for bird species classification. After augmentation, the training dataset size was increased from 11,788 to 40,000 images, resulting in a significant improvement in accuracy.

Therefore, it is crucial to consider the limitations and potential biases of the training dataset when interpreting the results and making inferences about real-world bird species recognition. Efforts should be made to collect more comprehensive and diverse datasets that better reflect the true variability of bird populations.
