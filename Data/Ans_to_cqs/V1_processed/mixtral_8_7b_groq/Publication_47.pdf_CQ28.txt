The provided context does not explicitly mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It only states that the deep neural network algorithm was implemented as an R package (IUCNN) based on the Python TensorFlow library. Therefore, I cannot determine whether AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform, or any other platform was used to deploy the model.
