The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, recall, and F1-Score. Accuracy is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of input samples. It represents the overall correctness of the model's predictions. Recall, also known as sensitivity, is the ratio of the number of true positive predictions (correctly predicted positive samples) to the total number of actual positive samples. It measures the model's ability to find all positive samples. The F1-Score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, which provides a balance between the two metrics. Precision is the ratio of the number of true positive predictions to the total number of positive predictions made by the model. It measures the model's accuracy in predicting positive samples.

In the provided context, the performance of the Autoencoder (AE), Elastic Kernel Sparse Autoencoder (ESK), and Stacked Autoencoder-Kernel Density Estimation (SK) models is evaluated using accuracy, recall, and F1-Score. The AE model has the shortest running time but shows the poorest classification results. The ESK model has a longer running time than the AE model but demonstrates improved accuracy, recall, and F1-Score by 8.44%, 8.77%, and 4.84%, respectively. The SK model also has a longer running time than the AE model, and its performance metrics are slightly lower than those of the ESK model.

Additionally, the Elastic Net method is used to improve the performance of the ESK model by addressing overfitting in small datasets and reducing training time for high-dimensional genetic data. The results show that the ESK model with Elastic Net significantly improves the classification performance on three datasets, with the accuracy, recall, and F1-Score reaching 97.57%, 97.43%, and 98.96% on average, respectively.

In summary, the performance of deep learning models for DNA barcode sequence classification is evaluated using accuracy, recall, and F1-Score metrics. The ESK model with Elastic Net shows the best performance, with an average accuracy, recall, and F1-Score of 97.57%, 97.43%, and 98.96%, respectively.
