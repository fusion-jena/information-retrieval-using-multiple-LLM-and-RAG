The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific evaluation metrics used for assessing the performance of a deep learning model, such as accuracy, precision, or recall. However, it does discuss several metrics that are relevant for evaluating species distribution models (SDMs), which can include deep learning models.

The context highlights the use of metrics such as AUC' (Area Under the Curve of the Receiver Operating Characteristic), maxTSS (True Skill Statistics), and CBI (Cohen's Kappa) for quantitatively comparing and ranking model performances. These metrics are commonly used for evaluating SDMs, and they provide a measure of the model's ability to discriminate between presences and absences of a species.

Furthermore, the context emphasizes the importance of checking other model outputs, such as response curves and mapped predictions, in addition to these quantitative metrics. Response curves can provide insights into the relationship between the response variable (e.g., species presence) and the predictor variables (covariates), while mapped predictions can be used to visualize the spatial distribution of the species.

When it comes to the covariate selection process, the context suggests evaluating other important steps that can influence the predictions, including the complexity and tuning of model parameters. This is because the choice of covariates can significantly impact the performance of SDMs, and careful consideration should be given to selecting the most relevant and informative covariates.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the evaluation metrics used for deep learning models, it does discuss several relevant metrics and evaluation methods for SDMs. These include AUC', maxTSS, CBI, response curves, and mapped predictions. Additionally, the context highlights the importance of carefully evaluating the covariate selection process and model parameters when assessing the performance of SDMs.
