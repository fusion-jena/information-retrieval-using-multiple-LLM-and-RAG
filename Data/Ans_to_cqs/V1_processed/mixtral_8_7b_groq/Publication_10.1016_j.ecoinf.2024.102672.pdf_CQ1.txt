The provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the data used in the study were supervised by the CHE before their publication, and that some of the data were obtained from the SAICA and the SAIH. This suggests that the data may have been collected by the CHE, SAICA, and SAIH, possibly through the use of sensors or monitoring systems. Additionally, the use of open source libraries and frameworks for the Python 3 programming language, as well as the pre-processing of the data, suggests that the data may have been in a digital format prior to its use in the study. Beyond this, the context does not provide enough information to give a more specific answer.
