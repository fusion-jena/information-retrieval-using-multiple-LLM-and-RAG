The text provided does not give a detailed explanation of the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does offer some insights that can help us outline the general steps that were likely taken.

First, the model was trained using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in Theano and Lasagne. The input to the network was a 32 × 21 × 4 tensor, which was the result of preprocessing audio files with librosa. The specifics of this preprocessing are not provided, but it probably involved steps such as segmenting the audio files into shorter clips, extracting features (like spectrograms), and normalizing these features.

After training, the model's parameters were optimized to improve classification performance. The next step would typically be to serialize the model, i.e., to save its architecture and learned parameters to a file. This allows the model to be loaded and used for making predictions on new data, without having to retrain the entire network.

As for the platform selection, the text does not offer any direct information. However, it does mention that the ML pipeline was written in Python 2.7.12, and that the code is available in a GitHub repository. This suggests that the model was likely deployed on a computer system with Python installed, and that it could be run on any platform that supports Python.

In summary, while the text does not provide a detailed description of the process used to deploy the trained deep learning model, we can infer that it probably involved the following steps:

1. Serializing the trained model (saving its architecture and parameters to a file).
2. Selecting a platform with Python support (given that the code was written in Python).
3. Loading the serialized model and using it to make predictions on new data.
