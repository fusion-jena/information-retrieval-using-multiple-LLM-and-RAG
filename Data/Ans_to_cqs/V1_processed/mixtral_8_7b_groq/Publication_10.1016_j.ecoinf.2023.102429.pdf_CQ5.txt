The provided context does not contain information about the deep learning pipeline or the datasets used, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it focuses on various methods and techniques used in ecological informatics for soil nutrient estimation.

The context includes several studies and methods related to soil nutrient estimation using various techniques, such as partial least-squares regression (PLSR), continuum removal (CR), random forest (RF), and convolutional neural networks (CNN). These methods are applied to different spectral data for estimating soil nutrient concentrations.

For instance, one study (Bai et al., 2022) focuses on estimating soil organic carbon using Vis-NIR spectral data and spectral feature bands selection in southern Xinjiang, China. Another study (Attri et al., 2023) reviews deep learning techniques used in agriculture. However, neither of these studies mentions the deep learning pipelines or datasets used.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query regarding the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
