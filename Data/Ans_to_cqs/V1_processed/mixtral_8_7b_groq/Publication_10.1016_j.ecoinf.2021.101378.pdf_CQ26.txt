The provided context discusses the use of machine learning techniques, including random forest (RF) and maximum entropy modeling (Maxent), to model the potential distribution of pine wilt disease (PWD) under current and future climate scenarios. However, it does not directly address the query about techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.

In general, techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline include:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on certain criteria (e.g., class labels) and then randomly sampling from each subgroup to ensure that each subset of the data is representative of the whole.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of instances of the minority class in the dataset to balance it with the majority class.
3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class in the dataset to balance it with the minority class.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from a variety of sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population being modeled.

While the provided context does not specifically mention these techniques in the context of deep learning and data bias, it does highlight the importance of considering the potential for bias in ecological data and the use of machine learning techniques to manage complex and nonlinear ecological data.

In the study by Iordache et al. (2020), for example, the authors used a machine learning approach to detect PWD using airborne spectral imagery. They noted that the distribution of PWD is not uniform and that there may be spatial bias in the data. To address this, they used a combination of random forest and maximum entropy modeling to improve the accuracy of their predictions.

In the study by Lee et al. (2021), the authors developed an ensemble model by integrating the RF and Maxent models to improve the power of prediction for PWD occurrence. They noted that each model acted in a complementary manner and generated better results, suggesting that the ensemble approach helped to reduce bias and improve the accuracy of their predictions.

Overall, while the provided context does not directly address the query about techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, it highlights the importance of considering the potential for bias in ecological data and the use of machine learning techniques to manage complex and nonlinear ecological data. Techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection may be useful in addressing data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline.
