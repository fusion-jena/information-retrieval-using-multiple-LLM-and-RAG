The performance of the deep learning model in the study is evaluated using several statistical metrics. These metrics include the Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE), Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and correlation coefficient (R). The MAPE measures the average magnitude of the errors in percentage terms, while the MSE and RMSE quantify the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values. The correlation coefficient (R) measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between the predicted and actual values. However, the query asks about accuracy, precision, and recall, which are commonly used evaluation metrics in classification problems. In this study, the deep learning model is used for regression tasks, so accuracy, precision, and recall are not directly applicable. Nonetheless, the chosen metrics provide insights into the accuracy and predictive capability of the model by measuring the deviation between the predicted and actual observed values.
