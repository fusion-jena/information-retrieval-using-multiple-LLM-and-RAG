The provided context does not directly discuss the deep learning pipeline or specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. The text focuses on feature selection techniques and model evaluation for logistic regression and random forest models in the context of elephant habitat suitability analysis.

However, it is important to note that the concept of overfitting and regularization is not exclusive to deep learning. In the text, the authors discuss overfitting in the context of logistic regression models, where MLE and Bayesian logistic regression models showed signs of underfitting and overshooting actual observed frequencies. To address this, the authors restricted the non-linearity of the models and adjusted the priors and basis dimension, but the results still showed overly optimistic predictions.

In general, for deep learning pipelines, regularization methods like dropout, L2 regularization, and others are used to prevent overfitting. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to make the model more robust and less prone to overfitting. L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages large weights and helps to reduce overfitting.
