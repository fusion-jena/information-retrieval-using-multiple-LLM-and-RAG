The provided context discusses hyperparameter optimization in machine learning models, specifically for regression tasks using XGBoost and LightGBM. It includes a range of hyperparameters that can be tuned to optimize model performance, such as learning rate, maximum tree depth, and regularization parameters. However, the context does not directly mention regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization.

In deep learning, overfitting can be a significant issue, and various regularization techniques are employed to prevent this. Dropout is a regularization technique used in neural networks where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, preventing over-reliance on specific neurons and thus reducing overfitting. L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function, which is proportional to the square of the model's weights. This encourages smaller weights, reducing the complexity of the model and preventing overfitting.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention these regularization techniques, it is essential to note that hyperparameter optimization is a critical step in deep learning pipelines, just as it is in machine learning models. Regularization parameters, such as L1 and L2 regularization, can be tuned during hyperparameter optimization to find the optimal balance between model complexity and generalization.

Therefore, while the provided context does not directly answer the query, it is still relevant in the broader context of hyperparameter optimization and regularization techniques used in machine learning and deep learning pipelines.
