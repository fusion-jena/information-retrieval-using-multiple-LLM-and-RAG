The context provided does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It is mentioned that the fast.ai platform was used for training and validating models, but it does not specify if GPUs, TPUs, or any other specific hardware were used. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
