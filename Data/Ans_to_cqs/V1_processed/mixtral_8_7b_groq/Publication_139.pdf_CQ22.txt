The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, weighted accuracy, F1-scores, and recall. 

The accuracy is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions. The average unweighted and weighted accuracies for the training data are 98.9% and 97.4%, respectively, while for the test data, the average unweighted and weighted accuracies are 94.7% and 88.8%, respectively.

The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, where precision is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total positive predictions, and recall is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives. The F1-scores for the training and testing datasets are 0.980 and 0.907, respectively.

Recall scores are also reported for the validation dataset, which measures the proportion of actual positives that were correctly identified. The network performance on all six validation days has an average recall score of 84.9%.

Additionally, the area under the curve, as computed by a Riemann sum, is used for training the model. Early stopping is also employed to prevent overfitting, where training ceases when the model's performance on a validation set stops improving.

It is worth noting that slightly lower testing accuracy scores are seen in categories like background noise and smaller classes with fewer training examples. Pre-training on ResNet50 and Inception neural networks did not meaningfully improve classification performance, and a simpler architecture was used instead.
