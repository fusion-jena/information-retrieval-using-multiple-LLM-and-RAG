The provided context does not mention any measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The models that were used include linear regression, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Light Gradient Boosting. These are all machine learning models, and no deep learning models are mentioned.

Moreover, the context provides details about the hyperparameters tuning, cross-validation strategy, and data preprocessing for the machine learning models. However, there is no information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model.

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot provide an answer to the query regarding the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
