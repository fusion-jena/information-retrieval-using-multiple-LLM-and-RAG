The text provided does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the deep learning model in terms of accuracy, precision, or recall. However, it does mention two metrics commonly used to evaluate object-tracking algorithms, which can provide insights into the performance of the model.

The two metrics mentioned are precision and success plots. The precision plot evaluates the center location error of the tracking algorithm. It measures the average Euclidean distance between the centroid locations of the tracked targets and the manually labeled ground truths. In other words, it assesses how close the predicted object location is to its actual location in the video frames. A higher precision plot indicates a more accurate center location.

The success plot, on the other hand, is not explicitly defined in the text. However, based on the context, it likely evaluates the model's ability to maintain a consistent track of the object throughout the video frames. It might measure the percentage of video frames where the tracked object overlaps with the manually labeled ground truth by a certain threshold. A higher success plot would indicate better performance in maintaining a consistent track of the object.

While these two metrics provide insights into the model's performance in tracking objects, they do not directly correspond to the traditional machine learning metrics of accuracy, precision, or recall. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of total predictions, while precision measures the proportion of true positives among all positive predictions. Recall, on the other hand, measures the proportion of true positives among all actual positives.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is unclear what accuracy, precision, or recall metrics are used to evaluate the deep learning model.
