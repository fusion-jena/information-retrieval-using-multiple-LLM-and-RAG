The deep learning models mentioned in the provided context are used for image object detection and segmentation. Specifically, the models are used for the segmentation of objects in unmanned aerial systems (UAS) imagery and airborne lidar data.

In the study by Liu and Abd-Elrahman (2018), a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model is used for the training enrichment of wetlands classification in UAS imagery. The model is used to classify different types of wetlands in the imagery.

In the study by Marasigan et al. (2019), a marker-controlled watershed (MCWS) algorithm, which is a type of region-based segmentation method, is used for mangrove crown diameter measurement from airborne lidar data.

In the study by Martins et al. (2021), a machine learning model along with SLIC (Simple Linear Iterative Clustering) is used for tree canopies segmentation in urban areas. The model is used to segment tree canopies from urban areas using high-resolution satellite imagery.

In the study by Chen et al. (2021), a PointNet model, which is a type of deep learning model, is used for individual tree crown segmentation directly from UAV-borne LiDAR data.

In the study by Do et al. (2022), a bird's eye view (BEV) Faster region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) algorithm is used for the segmentation of objects in LiDAR data. The model is used to segment objects in low, medium, and high-density LiDAR data.

In summary, the deep learning models mentioned in the provided context are used for the segmentation of objects in UAS imagery and airborne lidar data. These models are used to classify wetlands, measure mangrove crown diameter, segment tree canopies in urban areas, segment individual tree crowns, and segment objects in LiDAR data.
