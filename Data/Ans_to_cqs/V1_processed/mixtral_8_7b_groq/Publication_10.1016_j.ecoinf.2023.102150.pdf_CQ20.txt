The deep learning model was trained using a cloud service provided by Sigma2 - the National Infrastructure for High Performance Computing and Data Storage in Norway. The specific hardware resources used for training the model include 1 GPU, 4 CPUs, and 16 GB of RAM.

The GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is a specialized electronic circuit designed to rapidly manipulate and analyze visual information. GPUs are particularly well-suited for machine learning tasks, as they can perform many calculations simultaneously, making them much faster than traditional CPUs for certain types of computations.

In this case, the GPU was used in conjunction with the keras package in R, which is an interface to TensorFlow, a popular open-source machine learning platform. TensorFlow is designed to take advantage of GPU acceleration, making it an ideal choice for training deep learning models.

The use of a GPU for training the model would have allowed the researchers to perform computations much more quickly than if they had used a CPU alone. This is particularly important when training deep learning models, which can require a significant amount of computational resources.

In addition to the GPU, the model was also trained using 4 CPUs (Central Processing Units) and 16 GB of RAM. CPUs are the primary components of a computer that perform most of the processing inside the computer. They are responsible for executing a sequence of stored instructions called a program.

The use of multiple CPUs would have allowed the researchers to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, further speeding up the training process. The 16 GB of RAM would have provided enough memory to store the model architecture, training data, and other relevant information during the training process.

Overall, the use of a GPU, multiple CPUs, and 16 GB of RAM would have allowed the researchers to train their deep learning model efficiently and effectively, enabling them to analyze large image data sets and make accurate predictions about the presence of different animal species in camera trap images.
