Based on the provided context, the deep learning models described, such as LeNet, AlexNet, and GoogLeNet, do not explicitly mention the use of specific data annotation techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. These models primarily focus on image classification tasks, and the context mainly discusses the architecture details, layer configurations, and training procedures of these models.

However, it is important to note that data annotation techniques are a crucial part of the deep learning pipeline, particularly for tasks involving computer vision. Here are some common data annotation techniques:

1. Image-level classification: This is the simplest form of annotation, where an image is assigned to a single class or category. The models discussed in the context, such as LeNet, AlexNet, and GoogLeNet, use this annotation technique for image classification tasks.

2. Bounding box annotation: In this technique, a bounding box is drawn around an object of interest in an image. This annotation helps the model to learn the spatial location and size of the object. Object detection models, such as Faster R-CNN, SSD, or YOLO, use bounding box annotations for training.

3. Semantic segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image with a corresponding class or category. Semantic segmentation helps the model to understand the spatial layout of objects within an image. Models like U-Net, FCN, or DeepLab use semantic segmentation annotations for training.

4. Instance segmentation: Instance segmentation combines object detection and semantic segmentation. It not only classifies each pixel but also distinguishes between individual instances of an object in an image. Instance segmentation models, such as Mask R-CNN, can identify and segment multiple objects within a single image.

In summary, the provided context discusses deep learning models for image classification tasks but does not explicitly mention specific data annotation techniques. However, data annotation techniques like image-level classification, bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation are essential for training deep learning models in various computer vision tasks.
