Based on the provided context, there are specific metrics calculated after model training, namely the coefficients of determination (R2) and the root mean squared error (RMSE). However, there is no explicit mention of other postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrices.

The R2 score measures the percentage of variation in the response variable explained by the model, while the RMSE provides an understanding of the difference between the actual and predicted values. Both these metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the models in this context.

Additionally, the overfitting of the models is assessed by comparing the model performance on the training, validation, and test datasets. This comparison helps to ensure that the models are not excessively fitting to the training data and can generalize well to unseen data.

It is also worth noting that the practical applicability of the models is constrained, and when labeled data is available in the targeted regions, it is generally more prudent to incorporate it into the model calibration and testing processes.

Therefore, based on the given context, the postprocessing steps primarily involve the calculation of R2 and RMSE metrics, with no explicit mention of saliency maps or confusion matrices.
