Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study of species and sex identification of rare forest carnivores. The text focuses on the development of a non-invasive method for species and sex identification using footprint identification technology and does not mention any code repository or provide a link to one. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
