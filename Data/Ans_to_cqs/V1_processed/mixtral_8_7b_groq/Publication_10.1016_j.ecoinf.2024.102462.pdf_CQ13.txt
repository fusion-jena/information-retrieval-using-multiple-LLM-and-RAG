The provided context discusses the use of deep learning (DL) models, specifically ResNet, for image classification. However, it does not give explicit information about the specific hyperparameters used in the DL model.

Hyperparameters are configuration variables that are set before the learning process begins. They determine the structure of the model and the learning algorithm. Some common hyperparameters include the learning rate, the type of optimizer, the number of layers or nodes in the model, and the type of regularization.

In the context, it is mentioned that the DL networks are trained using annotated data, and the parameters of the model are adjusted following an optimization process. The ResNet model is mentioned as a specific architecture that uses residual connections. However, the specific hyperparameters used in this process are not provided.

Therefore, we cannot provide a specific answer to the query based on the given context. However, it is important to note that the choice of hyperparameters can significantly affect the performance of the DL model. Therefore, it is a common practice to perform a hyperparameter tuning or optimization to find the best set of hyperparameters for a given problem.
