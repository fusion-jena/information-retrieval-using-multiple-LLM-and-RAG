Based on the information provided, there is no mention of a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline's data is available, such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. The context focuses on the methodology, process, and results of the study, but it does not include any details about the data repository.

The data used in this study seems to have been prepared and processed specifically for this research, as described in the "Spectral segmentation and band selection" section. It involves extracting training samples from eight categories of ground truth images, but there is no information on where these images originated from or how to access them.

It is possible that the data is not publicly available due to privacy, copyright, or other restrictions. If you are interested in obtaining the data, it might be worth reaching out to the authors of the study directly to inquire about the possibility of accessing the data.

In summary, I cannot provide a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline's data is available based on the given context.
