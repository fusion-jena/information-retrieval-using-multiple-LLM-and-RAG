The provided pieces of context do not give specific information about the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, they do mention the creation of a custom dataset for a deep learning project and the use of data augmentation in the context of TensorFlow convolutional neural network performance.

Data augmentation is a technique that can help to increase the size and diversity of a dataset by artificially expanding it through various transformations such as rotation, scaling, and flipping of the existing images. This can help to reduce overfitting and improve the generalization of the model.

Additionally, the authors mention the use of the Adam learning rate optimizer, which is an adaptive learning rate algorithm that can help to improve model accuracy. Adaptive learning rate algorithms can be useful in addressing data bias by adjusting the learning rate during training to better match the distribution of the data.

In the context of the project described, the authors created their own dataset due to the lack of existing quality data. This dataset was relatively small, but testing the model under difficult circumstances and complex backgrounds still yielded good detection capabilities. This suggests that the authors may have used techniques such as data augmentation and adaptive learning rate algorithms to help address data bias and improve the performance of their model.

In summary, while the provided pieces of context do not explicitly mention techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, they do suggest the use of data augmentation and adaptive learning rate algorithms as methods to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
