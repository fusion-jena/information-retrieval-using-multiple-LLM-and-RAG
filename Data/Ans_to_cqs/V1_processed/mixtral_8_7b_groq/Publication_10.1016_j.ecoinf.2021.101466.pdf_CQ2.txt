The deep learning pipeline described in the given context uses image data as the input format. The primary goal of the pipeline is to train an EfficientNet model for insect detection using a dataset of insect images. These images were used for both training and validation, with 80% of the 4000 images per category used for training and the remaining 20% used for validation.

To augment the dataset and improve model performance, the authors combined masked foreground images of insects with background images that did not contain any insects. This data augmentation process was applied to the training dataset only, and the resulting images underwent the same image processing as the data augmentation for YOLOv4.

It is important to note that the pipeline does not mention the use of other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV files. The entire focus of the deep learning pipeline is on image-based insect detection using the EfficientNet model.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline described in the given context uses image data as the primary input format. The pipeline involves preparing a dataset of insect images, augmenting the dataset through compositing, and training an EfficientNet model for insect detection using the augmented dataset. Other data formats, such as audio, video, or CSV files, are not mentioned in the context.
