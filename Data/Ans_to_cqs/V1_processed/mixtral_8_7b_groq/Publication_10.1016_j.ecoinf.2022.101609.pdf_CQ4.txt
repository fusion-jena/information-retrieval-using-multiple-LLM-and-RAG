Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context includes information about a deep learning framework for highway air quality monitoring and prediction, as well as a study on the evaluation and calibration of a low-cost particle sensor using machine-learning methods. However, neither of these sources mention any data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling.

Data augmentation is a common technique used in deep learning to increase the size of the training set and improve the model's ability to generalize. Some common data augmentation techniques for image data include flipping, rotating, and scaling. Flipping involves creating new training examples by horizontally or vertically flipping the original images. Rotating involves creating new training examples by rotating the original images by a certain angle. Scaling involves creating new training examples by changing the size of the original images.

It's possible that data augmentation techniques were used in the deep learning pipeline for the highway air quality monitoring and prediction framework, but this information is not provided in the context. Additionally, it's possible that data augmentation was not used in the study on the evaluation and calibration of a low-cost particle sensor, as the focus of that study was on the sensor's performance and not on the deep learning pipeline.

In summary, based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. It's possible that data augmentation was used but not mentioned, or it's possible that it was not used at all.
