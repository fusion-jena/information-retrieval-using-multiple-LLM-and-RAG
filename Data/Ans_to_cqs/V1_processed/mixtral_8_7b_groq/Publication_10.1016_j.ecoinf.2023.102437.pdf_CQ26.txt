The provided context discusses various aspects of machine learning models, particularly in the context of environmental science and time series data, but it does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does touch upon some related concepts that are often used in addressing data bias, such as diverse data collection and the use of ensemble learning in Random Forest models.

Ensemble learning, as mentioned in the context, is a technique where multiple models are created and their predictions are aggregated to produce a final output. In the case of Random Forest models, this is done through the aggregation of tree structures or trees created during the learning phase. This can help reduce bias, as the final prediction is based on the collective wisdom of multiple models, rather than a single one.

The context also mentions the use of the signature method in machine learning, which is a way to characterize laws of stochastic processes. While this method is not directly related to data bias, it does highlight the importance of considering historical data in predictive models, which can help ensure that the model is not biased towards recent data points.

In terms of preprocessing techniques specifically mentioned in the context, stratified splitting is used to ensure that the train and test sets have similar distributions of the target variable. This can help reduce bias, as it ensures that the model is not being trained or tested on data that is not representative of the overall population.

However, the context does not mention other common preprocessing techniques used to address data bias, such as oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to balance classes in imbalanced datasets, while diverse data collection refers to the practice of collecting data from a wide variety of sources to ensure that the dataset is representative of the overall population.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, it does touch upon related concepts such as ensemble learning and stratified splitting. Other preprocessing techniques commonly used to address data bias, such as oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, are not mentioned in the context.
