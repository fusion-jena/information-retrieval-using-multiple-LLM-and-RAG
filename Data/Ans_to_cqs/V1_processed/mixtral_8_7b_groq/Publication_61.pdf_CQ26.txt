The provided context discusses the training of a neural network for cactus recognition, including data augmentation techniques used during training to improve accuracy. However, it does not explicitly mention the strategies used to address data bias during the preprocessing stage of the deep learning pipeline.

In the context, data augmentation techniques include resizing patches to 32 Ã— 32 and normalization. Additionally, vertical and horizontal flips are applied to the patches with a probability of 0.5, as independent events. These techniques increase the amount of training data and help the model generalize better, reducing overfitting. However, they do not directly address data bias.

In general, techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Stratified splitting: This method involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on specific criteria (e.g., class labels) and then randomly splitting each subgroup to maintain the original distribution in both training and testing sets.
2. Oversampling: In cases where certain classes are underrepresented, oversampling can be used to increase the number of instances from these classes. This can be done by replicating existing instances or generating synthetic data using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
3. Undersampling: When some classes have a significantly larger number of instances than others, undersampling can be used to balance the dataset by reducing the number of instances from the majority class. However, this method may result in loss of valuable information.
4. Diverse data collection: Collecting data from various sources, locations, and conditions can help ensure that the dataset is representative and less biased. This can include collecting data during different times of the day, under different weather conditions, or from different devices.

Based on the provided context, it is unclear which of these techniques, if any, were used to address data bias during preprocessing.
