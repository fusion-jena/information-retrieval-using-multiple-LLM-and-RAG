The text preprocessing and machine learning pipeline described in the context do not specify a particular deep learning model such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. However, it does mention the use of the ERNIE model, which is a type of transformer model. The ERNIE model was used for a mixed-language emotional analysis task at the International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation 2020 and has shown significant results in previous studies. The ERNIE model directly models prior semantic knowledge units, thereby enhancing model semantic representation. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a transformer-based model, specifically the ERNIE model.
