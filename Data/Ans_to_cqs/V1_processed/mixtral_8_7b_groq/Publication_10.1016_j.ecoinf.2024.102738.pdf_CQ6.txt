The provided context does not directly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does discuss some data preparation and sampling techniques that are often part of the preprocessing pipeline.

In the context of remote sensing data, preprocessing can include various steps such as noise reduction, normalization, scaling, and feature extraction. 

1. Noise Reduction: This step is crucial as it helps to eliminate unwanted signals or interferences that can affect the accuracy of the model. Techniques such as smoothing filters or atmospheric corrections can be used.

2. Normalization/Scaling: These techniques are used to adjust the range of pixel values to a common scale, which can help improve the model's performance. For instance, the formula for NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) involves dividing the difference of Near-Infrared (NIR) and Red bands by their sum. This normalization process ensures that the index values range between -1 and 1, regardless of the original reflectance values.

3. Feature Extraction: This involves deriving new features or indices from the original spectral bands. The context provides several examples, such as NDVI, EVI, SAVI, BSI, MNDWI, and NDMI. These indices capture specific characteristics of the land cover, such as vegetation health, water content, or built-up areas.

4. Cleaning: This step involves removing anomalies or outliers that may exist in the data. The context mentions the use of "pure training areas" which should contain at least 50 pixels in total and prominently represent the class of interest. This could be seen as a form of data cleaning.

5. Sampling: The context discusses the use of simplified random sampling for distributing training areas. This is a strategy to effectively capture variability within each class and improve the classification.

While the context does not explicitly mention deep learning models, the preprocessing steps discussed here are generally applicable to training any machine learning model, including deep learning models.
