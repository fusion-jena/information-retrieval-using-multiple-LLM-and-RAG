Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the generalizability measures taken for a deep learning model. However, the text describes the methodology for a random forest (RF) classification model, which includes measures to ensure model performance.

To ensure the model performance of the RF approach, the number of trees (ntree) and number of features in each split (mtry) were allowed to be set by the model by default. This resulted in approximately 500 decision trees and over 3000 training samples randomly selected for training purposes under default settings.

Additionally, the text provides classification accuracy measures for the RF model, including overall accuracy, 95% confidence interval (CI), kappa statistics, and p-value. These measures are used to assess the performance of the RF model.

However, the context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, based on the provided information, it is not possible to answer this query.
