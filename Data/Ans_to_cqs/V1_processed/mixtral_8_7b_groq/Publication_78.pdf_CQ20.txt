The provided context does not give information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. The models mentioned include AlexNet, ResNet-50, VGG-19, GoogleNet, and Inceptionv3, as well as a custom D-CNN named CoralNet. The training parameters for CoralNet are provided, including the optimizer (Adam), number of epochs (10), and loss function (Cross Entropy), but there is no mention of the hardware used for training. Additionally, the SVM classifier used for comparison is not associated with any specific hardware. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
