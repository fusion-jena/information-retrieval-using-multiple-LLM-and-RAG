The deep learning models mentioned in the article are used for object detection in the context of Arctic wildlife monitoring. Specifically, two separate two-class models were trained for Finnmark and Yamal using the ResNet-50 architecture, a type of convolutional neural network that is 50 layers deep. These models are used to detect and classify objects in time-lapse camera images as either present or not present in the image.

Additionally, the approach described in the article also utilizes the MegaDetector model, which is a highly performant openly available model for object detection. The purpose of using MegaDetector is to classify objects in images as either rocks, bait, empty, or belonging to a specific species. This model is used in conjunction with the custom site-specific models to improve the accuracy and efficiency of object detection in Arctic wildlife monitoring.

In summary, the deep learning models mentioned in the article serve the purpose of object detection in time-lapse camera images for Arctic wildlife monitoring. These models are used to classify objects as either present or not present in the image, and to identify the type of object in the image.
