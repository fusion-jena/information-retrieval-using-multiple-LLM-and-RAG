I am unable to provide the exact data repository link for the deep learning pipeline as none of the provided sources include this information. However, I can suggest some possible repositories where the data might be located based on common practices in the field.

One possible repository for the data could be Zenodo (<https://zenodo.org/>), which is a research data repository that allows researchers to deposit and share their data. It is an open-access platform that assigns digital object identifiers (DOIs) to datasets, making them citable and traceable.

Another possible repository is Figshare (<https://figshare.com/>), which is a repository for all types of research outputs, including datasets, figures, and papers. It allows researchers to share their data and make them publicly available, and it also provides DOIs for datasets.

Dryad (<https://datadryad.org/>) is another repository that focuses on data from the sciences, including biology, ecology, and environmental sciences. It provides a platform for researchers to share their data and make them publicly available, and it also assigns DOIs to datasets.

Finally, the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) (<https://www.gbif.org/>) is a repository that focuses on biodiversity data, including occurrence records, species checklists, and molecular data. It provides a platform for researchers to share their data and make them publicly available, and it also assigns DOIs to datasets.

Given that the provided context includes research on computer vision and image segmentation, it is possible that the data repository may be related to image datasets. However, without more specific information, it is difficult to determine the exact repository where the data might be located.
