Based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated. However, it is mentioned that deep learning algorithms have been developed to break the limitation of traditional neural networks on the number of layers. This allows for the extraction of deeply hidden characteristic information and features from large-scale data, beyond what was previously imaginable.

In the paper mentioned, the comparison between the BPNN (Backpropagation Neural Network) model and the SVM (Support Vector Machine) model is conducted to seek a more suitable prediction model for the EF (Ecological Footprint) by taking advantage of both. While BPNN is a type of neural network model, SVM is not. SVM is a type of machine learning model that can be used for classification, regression, and outliers detection. However, the paper does not specify the purpose of the deep learning model in this context.

Furthermore, the papers and articles mentioned in the context use deep learning models for various purposes, such as predicting the distribution of invasive trees, predicting groundwater remediation costs, estimating daily global solar radiation, capturing heterogeneity and PLS-sem, and predicting mosquito abundances in urban areas. However, these are specific applications of deep learning models and do not represent the general purpose of deep learning models.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific purpose of the deep learning model. It can be used for various purposes, such as classification, segmentation, detection, and prediction, depending on the specific application and problem at hand.
