The provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the feasibility of using small datasets to train deep learning models and provides details about the training of a specific convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, AlexNet. However, it does not mention where the dataset used for training can be accessed.

The context refers to a study that uses a small-size dataset to train deep learning models, specifically the MG and MO models. It states that the models perform well in their own validation set, indicating that the dataset was likely chosen and prepared specifically for this study. Therefore, it is unlikely that the dataset is publicly available in a data repository like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.

The context also provides details about the training of the AlexNet architecture on the ImageNet dataset. The ImageNet dataset is a large-scale dataset used for object recognition and image classification tasks. It contains over 14 million images belonging to 1000 classes. The dataset is publicly available and can be accessed through the ImageNet website. However, the context does not mention whether the specific subset of the dataset used for training AlexNet is available in a data repository.

In summary, the provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the training of deep learning models on a small-size dataset and the AlexNet architecture on the ImageNet dataset, but it does not mention where the datasets can be accessed.
