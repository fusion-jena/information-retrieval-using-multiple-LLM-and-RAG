Based on the provided context, the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline include images and CSV files. The main focus of the context is on visual recognition tasks, and images are the primary data format used. For instance, Khalajzadeh et al. (2014) used a convolutional neural network for face recognition with images as input. Additionally, He et al. (2016) presented a deep residual learning method for image recognition. The works of Bhagabati and Sarma (2016), Arshad (2021), and Taskiran et al. (2020) also involve object detection and recognition tasks using images.

Moreover, CSV files are mentioned in the context as a data format for custom training. Specifically, the model's performance is evaluated using mAP values, which are calculated based on the training summary presented in Tables 5, 6, and 7 for epochs 100, 200, and 250, respectively. These tables contain performance metrics, likely stored in CSV format for easier processing and analysis.

There is no explicit mention of audio or video data formats in the provided context. However, it is important to note that deep learning pipelines can handle various data formats, including images, audio, video, and CSV files, depending on the specific task and application.

In summary, the provided context primarily focuses on visual recognition tasks using image data formats. However, CSV files are also mentioned as a data format for storing performance metrics. Deep learning pipelines can generally handle various data formats, including images, audio, video, and CSV files.
