Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. However, the context does mention the use of image processing on sample plots to generate a tabulated dataset, which includes aboveground biomass (AGB) and independent features. It can be inferred that some form of image annotation or processing was used to extract these features from the sample plots.

In general, there are various data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines for computer vision tasks, such as:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest in an image. It is useful for object detection tasks where the goal is to locate and classify objects within an image.

2. Instance segmentation: This technique involves creating a mask for each object instance in an image, separating it from the background and other object instances. It is useful for tasks that require pixel-level accuracy, such as semantic segmentation or object segmentation.

3. Semantic segmentation: This technique involves classifying each pixel in an image into a specific class or category. It is useful for tasks that require understanding the composition of an image, such as scene understanding or image classification.

4. Landmark annotation: This technique involves identifying and marking key points or landmarks on objects within an image. It is useful for tasks that require understanding the spatial relationships between objects or their parts, such as facial recognition or pose estimation.

5. Scribble annotation: This technique involves drawing free-form scribbles or strokes over objects of interest in an image. It is useful for weakly supervised learning tasks where a large amount of annotated data is not available.

Without more specific information from the provided context, it is difficult to determine which of these techniques were used in the described study. However, it is clear that some form of image annotation or processing was employed to generate the tabulated dataset used in the study.
