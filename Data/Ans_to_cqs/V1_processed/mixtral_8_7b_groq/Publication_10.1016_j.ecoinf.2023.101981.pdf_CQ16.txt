Based on the provided context, there is no information given about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete in the Kaleidoscope software. The text focuses on the use of the software for detecting cow calls and the process of setting parameters for the software, but it does not mention any details about the training process or how to know when it has been completed.

In general, when training a machine learning model, there are several common criteria that are used to determine when training is complete. One common method is to monitor the validation loss and stop training when the loss plateaus or begins to increase, indicating that the model is overfitting to the training data. Another method is to set a maximum number of training epochs, after which training will automatically stop. Additionally, early stopping can be used, which stops training when the validation loss does not improve for a certain number of epochs.

Without more information about the specific training process used in Kaleidoscope, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this query. However, it is likely that one or more of these common criteria are used to determine when training is complete in the software.
