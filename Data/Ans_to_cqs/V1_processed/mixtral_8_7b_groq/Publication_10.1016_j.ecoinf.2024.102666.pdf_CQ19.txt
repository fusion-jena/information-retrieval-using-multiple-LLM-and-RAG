Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about which specific deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, are used for building the models. However, it does mention the use of artificial neural networks (ANN) for processing sensor data from satellites. Both TensorFlow and PyTorch are popular open-source frameworks for building and training ANN models. Given the prominence of these frameworks in the field of deep learning, it is plausible that one or both of these could have been used in the studies mentioned.

The context focuses on the application of these models to analyze remote sensing data for aquatic environments. Specifically, it highlights the use of the Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes (FLAASH) model for atmospheric correction (AC) of Sentinel-2, SPOT-6, and ALOS AVNIR-2 data. While FLAASH is not a deep learning framework per se, it is a preprocessing step often used in conjunction with deep learning techniques.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly state which deep learning frameworks are used, it is likely that TensorFlow, PyTorch, or another popular framework was used given their widespread use in the field of deep learning.
