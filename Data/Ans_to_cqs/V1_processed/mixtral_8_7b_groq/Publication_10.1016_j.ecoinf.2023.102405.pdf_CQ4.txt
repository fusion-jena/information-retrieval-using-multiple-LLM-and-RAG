Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling being applied in the described deep learning pipeline. The text focuses primarily on data pre-processing steps like data cleaning and the architecture of an Attention-based One-Dimensional Encoder-Decoder GRU (AODEGRU) model for aquaculture water quality analysis.

Data pre-processing is explained in detail, which includes initializing the model, defining the loss function and optimizer, training the model, and calculating training loss and accuracy. However, data augmentation techniques are not mentioned in this context.

Data augmentation is a common technique used to increase the size and diversity of datasets, especially when the original dataset is small. Common data augmentation techniques for image data include flipping, rotating, and scaling. For time series data, like the water quality data in this study, data augmentation techniques may include adding noise, jittering, windowing, or time-warping.

In summary, while the text provides valuable information about data pre-processing and the AODEGRU model, it does not explicitly mention data augmentation techniques. Therefore, it is not possible to answer this query without additional context.
