Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss data pre-processing methods that are recommended for Qflow data due to the non-linear correlations between associated variables. These methods include combining data pre-processing techniques with ML models at a prior stage of the learning process, which increases the modeling capability of a standalone prediction model used for Qflow modeling.

While not specifically mentioned in the context, some common techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline include:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the data into subgroups based on specific criteria, and then splitting the data while preserving the percentage of samples for each subgroup. This can help ensure that each subset of the data is representative of the overall data.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of samples from a particular class to balance the data. This can help prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.
3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of samples from the majority class to balance the data. This can help prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from a variety of sources to ensure that the data is representative of the population. This can help prevent the model from being biased towards a particular subset of the data.

It's important to note that the choice of preprocessing technique will depend on the specific characteristics of the data and the problem at hand. Therefore, it's essential to carefully evaluate the data and consider the potential sources of bias before selecting a preprocessing technique.
