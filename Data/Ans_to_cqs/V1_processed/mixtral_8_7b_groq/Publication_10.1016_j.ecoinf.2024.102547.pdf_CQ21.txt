In the context provided, there is no explicit mention of postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps or Confusion matrices. However, there is a calculation of several metrics related to the model's performance. These metrics include Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for both training and testing datasets.

The RMSE measures the standard deviation of the prediction errors, while the MAE measures the average magnitude of the errors. These metrics are commonly used to evaluate the performance of a regression model. In this case, the RMSE and MAE are calculated for both the training and testing datasets, which can provide insights into how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

Additionally, the R-squared (R2) value is provided, which is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance for a dependent variable that's explained by an independent variable or variables in a regression model. The R2 value ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates that the model perfectly fits the data.

Therefore, while there is no explicit mention of postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps or Confusion matrices, there is a calculation of several metrics related to the model's performance, including RMSE, MAE, and R2. These metrics can provide insights into how well the model fits the data and generalizes to unseen data.
