The provided context does not mention any specific deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The focus of the text is on hyperparameter optimization for machine learning models, specifically XGBoost and LightGBM, which are gradient boosting libraries and not deep learning frameworks. The hyperparameters of these models are tuned using Bayesian optimizers and a sampling method named Gradient-Based One-Side Sampling. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine which deep learning frameworks, if any, were used in this study.
