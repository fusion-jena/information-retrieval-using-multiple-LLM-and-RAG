Based on the provided context, the following measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model:

1. Diverse dataset: Manual annotations were used to generate training, validation, and testing datasets. These annotations were likely derived from a wide range of images, as they came from the same transect as the testing dataset. This suggests that the model was trained on a diverse set of data, which can help improve its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

2. Cross-validation: Although not explicitly mentioned, the use of a validation set to evaluate the model's performance during training suggests that some form of cross-validation was employed. By periodically evaluating the model's performance on the validation set, the training process could be adjusted to improve the model's ability to predict unseen data, thereby enhancing its generalizability.

3. Stratified splitting: The context does not explicitly mention the use of stratified splitting. However, since manual annotations were used for dataset creation, it is possible that the annotators took steps to ensure that the datasets were representative of the overall population. This could include stratified sampling, where the datasets are divided into subgroups based on certain characteristics (e.g., species, size, or location) and then samples are taken from each subgroup to ensure adequate representation.

4. Regularization: The use of dropout, a regularization technique, is implied by the mention of "CNN node weights." Regularization helps prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which encourages the model to have simpler weights and thus be more generalizable.

5. Model selection: The process of selecting the optimum number of iterations before the performance on the validation and training sets starts to diverge helps ensure that the model does not overfit the training data. This, in turn, improves the model's generalizability.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, the described methods of manual annotations, validation set evaluation, regularization, and model selection contribute to ensuring the generalizability of the deep learning model.
