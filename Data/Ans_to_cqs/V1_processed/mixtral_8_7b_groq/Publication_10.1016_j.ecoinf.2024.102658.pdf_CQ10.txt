I don't know the answer to the query. The provided context does not include any information about a deep learning pipeline or its code repository link. The baseline model mentioned is a random forest model, which is a type of machine learning algorithm but not deep learning. Furthermore, the context focuses on the data collection, model exploration, and climate change scenarios, without mentioning any code repository or deep learning implementation.
