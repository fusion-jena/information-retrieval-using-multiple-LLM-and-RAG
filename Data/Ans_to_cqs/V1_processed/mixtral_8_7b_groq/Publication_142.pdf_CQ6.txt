In the context provided, there is no explicit mention of the specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model used in Pl@ntNet. However, it is mentioned that the model is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and fine-tuned on Pl@ntNet data. ImageNet, a large-scale image recognition dataset, typically involves preprocessing steps such as mean subtraction and divisional normalization to standardize the input data.

Additionally, the text mentions that particular attention must be given to the quality and completeness of the training datasets during the learning phases. This suggests that data cleaning and ensuring a balanced dataset are important preprocessing steps. Furthermore, the use of batch normalization in the CNN architecture implies that some form of normalization is applied during the training process.

In general, for deep learning models, common preprocessing steps include:

1. Data cleaning: Removing irrelevant, missing, or incorrect data points.
2. Data normalization: Scaling or transforming the data to a common range or distribution, such as mean subtraction and divisional normalization.
3. Data augmentation: Artificially increasing the size of the dataset by applying transformations like rotation, scaling, or flipping to the existing data.
4. Batch normalization: Normalizing the activations of the neurons in a layer for each mini-batch of data.
5. Balancing the dataset: Ensuring that the dataset is representative and unbiased, with a roughly equal number of samples for each class.

These steps help improve the model's performance, reduce overfitting, and ensure that the model can generalize well to unseen data. However, the specific preprocessing steps taken for the Pl@ntNet deep learning model are not detailed in the provided context.
