The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, we can infer that the authors used a validation set to estimate the optimal number of iterations for the Stacked Auto-Encoder (SAE) model. This is based on Figure 6, which shows the mean error and number of misclassified points for different numbers of iterations. The color bar in the figure represents the density of points, indicating that the authors used a large number of samples to evaluate the model performance at each iteration.

Furthermore, the authors used the highest J-M value as the criterion to select the optimal number of nodes in each hidden layer of the SAE model. The J-M value is a measure of classification accuracy that takes into account both omission and commission errors. By selecting the highest J-M value, the authors ensured that the SAE model achieved the best possible classification performance.

In the case of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, the authors used sensitivity analysis to optimize the gamma and cost parameters. They tested a range of values for each parameter and selected the combination that achieved the highest overall accuracy. This approach allowed the authors to evaluate the model performance for different parameter settings and choose the one that worked best.

Overall, while the context does not provide explicit details about the strategy used to monitor the model performance during training, it is clear that the authors used a combination of validation sets, J-M values, and sensitivity analysis to ensure that their models achieved the best possible performance.
