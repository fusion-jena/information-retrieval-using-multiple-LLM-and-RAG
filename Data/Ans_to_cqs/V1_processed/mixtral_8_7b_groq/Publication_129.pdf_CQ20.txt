The deep learning model for crop pest recognition was trained using a GPU, specifically an NVIDIA GAMINGX GTX 1080 8 GB. This GPU was used in conjunction with the NVIDIA CUDA Deep Neural Network library (cuDNN) to accelerate the GPU computations for deep neural networks. No other hardware resources such as TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) were mentioned in the provided context.

It is worth noting that the detection and classification procedures of agricultural insect pests were executed in a cloud computing system, which implies that the training of the model might have been done on a remote server equipped with the aforementioned GPU. However, the context does not provide explicit information on this matter.
