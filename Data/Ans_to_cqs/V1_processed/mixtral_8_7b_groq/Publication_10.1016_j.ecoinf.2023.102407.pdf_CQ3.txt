The provided context does not specifically mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of pseudo-labeling (PL) for data augmentation in the context of species distribution modeling (SDM). In the context of deep learning, pseudo-labeling is a technique where a trained model is used to assign labels to a subset of unlabeled data, which can then be used as part of the training set for a student model.

In the context of SDM, PL has been used to predict species distributions by training a teacher model on a subset of labeled data, and then using this model to assign labels to unlabeled data within the study area. The training settings and hyperparameters used for each SDM, including the teacher model, are described in Table 3 of the reference.

It is important to note that when PL based on a single-teacher model is used to predict species distributions, the teacher model can be easily biased towards specific environmental data, and the labeled data by this model may not represent diverse habitat conditions of the species and may lead to overfitting of the student model. To alleviate this, different teacher models can be considered for label generation and the most promising model among them can be used.

In summary, while the provided context does not specifically mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it does discuss the use of pseudo-labeling for data augmentation in the context of species distribution modeling.
