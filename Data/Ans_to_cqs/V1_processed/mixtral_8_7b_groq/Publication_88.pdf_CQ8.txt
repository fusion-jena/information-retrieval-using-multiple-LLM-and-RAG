The provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The article by Mabel Ortega Adarme et al. describes their research on evaluating deep learning techniques for deforestation detection in the Amazon and Cerrado biomes. However, there is no mention of the code repository's location in the given text.

It is essential to make research code accessible for reproducibility and transparency purposes. Thus, it is possible that the authors have made the code available elsewhere, but it is not included in the provided context. If you are interested in obtaining the code, you may consider contacting the authors directly. Their contact information is available in the article's first page.

In summary, the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study is not available in the provided context. You may try contacting the authors directly for more information.
