The provided context does not specify where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. There is no mention of any data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF in the context. The context only provides details about the experimental configurations and the results obtained from those experiments. It also mentions that the experiments were conducted using a fork of Cafe, a deep learning framework. However, it does not provide information about where the data used in the experiments can be accessed. Therefore, I am unable to answer this query without additional information.
