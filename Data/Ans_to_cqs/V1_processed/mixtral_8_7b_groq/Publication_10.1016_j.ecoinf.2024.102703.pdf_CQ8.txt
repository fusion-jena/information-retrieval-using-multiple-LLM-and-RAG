I don't have enough information to provide the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline because none of the given sources appear to contain or reference a deep learning pipeline or its code repository. The sources mainly discuss the study of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in different aquatic environments, their characteristics, and the factors influencing their concentration and distribution.

For example, Romera-Castillo et al., (2011) investigate the net production and consumption of fluorescent colored DOM by natural bacterial assemblages growing on marine phytoplankton exudates. Shang et al., (2018) characterize CDOM absorption in reservoirs across China and its linkage with regions and ages. Wei et al., (2019b) study the variation in spectral characteristics of DOM in inland rivers with different trophic states and their relationship with phytoplankton.

If you are looking for a deep learning pipeline related to the analysis or prediction of DOM or CDOM characteristics, I would recommend searching GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket for projects involving water quality, aquatic chemistry, or spectroscopy, as these areas might be more likely to contain the information you seek.
