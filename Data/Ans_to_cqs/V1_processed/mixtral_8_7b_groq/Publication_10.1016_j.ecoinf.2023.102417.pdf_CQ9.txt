Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the application of deep learning models for biocrust classification and monitoring, but it does not mention where the data used in the pipeline is stored or shared. It is possible that the data repository is not specified in the text because it is not the main focus of the discussion. However, it is important to note that when sharing or using data for machine learning purposes, it is common to use data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF to ensure that the data is publicly accessible, properly documented, and can be cited. Therefore, if the data repository for this specific deep learning pipeline exists, it would be best to check the original source or contact the authors for more information.
