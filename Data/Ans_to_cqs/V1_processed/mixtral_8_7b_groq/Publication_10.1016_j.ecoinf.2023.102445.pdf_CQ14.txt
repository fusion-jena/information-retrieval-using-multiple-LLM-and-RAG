Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, such as through methods like grid search or random search. The text focuses on comparing the performance of different models (YOLOv5, YOLOv6, YOLOv7, YOLOv8, and YOLO_MRC) in terms of accuracy, speed, and model size. It also discusses the impact of incorporating certain modules (Multicat, Reduce detection head, and C2flite) on the model's performance.

However, it is common practice in machine learning and computer vision tasks to optimize hyperparameters using techniques like grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization. These methods systematically explore the hyperparameter space to find the best combination of parameters that minimize the loss function or maximize the model's performance.

Since the context does not provide specific details about the hyperparameter optimization process for this particular study, it is not possible to give a precise answer. Nonetheless, it is essential to consider hyperparameter tuning when developing and comparing models to ensure that each model is performing at its best given the chosen set of hyperparameters.
