The provided context discusses a study that uses pre-trained models for image classification tasks and focuses on hyperparameter tuning to improve performance. However, it does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps applied to the data before training the deep learning models.

Generally, when working with deep learning models, several preprocessing steps are involved to ensure the data is suitable for model training. Some common preprocessing steps include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing or correcting erroneous, missing, or irrelevant data points that can negatively impact model performance.

2. Data Scaling/Normalization: Deep learning models, especially those based on gradient descent optimization, are sensitive to the scale of input features. Thus, it is essential to scale or normalize the data. Common scaling techniques include min-max scaling, which scales the data between a specific range (e.g., 0 and 1), and standardization, which scales the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

3. Data Augmentation: This technique is particularly useful for image data, where random transformations (e.g., rotation, flipping, zooming) are applied to the original dataset to increase its size and help the model generalize better.

4. Feature Extraction: In some cases, feature extraction techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), are applied to reduce the dimensionality of the data and improve computational efficiency.

5. One-hot Encoding: For categorical variables, one-hot encoding is used to convert categorical data into a numerical format that deep learning models can process.

Based on the context provided, it can be inferred that the dataset used in the study is likely preprocessed, considering the high accuracy rates achieved by the models. However, the specific preprocessing steps are not mentioned. Nonetheless, the preprocessing steps mentioned above are commonly applied when working with deep learning models.
