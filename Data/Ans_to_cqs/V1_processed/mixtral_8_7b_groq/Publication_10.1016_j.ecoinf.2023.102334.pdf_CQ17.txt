The provided context discusses the use of L2 regularization in a specific deep learning pipeline, but it does not mention other regularization methods such as dropout.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is a technique used to prevent overfitting in deep learning models by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages large weights and promotes smaller, more generalized models. This is achieved by adding the squared sum of all the model's weights to the loss function, multiplied by a regularization parameter, which controls the strength of the penalty.

The context also mentions that the dataset used in the study is not large enough and suggests enhancing the dataset to generate more data and solve the overfitting issue. This is another approach to prevent overfitting, by providing the model with more data to learn from, which can help it generalize better to new, unseen data.

Additionally, the context describes the use of a Vision Transformer (ViT) model, which is a deep neural network based on a self-attention mechanism that allows for large receptive fields. This type of model has been shown to be effective in natural language processing (NLP) and has also been applied to computer vision tasks.

The context also provides a formula for feature normalization, which is used to correlate the modulus of the feature with the quality of the input image. This normalization process is appropriate for identification jobs with poor image quality but not for the model used in the study.

In summary, the regularization method used in the deep learning pipeline described in the context is L2 regularization, and the authors also suggest enhancing the dataset to generate more data and prevent overfitting. Additionally, the study uses a Vision Transformer model and feature normalization process.
