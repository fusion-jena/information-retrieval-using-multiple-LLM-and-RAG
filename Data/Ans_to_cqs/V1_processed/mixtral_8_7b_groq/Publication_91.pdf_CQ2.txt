Based on the provided context, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images. The study describes a dataset consisting of 35,573 images for each of the 12 channels, covering 35 species. This results in a total of 426,876 images, which were split into three sets for training, validation, and testing. The images were center cropped to an equally sized rectangle and augmented in various ways, including flipping horizontally and vertically, adjusting brightness, saturation, contrast, and hue. Therefore, the deep learning pipeline in this specific study utilizes image data format.
