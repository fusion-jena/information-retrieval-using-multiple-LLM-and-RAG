Based on the information provided, there is no mention of specific post-processing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix generation, after the model training process in the STARdbi system.

However, it is mentioned that the STARdbi_train module takes the output directory of STARdbi\_split\_images as input and outputs a classification model (ResNet152) in the form of a binary pickle file. It can be inferred that the model training process involves splitting the images into training data, feeding it to the ResNet152 model, and then storing the trained model in a binary pickle file format.

Furthermore, the STARdbi\_inference module takes a directory with unannotated single-insect image files as input and uses the trained model to make predictions. It is mentioned that "lapping bounding boxes are merged, to form the final prediction," but there is no information on how the model's performance is evaluated or post-processed.

Therefore, based on the given context, it can be concluded that there is no information provided about the post-processing steps involved after the model training in the STARdbi system.
