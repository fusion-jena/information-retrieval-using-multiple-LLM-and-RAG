Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some relevant details about the methods used in the research that could imply certain practices aimed at improving the model's generalizability.

First, Runge et al. (2022) optimized the model's parameters to better capture the index response to wildfire, which could indicate the use of techniques like grid search or random search to tune hyperparameters. This process can help find a set of parameters that work well for the specific problem and dataset, contributing to the model's generalizability.

Second, the study used XGBoost, a popular machine learning algorithm known for its performance and ability to handle diverse datasets. XGBoost offers feature importance measures, which can be helpful in understanding the model's behavior and identifying potential issues related to overfitting. Although this information does not directly address the question, it suggests that the researchers used a method capable of providing insights into the model's generalizability.

Third, the study compared the optimized parameters' overall accuracy and kappa with the default parameters, showing improvements of up to 8.4% and 36.8%, respectively. This comparison suggests that the researchers evaluated the model's performance using some form of cross-validation, which is a common method for assessing generalizability.

Lastly, the context includes references to remote sensing studies that use Landsat data and Google Earth Engine for geospatial analysis. These studies typically involve large, diverse datasets that cover various regions and conditions. The use of such datasets could imply that the researchers employed stratified splitting or other techniques to ensure that the model is exposed to a wide range of input patterns during training, which can enhance its ability to generalize.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, there are indications that the researchers used techniques such as hyperparameter optimization, cross-validation, and diverse datasets, which could contribute to the model's generalizability. However, without more specific information, it is not possible to give a definitive answer.
