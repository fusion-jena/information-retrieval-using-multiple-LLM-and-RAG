Based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated. However, the context does mention the use of machine learning (ML) algorithms, including artificial neural networks (ANNs), for land use and land cover (LULC) mapping. ANNs are a type of deep learning model. In the context, ANNs are used in conjunction with other ML algorithms such as support vector machines (SVMs), random forests (RFs), and decision trees (DTs) for LULC mapping.

The specific purpose of the ANNs in this context is likely to be for classification. This is suggested by the description of the ML algorithms being used for "classification results" and "LULC mapping." ANNs are well-suited for classification tasks due to their ability to learn complex patterns and relationships in data.

It is also worth noting that the context discusses the use of Google Earth Engine, a cloud-based platform for processing and analyzing satellite imagery. This platform is often used for large-scale LULC mapping, and deep learning models like ANNs can be computationally intensive. Therefore, using a cloud-based platform like Google Earth Engine can help to efficiently handle the computational requirements of deep learning models.

In summary, while the specific purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context, it is likely to be for classification in the context of LULC mapping. The use of Google Earth Engine suggests that the deep learning model is being used for large-scale LULC mapping, and the computational requirements of deep learning models are being addressed by using a cloud-based platform.
