The provided context does not specify where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. There is no mention of any data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF in the given text. The article focuses on the use of a deep learning (DL) model for wildfire response of forest species using multispectral LiDAR data and synthetic data. It describes the methodology used for training the DL model, validating the classifications, and retrieving fuel models. However, it does not provide information about the data repository. Therefore, I cannot accurately answer this query.
