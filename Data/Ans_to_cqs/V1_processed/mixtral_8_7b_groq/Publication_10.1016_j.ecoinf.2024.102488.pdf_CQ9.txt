Based on the information provided, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a data repository where the pipeline's data is available. The context focuses on the use of remote sensing data for various environmental studies, including the use of GF-1 optical imagery, GF-3 SAR imagery, MODIS NDVI imagery, and other data sources. These datasets are used in different studies for tasks such as monitoring forested wetland hydrology, mapping multi-layered mangroves, and analyzing net primary productivity.

The studies mentioned in the context utilize various data sources and may involve machine learning or deep learning techniques for data analysis. However, the context does not specify any particular deep learning pipeline or provide information about a data repository where the pipeline's data is available.

In summary, I cannot provide the location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline because it is not mentioned in the provided pieces of context.
