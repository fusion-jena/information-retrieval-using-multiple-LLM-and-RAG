The study in question does not directly discuss the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does provide some context regarding the sources of data used in their specific workflow.

The researchers developed a workflow that utilizes citizen science data, social media posts, and a combination of textual and visual analysis to extract relevant records related to a specific species, in this case, red kites. The citizen science data and social media posts can be considered as the raw data sources for their workflow.

Citizen science data was used as a starting point for the workflow. These data were documenting and recording sightings of birds, specifically red kites. The researchers then used social media data, which included textual metadata and image content, to identify further relevant sightings. They employed off-the-shelf, pre-trained algorithms to reliably identify predefined classes such as the presence of birds in image data.

In summary, the raw data for the deep learning pipeline in this study was collected through citizen science data and social media posts. Citizen science data was used as the initial source, while social media posts, particularly the textual metadata and image content, were used to extract additional relevant records. Off-the-shelf, pre-trained algorithms were used to process and analyze the social media data.
