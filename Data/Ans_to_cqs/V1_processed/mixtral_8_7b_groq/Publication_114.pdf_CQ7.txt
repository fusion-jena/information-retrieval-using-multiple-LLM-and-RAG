The context provided does not give specific information on the criteria used to split the data for training the deep learning models. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to split the dataset into three subsets: training, validation, and testing.

The training set is used to train the model, updating the model's parameters based on the error of the predictions. The validation set is used during the training process to provide an unbiased evaluation of the model, allowing for the tuning of hyperparameters and early stopping of the training process if performance on the validation set stops improving. The testing set, finally, is used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data after the training process has been completed.

In the context given, it can be inferred that the data was split in such a manner since the VGG16 model was trained and then used to classify tree species in three different areas (Areas A, B, and C). However, the specific criteria used for the split, such as the ratio of samples assigned to each subset, are not provided. Commonly used split ratios include 60-20-20 or 70-15-15 for training, validation, and testing sets, respectively. The choice of split ratio depends on the size of the dataset and the specific requirements of the problem at hand.
