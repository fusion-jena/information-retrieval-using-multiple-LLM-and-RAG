The provided context does not directly mention the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the context of landscape photography and 3D spatial data. 

In the first reference, Cheshmehzangi (2016) does not mention any specific data format. However, the context implies that the CNN is being used to analyze landscape visual quality, which suggests the use of image data.

In the second reference, Guo et al. (2023) use oblique photogrammetry to construct 3D landscape indexes. Photogrammetry typically involves the use of images to create 3D models, so it can be inferred that image data is used in this study.

In the third reference, Ho (2023) introduces LaDeco, a tool to analyze visual landscape elements. The tool can analyze panoramic images, which suggests the use of image data.

In the fourth reference, Hooyberg et al. (2022) study the perceived restorativeness of coastal environments. While no specific data format is mentioned, the study likely involves the use of image data to analyze coastal environments.

In the fifth reference, Qi et al. (2021) use 3D spatial metrics to analyze the contribution to stress reduction. The metrics are derived from 3D models, which suggests the use of 3D spatial data.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that image data and 3D spatial data are used in the deep learning pipelines related to landscape analysis. Other data formats, such as audio and video, are not mentioned in the provided context.
