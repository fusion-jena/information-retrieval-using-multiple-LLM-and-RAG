In the provided context, there is no specific information given about the criteria used to determine when training is complete in the supervised learning workflow. Common criteria used to determine training completion in machine learning models include validation loss plateau, convergence of the learning algorithm, or reaching a pre-specified number of iterations or epochs.

In the described workflow, the focus is on the data collection and preprocessing steps for land cover classification using Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Random Forest algorithm. The data collection is performed within sampling plots, which are created by calculating 5% of the total area covered by the boundary and dividing that area by the number of vegetation types intersecting the boundary. The sampling plots are placed within the vegetation types described by Gertenbach (1983) to ensure that the training and validation points are representative of the diverse vegetation within each boundary.

The provided table shows the statistics for each photojob, including the percentage of non-woody and woody cover, overall accuracy, producer’s accuracy, and user’s accuracy. These statistics are used to evaluate the performance of the land cover classification model, but they do not provide information on the training completion criteria.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the criteria used to determine when training is complete in the supervised learning workflow is not specified.
