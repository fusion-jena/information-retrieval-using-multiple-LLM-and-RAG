Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling within the deep learning pipeline. The text primarily focuses on the TPEBO-LSTM model for hyperparameter optimization in forecasting carbon emissions.

Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the diversity of training data by applying transformations like flipping, rotating, and scaling to the existing data. However, the context provided here discusses the LSTM model's architecture, training process, and hyperparameter optimization but does not mention data augmentation.
