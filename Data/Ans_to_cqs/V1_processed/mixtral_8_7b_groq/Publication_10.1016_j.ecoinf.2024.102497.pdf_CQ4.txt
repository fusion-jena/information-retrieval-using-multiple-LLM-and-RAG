The provided context does not directly discuss data augmentation techniques in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of remote sensing data for bathymetry retrieval and water environment analysis. In such cases, data augmentation techniques can be useful to increase the size and diversity of the dataset, which can help improve the accuracy and robustness of the model.

Common data augmentation techniques for remote sensing data include:

1. Flipping: This involves flipping the image horizontally or vertically to create a mirrored version of the original image. This can help the model learn invariance to the orientation of the image.
2. Rotation: This involves rotating the image by a certain angle to create a new version of the original image. This can help the model learn invariance to the orientation of the image and also simulate different viewpoints.
3. Scaling: This involves scaling the image up or down to create a new version of the original image. This can help the model learn invariance to the scale of the image and also simulate different distances.
4. Translation: This involves translating the image horizontally or vertically to create a new version of the original image. This can help the model learn invariance to the position of the image and also simulate different viewpoints.
5. Color jittering: This involves randomly changing the brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue of the image to create a new version of the original image. This can help the model learn invariance to the color of the image and also simulate different lighting conditions.

These techniques can be applied to the remote sensing data before feeding it into the deep learning pipeline. For example, in the case of bathymetry retrieval, the authors of Sun et al. (2021) preprocessed the GF-6 (WFV) data by radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction, geometric correction, and image cropping. Data augmentation techniques can be applied as an additional preprocessing step to further enhance the accuracy of the model.

Therefore, while the provided context does not directly discuss data augmentation techniques, they can be an important part of the deep learning pipeline for remote sensing data analysis.
