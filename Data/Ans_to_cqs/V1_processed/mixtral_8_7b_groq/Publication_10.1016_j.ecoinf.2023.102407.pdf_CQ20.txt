The provided context does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It mainly focuses on the description of the study area, the SDMs used, their training settings, and evaluation criteria.

However, it is mentioned that deep learning (DL) is used in the training process for some of the SDMs. Generally, deep learning models require substantial computational power, and it is common to use specialized hardware such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) to accelerate the training process.


 The provided context does not offer information on the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It is likely that GPUs or other specialized hardware were used for training, considering the computational demands of deep learning models. However, this information is not explicitly stated in the context.
