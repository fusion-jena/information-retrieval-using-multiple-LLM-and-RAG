The deep learning models used in the pipeline are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Specifically, the models used are ResNet-18, ResNet-50, RepVGG-A0, RepVGG-A1, and MobileNet-V3. These models are all based on CNNs and are used for image classification tasks. ResNet-18 and ResNet-50 are residual networks that were proposed to address the degradation problem that occurs when the network depth increases. RepVGG models use a re-parameterization technique to decouple the training-time multi-branch and inference-time plain architecture, increasing inference speed while maintaining performance. MobileNet-V3 is a lightweight CNN model that is designed to be computationally efficient for mobile devices. These models were pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and fine-tuned on the PAD Full and PAD Lite datasets to classify images in the context of biodiversity monitoring.
