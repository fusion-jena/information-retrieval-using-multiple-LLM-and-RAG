The provided context does not specify the data repository for a particular deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some data repositories that are commonly used in ecological studies related to imaging. These include Figshare, Zenodo, Dryad, and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF).

In the context of deep learning in satellite and aerial images (Sci. Rep. 9, 14259), it is possible that the data repository is not publicly available or not specified in the paper. In the context of ecological monitoring efforts, such as for deep-sea mining by the International Seabed Authority (data.isa.org.jm/isa/map/), the repositories typically archive raw and/or processed photographs and video, capture information, image-derived data, and data collected synoptically with other sensors. However, the specific repository is not mentioned.

In the context of the Porcupine Abyssal Plain Sustained Observatory (PAP-SO), the data is available through the British Oceanographic Data Centre (BODC) and the Plymouth Marine Laboratory (PML). In the context of coral reef monitoring, the Australian Institute for Marine Science (AIMS) is mentioned as a resource for managers.

Therefore, without more specific information about the deep learning pipeline in question, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this query. It is recommended to consult the relevant literature or contact the authors for more information on the data repository used in their study.
