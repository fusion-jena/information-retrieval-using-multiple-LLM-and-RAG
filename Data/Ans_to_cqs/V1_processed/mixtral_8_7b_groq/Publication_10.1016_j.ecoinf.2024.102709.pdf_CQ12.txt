The specific type of deep learning model used in the described pipeline is YOLOv8n, which is a version of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection algorithm. YOLO is a popular convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that is designed for real-time object detection tasks.

In the given context, three YOLOv8n models (Models 1, 2, and 3) were trained using the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset, while the other three YOLOv8n models (Models 4, 5, and 6) were trained using the clusters of extracted numbers from the authors' own data.

The choice of YOLOv8n as the deep learning model in this pipeline is likely due to its suitability for object detection tasks, particularly in real-time applications. YOLOv8n is a smaller and faster version of the YOLO algorithm, making it an efficient choice for processing large datasets or for deploying the model in resource-constrained environments.

Another advantage of using YOLOv8n in this pipeline is its ability to perform end-to-end object detection, which means it can directly predict the bounding boxes and class labels of objects in an image, without requiring a separate region proposal step. This simplifies the overall architecture and reduces the computational cost of the model.

In summary, the deep learning model used in the described pipeline is YOLOv8n, a convolutional neural network designed for real-time object detection tasks.
