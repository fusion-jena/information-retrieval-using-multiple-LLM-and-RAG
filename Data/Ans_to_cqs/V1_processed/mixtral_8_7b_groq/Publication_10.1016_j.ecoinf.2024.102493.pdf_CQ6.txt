The provided context does not describe the preprocessing steps taken before training a deep learning model. However, it does detail the preprocessing of data for a specific study that uses the MOD13A2 dataset from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. These steps include proportional scaling, projection transformations, and mask extraction based on watershed boundaries. These steps are performed to prepare the NDVI data for analysis, not for training a deep learning model.

In general, when preparing data for training a deep learning model, there are several common preprocessing steps that might be taken, such as:

1. Normalization: This process involves scaling the data to a range of values, often between 0 and 1, to improve the training process. This can help the model converge faster and perform better.

2. Scaling: Similar to normalization, scaling involves changing the range of the data. However, it does not necessarily need to be scaled between 0 and 1. Scaling can be useful for handling features with different units or scales.

3. Data cleaning: This step involves removing or correcting erroneous or missing data. This can help improve the performance of the model by reducing noise and ensuring that the model is trained on high-quality data.

4. Feature engineering: This process involves creating new features from the existing data that can help the model learn more effectively. This can include creating polynomial features, interaction features, or using techniques like PCA to reduce dimensionality.

It's important to note that the specific preprocessing steps required will depend on the nature of the data and the specific deep learning model being used.
