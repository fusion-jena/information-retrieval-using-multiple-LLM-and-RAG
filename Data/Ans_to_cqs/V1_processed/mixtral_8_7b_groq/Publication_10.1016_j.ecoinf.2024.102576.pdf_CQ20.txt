The context does not provide specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It mentions the use of a U-Net model, a type of convolutional neural network, for land-cover classification and ecological information extraction. However, it does not specify the computing hardware used for training this model.

The U-Net model requires a significant amount of computational power for training, especially when dealing with high-resolution satellite imagery. Typically, researchers use graphics processing units (GPUs) or tensor processing units (TPUs) to accelerate the training process. GPUs are particularly well-suited for deep learning tasks due to their ability to perform parallel computations, which is essential for handling large datasets and complex neural network architectures. TPUs, on the other hand, are custom-built by Google for machine learning tasks and offer even higher performance than GPUs for certain applications.

Given the lack of information in the context, it is possible that the researchers used either GPUs or TPUs for training their deep learning model. However, without explicit details, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer.
