The provided context discusses the use of a deep learning pipeline for agricultural pests recognition, but it does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the training process. However, based on the common practices in deep learning, we can make an educated guess that some optimization techniques were applied during the training of the CNN detection network.

One possible optimization technique is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with momentum. SGD is a popular optimization algorithm for training neural networks, which updates the model parameters by taking a step in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function. The momentum term is added to the algorithm to accelerate the learning process and to avoid getting stuck in local minima.

Another optimization technique that could have been used is the Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) algorithm. Adam is a more recent optimization algorithm that combines the advantages of SGD with momentum and the Adaptive Gradient Algorithm (AdaGrad). Adam adjusts the learning rate for each parameter based on the estimated first and second moments of the gradient, allowing for faster convergence and better generalization.

The context also mentions the use of a Region Proposal Network (RPN) to propose object locations in the feature maps. During the training of the RPN, a loss function is used to adjust the proposed locations and to predict single or multi-object classes with the corresponding bounding box area. The optimization technique used for training the RPN is not specified in the context, but it could be the same as the one used for the CNN detection network.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for agricultural pests recognition, it is likely that some optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam were applied during the training of the CNN detection network and the RPN.
