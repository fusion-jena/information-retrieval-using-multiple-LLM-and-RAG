Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, the text does mention some techniques that could indirectly contribute to the model's generalizability.

First, the authors mention that they used data preprocessing techniques, such as resizing images and applying mosaic data augmentation, in the input layer of their underwater object detection network (UODN). Data augmentation techniques like mosaicing can help increase the diversity of the training set, which can improve the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

Additionally, the authors modified the original YOLOv8 network's feature extraction module (C2f) to better capture feature information from underwater optical images. They replaced the split operation, which divides input data into two non-overlapping parts, with dilated convolution and depthwise separable convolution. These techniques can help maintain the spatial resolution of features and reduce computational load, which could potentially improve the model's performance on new data.

However, these techniques do not explicitly address the generalizability of the model. To further ensure the model's ability to generalize, the authors could have employed techniques such as:

1. Diverse dataset: Collecting and using a diverse dataset with different types of underwater scenes, objects, and lighting conditions could help the model learn a wider range of features and improve its ability to generalize.
2. Cross-validation: Splitting the dataset into training and validation sets and training the model on different subsets of the data could help assess the model's performance and prevent overfitting.
3. Stratified splitting: When dealing with imbalanced classes, splitting the dataset into training and validation sets while preserving the class distribution could help ensure that the model learns from all classes and improves its ability to generalize.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the authors do mention some techniques that could indirectly contribute to the model's generalizability, such as data preprocessing and feature extraction modifications. However, employing techniques such as a diverse dataset, cross-validation, and stratified splitting could further ensure the model's ability to generalize.
