Based on the provided context, the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not mentioned. The study focuses on forecasting ecological water demand of an arid oasis under a drying climate scenario using deep learning methods. However, the particular datasets used for training and testing the deep learning models, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, are not disclosed.

The study does mention the use of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, a type of machine learning model derived from recurrent neural networks (RNN), and Bayesian optimization. These are techniques used to build and optimize the deep learning model, but they do not refer to specific datasets.

Therefore, without additional information, it is not possible to specify the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for this particular study.
