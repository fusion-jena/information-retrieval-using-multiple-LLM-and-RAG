Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context includes details about a study related to water quality prediction using machine learning models, with a focus on the model evaluation, hyperparameter selection, and the use of the Lazy Predict library. However, there is no mention of the data repository or where the dataset and the deep learning pipeline can be accessed. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
