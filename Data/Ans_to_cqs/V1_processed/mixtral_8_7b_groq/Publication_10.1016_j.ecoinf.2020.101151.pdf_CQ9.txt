I don't have enough information to determine the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The provided context discusses the Fire Weather Index (FWI) and Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC) data layers, their estimation by the Austrian Central Institute of Meteorology and Geodynamics, and their application in a Web-GIS application. However, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or any data repository in the provided context.
