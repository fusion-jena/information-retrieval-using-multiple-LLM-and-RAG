Based on the information given, the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model for downscaling near-surface wind fields to high-resolution topography are not explicitly stated in the provided text "Wind-topo: downscaling near-surface wind fields to high-resolution topography with deep learning" by Dujardin and Lehning (2022). The text focuses on the methodology and performance evaluation of the deep learning model but does not delve into the specific hyperparameters used.

However, it is mentioned that the deep learning model is based on a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architecture. Generally, for MLP models, common hyperparameters include learning rate, number of hidden layers, number of neurons in each layer, activation function, batch size, and the number of epochs.

In the context of wind-topography modeling, other studies have used different hyperparameters. For instance, Fridley (2009) used a learning rate of 0.01 and a momentum term of 0.5 for a neural network model. However, it is important to note that these hyperparameters are from a different study and not specifically for the deep learning model used in the "Wind-topo" study.

Therefore, while the specific hyperparameters for the deep learning model in the "Wind-topo" study are not provided, it is common practice to tune these hyperparameters to optimize the model's performance.
