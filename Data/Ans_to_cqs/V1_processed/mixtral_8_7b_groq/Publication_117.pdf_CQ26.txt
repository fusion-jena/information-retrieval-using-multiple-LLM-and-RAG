The provided context discusses a study that compares the accuracy of citizen science and deep learning methods in counting wildebeest in survey images. While the text does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, it does touch upon some related concepts.

The authors mention the potential for bias in the expert count, even though it is considered the gold standard. They also highlight the importance of filtering the data, which could be affected by the wording of guidelines, image resolution and sizes, or the set of volunteers participating in the project. These factors suggest that the researchers were aware of potential sources of bias and took steps to mitigate them.

In the context of deep learning, the authors mention the use of a training dataset created by selecting 500 survey images at random and tiling them into subimages. They then passed these subimages through a version of the YOLO DCNN using pretrained weights from the COCO dataset. This process can be seen as a form of diverse data collection, as it involves using a variety of images for training. However, the text does not mention techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling to address data bias directly.

The authors do acknowledge the importance of obtaining sufficiently large training datasets for implementing deep learning algorithms in bespoke applications. They note that citizen scientists have a clear role to play in this regard, as the algorithm they employed used crowd-sourced data to create the training sets. This suggests that the researchers see citizen science data as a means to increase data diversity and quantity, which can help reduce bias in the training data.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, it does touch upon related concepts such as diverse data collection and the importance of increasing data quantity and quality to reduce bias.
