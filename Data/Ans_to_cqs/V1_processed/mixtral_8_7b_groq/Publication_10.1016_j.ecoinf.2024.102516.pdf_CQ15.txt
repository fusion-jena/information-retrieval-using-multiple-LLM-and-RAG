In summary, the deep learning pipeline described in the context uses the Adam optimizer for training the ResNet50-FPN model during the first two phases. The pipeline applies class activation mapping to generate weak segmentation maps, which are then used for training the segmentation network. In the third phase, the network's weights can be used for training a plant cover prediction network or applied directly to vegetation data for zero-shot predictions. The optimization technique used in the comparison baseline is not explicitly stated.
