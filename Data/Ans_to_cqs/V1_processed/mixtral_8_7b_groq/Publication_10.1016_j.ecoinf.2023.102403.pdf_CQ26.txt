The provided context discusses a study that aims to understand and mitigate data biases in marine fish occurrence records from global database repositories such as GBIF and OBIS. While the text does not explicitly mention the techniques used in the preprocessing stage of a deep learning pipeline, it does describe several methods used to address data bias in this specific study, which can be relevant to the broader concept of data preprocessing for deep learning.

1. Weighting schemes: The authors use different weighting schemes to account for the variability in sampling efforts across space and time. By giving more weight to records from areas with sufficient sampling, the study aims to provide a more reliable contribution and reduce biases.
2. Thorough examination and refinement of data repositories: Scholars recommend a comprehensive examination and refinement of data repositories to enhance the quality and reliability of information. This step can help minimize errors associated with public usage of data repositories.
3. Curating and filtering the dataset: The authors curate the dataset by removing records with missing values in specific columns, duplicates, and taxonomic information not down to the species level. These actions help ensure a cleaner and more reliable dataset.
4. Analyzing the effect of attributes on records: The study investigates the potential relationship between body size, habitat depth, and commercial use with the representation of marine fish occurrences in the databases. This analysis can help identify and understand potential sources of bias in the data.

While these techniques may not directly map to the traditional preprocessing methods in deep learning (stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection), they do address data bias and can be considered as part of a holistic approach to preprocessing for deep learning. For instance, weighting schemes and analyzing attribute effects can be seen as analogous to stratified splitting and diverse data collection, as they aim to account for the variability in the data. Curating and filtering the dataset can be linked to oversampling and undersampling, as they help balance the dataset by removing or correcting erroneous records.

In summary, although the provided context does not explicitly mention the traditional preprocessing methods for deep learning, it does discuss techniques that can help address data bias during preprocessing. These include weighting schemes, thorough examination and refinement of data repositories, curating and filtering the dataset, and analyzing attribute effects.
