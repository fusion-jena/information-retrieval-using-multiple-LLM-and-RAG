The deep learning pipeline can utilize various data formats, including image, audio, video, and CSV files. The choice of data format depends on the specific application and the type of data available for analysis.

In the context of bioacoustic classification, audio data formats are commonly used. For instance, the study by Soldevilla et al. (2008) used spectral properties of echolocation clicks for Risso's and Pacific white-sided dolphins. Similarly, Yano et al. (2018) performed species-level classification of beaked whale echolocation signals. These studies demonstrate the use of audio data in the deep learning pipeline for bioacoustic classification.

In the context of image data, Connor et al. (2019) provided a survey on image data augmentation for deep learning, which highlights the significance of image data in deep learning applications. Moreover, the study by McDonald et al. (2009) used an acoustic survey of beaked whales at Cross Seamount near Hawaii, where images could be used for visual data analysis.

Video data formats can also be used in the deep learning pipeline. For example, the ERDDAP tool (Simons and John, 2022) provides access to a variety of oceanographic data, including video data. Although the specific use of video data for deep learning in the context of marine mammal research is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, it is possible to use video data for deep learning applications.

CSV files, which are used for tabular data, can also be used in the deep learning pipeline. For instance, the R package PAMpal (ct.org/web/packages/PAMpal/index.html) can be used for analyzing bioacoustic data, and it is possible to use CSV files for input data.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline can use various data formats, including image, audio, video, and CSV files. The specific choice of data format depends on the application and the type of data available for analysis. In the context of marine mammal research, audio data formats are commonly used for bioacoustic classification, while image and video data formats can also be used for visual data analysis.
