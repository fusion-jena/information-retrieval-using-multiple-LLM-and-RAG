The strategy implemented to monitor model performance during training involves the use of accuracy and loss metrics for both training and validation sets. This is demonstrated in the figures and tables provided, where models such as GRU, LSTM, BiLSTM, and MobileNet-BiLSTM are evaluated based on their training accuracy, validation accuracy, training loss, and validation loss. 

For instance, Figure 6 compares the training accuracy and validation accuracy of the MobileNet-BiLSTM model over 10 epochs. Similarly, Figure 7 illustrates the training loss and validation loss of the same model across the same number of epochs. These figures provide a visual representation of how the model's performance changes and evolves during the training process.

Moreover, Table 2 presents a comprehensive comparison of various models in terms of accuracy, binary cross entropy loss, model training time, total parameters, and total layers. This table allows for a direct comparison of the models' performance, facilitating the identification of the most effective strategies.

The accuracy metric is used to assess the proportion of correct predictions made by the model, while the loss metric, specifically binary cross entropy loss, measures the difference between the predicted and actual values. Lower loss values indicate better model performance.

By tracking these metrics for both the training and validation sets, the strategy allows for the monitoring of not only the model's ability to learn from the training data but also its capacity to generalize to unseen data, thereby mitigating the risk of overfitting.

Therefore, the implemented strategy involves a systematic tracking and comparison of the model's performance metrics on both the training and validation sets, providing valuable insights into the model's learning process and its ability to generalize.
