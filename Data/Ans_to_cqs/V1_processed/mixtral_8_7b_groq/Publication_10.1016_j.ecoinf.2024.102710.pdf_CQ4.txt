Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on transfer learning models, embedding spaces, and active learning sample selection strategies for classifying sound events. However, it does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques used.

Data augmentation is an essential technique in deep learning, particularly for image and sound data, to increase the size of the training set, reduce overfitting, and improve model generalization. Common data augmentation techniques for image data include flipping, rotating, scaling, and cropping. For sound data, time-domain augmentations such as time-stretching, pitch-shifting, and adding background noise are commonly used.

In the context of the provided links, the following information is relevant:

1. The BirdNET-Analyzer repository (link 5) contains checkpoints for BirdNET, a deep learning model for bird sound detection and classification. However, it does not mention any data augmentation techniques used.
2. TensorFlow Hub models (links 6 and 7) are pre-trained models that can be used for feature extraction or fine-tuning. Again, there is no information about data augmentation techniques in these links.
3. The Keras applications links (links 8 and 9) provide pre-trained models for computer vision tasks. These models might use data augmentation during training, but the context does not specify this.

Therefore, without further information, it is not possible to answer the query regarding the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
