Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the post-processing steps applied after training the models. However, it does mention some evaluation metrics and techniques used during the training process.

The context does not mention saliency maps or confusion matrices. Saliency maps are a way to visualize the parts of the input image that the model is paying attention to when making a prediction. A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification model.

However, the context does mention some evaluation metrics. These metrics are likely calculated after the model has made predictions, but it's not clear from the context whether this is done as part of the training process or as a separate post-processing step.

The evaluation metrics mentioned are not specified in detail, but the context does mention a "web application" that allows users to upload images of sorghum leaves and receive predictions from the model. This suggests that the model's performance is evaluated in some way when it processes these images.

In summary, while the context does not provide specific information about post-processing steps like saliency maps or confusion matrices, it does mention some evaluation metrics that are likely calculated after the model has made predictions. However, it's not clear from the context whether these calculations are done as part of the training process or as a separate post-processing step.
