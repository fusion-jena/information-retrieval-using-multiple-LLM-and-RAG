Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, we can infer that the model was likely serialized to a format that could be run on a different platform, since the authors mention the size of the output result (17,280) and the use of a full connected layer with 100 neurons and a Softmax activation function layer with 2 neurons as the eleventh and twelfth layers of their ICSNet.

The authors also mention that they adopt the inception module from GoogLeNet and build three inception modules in ICSNet, while adding more convolution layers than AlexNet but less than VGGNet and ResNet. This suggests that they may have used a framework or library that supports transfer learning and the use of pre-trained models.

Furthermore, the context includes information about the relation between the min-batch size and the accuracy and number of epochs, as well as the use of pooling and LRN for feature extraction and model generalization. These details suggest that the authors may have followed a standard process for training and evaluating their deep learning model, which could include steps such as data preprocessing, model initialization, forward and backward propagation, loss calculation, and parameter updating.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, we can infer that the model was likely serialized and run on a different platform, and that the authors may have used a framework or library that supports transfer learning and the use of pre-trained models. Additionally, the context suggests that the authors followed a standard process for training and evaluating their deep learning model.
