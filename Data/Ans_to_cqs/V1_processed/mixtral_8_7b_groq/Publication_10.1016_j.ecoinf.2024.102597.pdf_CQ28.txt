The provided context does not give information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The researchers considered deep learning algorithms for estimating water quality parameters (WQP) in lakes, but they decided not to use them due to the limited number of samples. Therefore, they used other machine learning models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and neural network models like the Ocean Color Network (OGN). However, the context does not mention the platform used for deploying these models.
