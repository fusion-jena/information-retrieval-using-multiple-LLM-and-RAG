Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling within the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses primarily on the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), specifically Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks (MLPNNs), to estimate carbon stocks. It discusses the training phase of MLPNNs, where initial arbitrary connection weights are assigned and then adjusted through iterative error back-propagation until a target minimal error is reached. However, it does not mention any data augmentation techniques.


In summary, based on the given context, I cannot provide information on the application of data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling in the deep learning pipeline.
