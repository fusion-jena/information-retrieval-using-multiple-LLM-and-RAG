Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, such as through grid search, random search, or any other method. The context focuses on the evaluation of the conservation status of the Orchidaceae family using various methods, including the IUCN Red List and machine learning models. However, it does not provide details about the optimization of the hyperparameters of the machine learning models used in the studies. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional information.
