I don't have enough information to answer the query. The provided context discusses details about data analysis and song variant patterns of certain species, but it does not contain any details about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model. Hyperparameters are important configuration variables in machine learning models that can significantly impact the training process and the final model's performance. Common hyperparameters include the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, number of hidden layers, and the number of neurons in each layer. However, the context does not provide any information about these or any other hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
