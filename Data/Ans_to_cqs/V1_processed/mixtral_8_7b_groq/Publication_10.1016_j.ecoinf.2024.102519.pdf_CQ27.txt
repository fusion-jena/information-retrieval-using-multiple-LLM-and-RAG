Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model. However, the research article by Wu et al. does mention some steps related to model development and evaluation.

First, the researchers used various machine learning methods, including deep learning, to predict ecological source areas (ESAs) in a study region. They would have first trained their deep learning model on a suitable dataset, which could have been created using the data sources listed in Table 1. These data sources include DEM, land use, NDVI, soil data, population, GDP, meteorological data, and vector data. The spatial resolution of these datasets varies from 30 m to 1 km.

Next, the researchers would have evaluated the performance of their deep learning model. They compared the deep learning model with other machine learning methods, such as genetic algorithms (GA), firefly optimization algorithms, and support vector machines (SVM). They considered various evaluation metrics, such as connectivity rate, IIC value, ecological source coverage rate, and fragmentation index.

However, the context does not provide information on how the researchers deployed their trained deep learning model. Model deployment typically involves steps such as model serialization, platform selection, and integration with other systems or applications. Model serialization involves saving the trained model in a format that can be easily loaded and used for making predictions. Platform selection involves choosing a suitable platform for deploying the model, such as a cloud-based platform or an on-premises server. Integration with other systems or applications involves connecting the deployed model with other components of a larger system, such as a web application or a data analytics pipeline.

Therefore, while the context provides information on the development and evaluation of a deep learning model, it does not provide information on the deployment of the model.
