In the context provided, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is a raster bands stack, which serves as the input layer of the convolutional neural network. This format represents a stack of various rasters, such as spectral channels from satellite images, each containing information about different wavelengths. This stack forms a multidimensional tensor, where each dimension corresponds to a spectral channel. Therefore, the data format can be classified as a multidimensional tensor or a raster bands stack.

Moreover, the raster bands stack is used for land use and land cover (LULC) classification, indicating that the data format includes multispectral or hyperspectral image data. While the text does not explicitly mention other data formats like audio, video, or CSV, it can be inferred that these formats are not used in this specific deep learning pipeline.

Another essential aspect to note is that the raster bands stack is used to train a deep neural network classifier to identify various land cover forms based on their spectral signatures. This implies that the data format should contain labeled data, where each pixel or group of pixels in the raster bands stack is associated with a specific land cover class.

In summary, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline described in the context is a raster bands stack or multidimensional tensor, which includes multispectral or hyperspectral image data with labeled land cover classes. Other data formats, such as audio, video, or CSV, are not mentioned in the context.
