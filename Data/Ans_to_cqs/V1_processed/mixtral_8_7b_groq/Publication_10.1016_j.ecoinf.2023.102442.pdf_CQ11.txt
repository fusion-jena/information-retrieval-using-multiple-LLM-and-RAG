Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about a specific deep learning pipeline and its associated data repository link. The sources mention the use of Google Earth Engine as a cloud processing platform and cite studies that use deep learning techniques, but they do not give a direct link to a data repository for a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I am unable to provide the data repository link for the deep learning pipeline.
