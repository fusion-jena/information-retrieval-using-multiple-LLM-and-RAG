The provided context does not contain information about the deep learning model or the platform used to deploy it, such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud platform. The context focuses on comparing the performance of different regression-based approaches, machine learning models, and ensemble models for species distribution modeling. It discusses the importance of considering the question at hand and the makeup of data used to train component models prior to performing the analysis. Furthermore, it suggests the need for further work using controlled simulations to objectively assess the performance of different metrics. However, there is no mention of deep learning models or the platform they were deployed on. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
