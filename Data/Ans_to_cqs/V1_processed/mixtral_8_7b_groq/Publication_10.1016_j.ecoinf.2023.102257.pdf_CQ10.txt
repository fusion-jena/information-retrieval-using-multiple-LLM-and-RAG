I was unable to find a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline in the provided context. The context includes several studies and models related to remote wildlife monitoring, camera trap image analysis, and species classification using machine learning and deep learning techniques. However, none of the provided sources give a direct link to the code repository of a deep learning pipeline.

Some of the mentioned papers have implemented deep learning models for species classification and counting in camera trap images, such as Norouzzadeh et al. (2021) and Whytock et al. (2018). Nonetheless, the context does not provide a direct link to the code repositories of these studies.

If you are interested in the specific deep learning pipelines mentioned in the context, I recommend looking up the papers and authors directly and searching for their code repositories on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
