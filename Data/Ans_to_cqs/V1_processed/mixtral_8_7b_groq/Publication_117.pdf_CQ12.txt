The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a YOLO (You Only Look Once) Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN). This information can be inferred from the statement "These results were filtered by discarding any object detections that did not correspond to an identification from the Zooniverse data. The remaining results were then processed using the YOLO DCNN" (Torney et al.). Additionally, the authors mention that "Two novel methods can potentially replace the use of manual counts by experts, the deployment of citizen scientists and the use of automated object detection algorithms, specifically deep learning methods based on multilayer DCNNs" (Torney et al.). Therefore, it can be concluded that the authors used a YOLO DCNN for object detection and counting in the provided study.
