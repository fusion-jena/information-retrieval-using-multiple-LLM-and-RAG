While the provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, it does touch upon related topics such as data processing and management, machine learning, and the use of software frameworks. These areas can provide some insight into how randomness might be handled in a deep learning context.

In the context of "MODISTools - downloading and processing MODIS remotely sensed data in R" (Ecol. Evol. 4 (24), 4658â€“4668. 2014), the authors discuss a tool for processing large volumes of remote sensing data. In a deep learning context, such data processing pipelines might include strategies for handling randomness, such as the use of fixed seed values to ensure reproducibility in data preprocessing and model training.

The context "Kawaguchi, Y., Ozawa, S., 2019. Exploring and identifying malicious sites in dark web using machine learning" (In: Gedeon, T., Wong, K., Lee, M. (Eds.), Neural Information Processin. ICONIPg, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol. 11955. Springer, Cham.) discusses the use of machine learning for identifying malicious sites in the dark web. While not directly related to deep learning, this context does highlight the importance of handling randomness in machine learning models, as variations in training data can impact model performance.

The use of software frameworks, such as PyTorch, can also impact how randomness is handled in deep learning pipelines. The context "Ketkar, N., Jojo, M., 2021. Introduction to pytorch. In: Deep Learning with Python, vol." discusses the use of PyTorch for deep learning. PyTorch provides functions for setting random seed values, which can help ensure reproducibility in model training and evaluation.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, it does touch upon related topics such as data processing, machine learning, and software frameworks. These areas suggest that strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines might include the use of fixed seed values for reproducibility, careful management of training data, and the use of software frameworks that provide functions for setting random seed values.
