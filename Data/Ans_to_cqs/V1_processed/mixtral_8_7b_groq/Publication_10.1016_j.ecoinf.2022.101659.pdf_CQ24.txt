The provided context does not contain information about strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Instead, it discusses the relationship between valve gape and environmental factors in certain aquatic organisms.

To answer the query, I would say:


The text provided does not discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. It primarily focuses on the relationship between valve gape and environmental factors in aquatic organisms. Strategies for handling randomness in deep learning typically involve setting a random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results, as well as techniques like dropout and data augmentation to improve model generalization and reduce overfitting.
