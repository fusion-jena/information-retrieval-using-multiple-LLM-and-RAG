The text provided gives some context about the data collection and management system used in remote sensing, specifically for satellite images. However, it does not directly discuss the methods for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer based on the given context.

However, I can mention some general methods for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline, which can include surveys, sensors, and public datasets.

Surveys can be a method for collecting raw data, particularly in cases where the data is related to human behavior, opinions, or other subjective factors. Surveys can be conducted online, through phone calls, or in-person interviews. The data collected through surveys can then be used to train deep learning models for tasks such as sentiment analysis, recommendation systems, or natural language processing.

Sensors can be another method for collecting raw data, especially in cases where the data is related to physical phenomena, such as temperature, pressure, or motion. Sensors can be attached to objects, buildings, or even living organisms to collect data continuously or at specific intervals. The data collected through sensors can then be used to train deep learning models for tasks such as predictive maintenance, anomaly detection, or object recognition.

Public datasets can be a third method for collecting raw data, particularly in cases where the data is already available and has been collected by other organizations or individuals. Public datasets can be found in various repositories, such as Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, or Google Dataset Search. These datasets can be used to train deep learning models for various tasks, such as image classification, speech recognition, or natural language processing.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific information about the methods for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline, surveys, sensors, and public datasets are some general methods that can be used for this purpose.
