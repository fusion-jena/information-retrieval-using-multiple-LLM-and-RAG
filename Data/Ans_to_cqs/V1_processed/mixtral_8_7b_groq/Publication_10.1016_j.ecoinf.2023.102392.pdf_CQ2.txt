The deep learning pipeline in the study mentioned uses image data formats as input. To be specific, it utilizes Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) data and SPOT satellite images for the image classification process.

The UAV data is processed using CATALYST PROFESSIONAL image processing software, which involves correcting camera parameters, setting up connection points, fine-tuning these points, and editing ground control points. This process ensures that the UAV data is georeferenced and prepared for further analysis.

Similarly, SPOT satellite images are used in conjunction with the UAV data to classify forest types and evaluate changes in the surface water of Dak Nong province from 2005 to 2022. The XGBoost image classification approach is used to combine UAV data with SPOT satellite images, achieving a total accuracy of over 86%.

Therefore, the deep learning pipeline in this study primarily uses image data formats, specifically UAV and satellite images, as input for the image classification process.
