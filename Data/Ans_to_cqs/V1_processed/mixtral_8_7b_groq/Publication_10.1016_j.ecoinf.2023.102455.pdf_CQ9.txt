I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The context mainly focuses on the configuration and hyperparameters of the CNN-BiGRU, RVFL, KELM, and CNN-BiRNN models used in the multi-temporal forecasting model of daily streamflow (Qflow).

The details consist of the number of CNN layers, filters, and kernel sizes, BiRNN and BiGRU layers along with their neuron counts, optimizer, activation function, epochs, batch size, learning rate, and dense units. Additionally, there are some specifications about the number of nodes, regularization parameters, and weight and bias random ranges. However, there is no mention of the data repository or where the data used in this study is stored or made available.

To find the data repository, I would recommend looking at the original research source or reaching out to the authors directly for more information. This will ensure you get the most accurate and up-to-date information about the data used in this deep learning pipeline.
