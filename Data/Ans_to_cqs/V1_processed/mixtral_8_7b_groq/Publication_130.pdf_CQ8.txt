The code repository for the deep learning pipeline is available on GitHub. It can be accessed at github.com/AndreCFerreira/Bird\_individualID. This repository contains the automated methods for collecting and generating large training datasets, as well as the steps for training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify individual birds. The development of this pipeline is described in a study that focuses on three small bird species: the sociable weaver Philetairus socius, the great tit Parus major, and the zebra finch Taeniopygia guttata, which represent both wild and captive contexts. The pipeline includes the use of low-cost RFIDs and cameras programmed to take labeled pictures when PIT-tagged birds land on an RFID-equipped feeder. Data pre-processing steps and training of an adapted CNN are also detailed in the repository. To prevent overfitting and enhance the generalization capabilities of the CNN, algorithms that add noise and modify the original images are used for data augmentation.
