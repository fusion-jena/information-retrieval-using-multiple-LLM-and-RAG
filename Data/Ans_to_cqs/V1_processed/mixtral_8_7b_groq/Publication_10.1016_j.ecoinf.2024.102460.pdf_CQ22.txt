The provided context does not specify the exact metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, which in this case is the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. However, it is common to use various metrics to evaluate the performance of deep learning models, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Accuracy is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions. It is a common metric used to evaluate the performance of a model. However, it may not be the best metric for imbalanced datasets.

Precision is the ratio of true positives (correctly predicted positive instances) to the sum of true positives and false positives (incorrectly predicted positive instances). It measures the proportion of correct positive predictions out of all positive predictions made by the model.

Recall is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives (incorrectly predicted negative instances). It measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all actual positive instances.

The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall and provides a balanced assessment of both metrics. It is a more reliable metric than accuracy for imbalanced datasets.

In the context of the LSTM model, the performance metrics used may include those mentioned above or other metrics specific to time series data prediction, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). However, the specific metrics used are not provided in the context.
