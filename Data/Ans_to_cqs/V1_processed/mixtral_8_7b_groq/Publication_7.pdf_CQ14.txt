The text provided does not give explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. There is no mention of techniques such as grid search, random search, or any other optimization methods. However, it does mention that different patch sizes were tested to achieve the best classification performance, and the three patch sizes of 28x28, 224x224, and 448x448 were found to be the most effective. This suggests that some manual tuning of hyperparameters was performed, but the specific method is not specified.
