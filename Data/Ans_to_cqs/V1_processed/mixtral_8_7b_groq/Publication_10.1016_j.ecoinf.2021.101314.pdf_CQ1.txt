The provided context does not contain information about the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. The text describes a study that involves generating redescriptions, which are interpretable queries about dental and climate variables, using a specific method with certain parameters and thresholds. The focus is on the analysis of the generated redescriptions and their filters, not on the data collection process or the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
