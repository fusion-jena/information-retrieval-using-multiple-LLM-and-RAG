Based on the provided context, there is no specific information given about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection.

However, the paper by Do and Tran (2023) mentions the use of a deep learning model in combination with an optimization algorithm to detect the dispersal of the early stages of spotted butterfish in northern Vietnam under global warming. It is likely that the authors followed standard procedures for training and deploying their deep learning model, such as:

1. Data preparation: The authors would have preprocessed their data, which may have included cleaning, normalization, and augmentation.
2. Model training: The authors would have trained their deep learning model on their preprocessed data. This may have involved selecting a suitable architecture, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN), and optimizing hyperparameters, such as learning rate and batch size.
3. Model evaluation: The authors would have evaluated their trained model on a separate test dataset to assess its performance.
4. Model serialization: Once the model was trained and evaluated, the authors may have serialized it for deployment. Model serialization involves saving the model architecture and weights to disk, allowing it to be loaded and used for inference.
5. Platform selection: The authors may have selected a platform for deploying their model, such as a server or edge device. The choice of platform would depend on factors such as the required latency, throughput, and resource constraints.

It is important to note that the above process is a general guideline and the actual process followed by the authors may have differed based on their specific requirements and constraints.
