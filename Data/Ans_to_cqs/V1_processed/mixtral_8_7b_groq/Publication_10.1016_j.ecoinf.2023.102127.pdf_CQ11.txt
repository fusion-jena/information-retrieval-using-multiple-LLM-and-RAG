The provided context does not give a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It mentions the ibis.iSDM package, which is a tool for curating less biased representations of a species niche while accounting for some of the biases that plague biodiversity datasets. The package uses different engines and response functions to infer species distributions based on biodiversity and covariates datasets. However, there is no information about a deep learning pipeline or any related data repository link. It is possible that the deep learning pipeline is not a part of the ibis.iSDM package or that the data repository link has not been provided in the given context.
