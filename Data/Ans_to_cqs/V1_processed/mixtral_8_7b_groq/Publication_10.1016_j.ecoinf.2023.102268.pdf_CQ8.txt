Unfortunately, the provided context does not specify the exact location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The author, DelWayne R. Bohnenstiehl, mentioned that the detection, feature extraction, and classification workflow have been implemented in a set of MATLAB codes. However, the context does not mention if these codes are available in public code repositories such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. It is possible that the codes are available upon request from the author or through the journal's website. Therefore, I would recommend contacting the author or the journal for more information regarding the availability of the code repository.
