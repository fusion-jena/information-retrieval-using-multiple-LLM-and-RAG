Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, I can describe a general process that is typically used to deploy deep learning models.



To deploy a trained deep learning model, the following steps are usually taken:

1. Model Serialization: The first step is to serialize the model, which involves saving the model architecture and weights to a file. This can be done using various formats such as HDF5, JSON, or YAML. In the context of the provided information, the Keras library was used to build the models, and Keras provides a simple way to save models using the `model.save()` method.
2. Platform Selection: Once the model is serialized, the next step is to choose a platform for deployment. The platform can be a local machine, a cluster, or a cloud-based service such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure. The choice of platform depends on various factors such as the size of the model, the expected traffic, and the required latency.
3. Model Serving: After selecting the platform, the model needs to be served, which involves loading the serialized model and making it available for inference. This can be done using various frameworks such as TensorFlow Serving, TorchServe, or Clipper. These frameworks provide a way to manage the model's lifecycle, handle versioning, and provide a REST API for inference.
4. Monitoring and Logging: Once the model is deployed, it is essential to monitor its performance and log requests and responses. Monitoring helps to identify any issues or bottlenecks and ensures that the model is performing as expected. Logging provides a way to trace requests and responses, which can be useful for debugging and auditing.
5. Scaling: As the traffic to the model increases, it may be necessary to scale the model horizontally or vertically. Horizontal scaling involves adding more instances of the model, while vertical scaling involves increasing the resources of the existing instance. Scaling helps to ensure that the model can handle the increased traffic and maintain the required latency.

In summary, while there is no specific information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model in the provided context, the general process involves model serialization, platform selection, model serving, monitoring and logging, and scaling.
