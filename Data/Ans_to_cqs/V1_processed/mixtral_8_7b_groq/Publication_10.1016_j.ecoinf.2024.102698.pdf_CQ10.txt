Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It contains details about the methods used in the study, such as the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoder (VAE) models, and convolutional neural networks. However, it does not mention where the code for this pipeline is stored or hosted.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query. If the source material includes a code repository link, it was not provided in the context given.
