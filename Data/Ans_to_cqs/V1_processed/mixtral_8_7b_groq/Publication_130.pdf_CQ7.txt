The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, in the context provided, are based on the purpose of the dataset and the number of available images. The data is split into a training dataset and a validation dataset. The training dataset is used to train the model, and the validation dataset is used to compute the accuracy and loss of the model, indicating if the model is overfitting or not learning features that are key for recognition.

For the sociable weavers and great tits, the goal was to use 1,000 images per bird for the training dataset and 100 images per bird for the validation dataset. However, due to the limited number of images available for some individuals, they applied limited oversampling to their training dataset only. They first selected 100 images for the validation dataset and then duplicated the remaining pictures until 900 images were available for the training dataset. This was done to prevent overfitting and ensure that the model learned key features for individual recognition.

The zebra finch data required 400 pictures for training and 100 for validation. For the sociable weavers and great tits, they collected images for 15 days and 7 days, respectively. When the RFID data logger detected a bird, it sent the individual's PIT-tag code to the Raspberry Pi, which was programmed to take a picture. They used Pi camera V1 5mp and V2 8mp for data collection.

In summary, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in this context are based on the number of available images, the purpose of the dataset, and the need to prevent overfitting and ensure that the model learns key features for recognition. They applied limited oversampling to their training dataset only, selected a subset of the data for the validation dataset, and ensured that the number of images per bird was sufficient for training and validation.
