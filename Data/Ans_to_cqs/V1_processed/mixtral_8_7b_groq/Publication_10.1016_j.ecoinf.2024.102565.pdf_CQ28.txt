The provided context does not contain information about the specific cloud platform used to deploy the Wind2TSM-Net deep learning model. It is possible that the model was deployed on a local machine or server, rather than a cloud platform. However, the paper by Peterson et al., 2020 mentioned the use of cloud computing for deep learning-based water quality estimation, but it does not specify which cloud platform was used. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this query based on the given context.
