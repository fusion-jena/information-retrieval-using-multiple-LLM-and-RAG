Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps applied after training the models. However, it is mentioned that the training and testing process was repeated 10 times for each algorithm, and performance consistency was gauged. This implies that some form of metrics calculation was likely carried out to evaluate the performance of the models.

Common postprocessing steps in machine learning models include:

1. Metrics calculation: This involves calculating various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) to assess the performance of the models.

2. Confusion matrix: A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model. It can be used to calculate various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

3. Saliency maps: Saliency maps are a way to visualize the importance of each input feature in making a prediction. They can be used to understand which features the model is paying attention to when making a prediction.

4. Model interpretation: This involves interpreting the model to understand how it is making predictions. Techniques such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) can be used for model interpretation.

Based on the context provided, it can be inferred that metrics calculation was likely carried out as part of the postprocessing steps. However, there is no explicit information about other postprocessing steps such as confusion matrix, saliency maps, or model interpretation.
