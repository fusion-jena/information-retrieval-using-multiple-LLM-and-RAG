In the provided context, the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2). 

Mean Squared Error (MSE) is a common metric for evaluating regression models, including deep learning models. MSE measures the average squared difference between the actual and predicted values. A lower MSE indicates better model performance, as it implies that the predictions are closer to the actual values.

R-squared (R2) is another metric mentioned in the context. R2 represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. It ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating a perfect fit. A higher R2 score suggests a better-performing model, as it explains a larger portion of the variation in the target variable.

In this particular study, the Deep Neural Network (DNN) model achieved the lowest MSE (91%) and the highest R2 score (0.91), demonstrating its superior performance compared to other models in predicting oil palm yields.
