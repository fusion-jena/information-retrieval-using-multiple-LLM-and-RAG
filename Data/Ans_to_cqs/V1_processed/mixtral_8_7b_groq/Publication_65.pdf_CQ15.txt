The deep learning pipeline in the study discussed uses Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) as the optimization technique. Specifically, the SGD optimization algorithm is used with an exponential decay learning rate scheduler. The learning rate is reduced by 0.5 following 50,000 iterations to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization of the models to unseen data.

Additionally, data augmentation techniques such as rotation, noise, and flipping are applied to increase the robustness and generalization of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classification. These techniques help to artificially expand the dataset, making the models more adaptable to various input variations.

It is important to note that the study does not explicitly mention other optimization techniques such as Adam or RMSprop. However, the use of TensorFlow, a popular deep learning framework, implies that these optimization techniques could have been used if required. Nonetheless, the study specifically focuses on the SGD optimization algorithm with an exponential decay learning rate scheduler and data augmentation techniques.
