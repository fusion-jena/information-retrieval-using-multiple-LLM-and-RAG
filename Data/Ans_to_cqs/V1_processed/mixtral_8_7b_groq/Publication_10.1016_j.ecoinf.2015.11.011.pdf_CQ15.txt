Based on the provided context, optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam are not explicitly mentioned in the pre-processing of imagery and segmentation process for 2009 NAIP imagery or historical imagery.

The context discusses the use of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), mean values of different bands, image brightness, contrast, homogeneity, dissimilarity, and second moment for segmentation and classification of images. However, these techniques are more related to image processing and feature engineering rather than optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines.

Optimization techniques like SGD and Adam are commonly used in deep learning to minimize the loss function and update the weights during training. These techniques help to find the optimal set of weights that can accurately predict the output for a given input.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is unclear what optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline for this specific use case. It is possible that optimization techniques are applied in a later stage of the pipeline, after the image processing and feature engineering steps described in the context. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
