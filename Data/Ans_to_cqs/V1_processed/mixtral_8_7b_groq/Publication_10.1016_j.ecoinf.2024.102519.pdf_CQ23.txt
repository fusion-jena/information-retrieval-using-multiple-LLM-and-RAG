Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, the text does discuss the process of identifying an Ecologically Sensitive Area (ESA) using genetic optimization algorithms and a fitness function. This process involves dividing data sources into candidate lists, considering key factors such as source area, distance from the center of the area, and importance value, and setting quantification conditions for these factors.

While this process does not specifically relate to the generalizability of a deep learning model, the use of a diverse dataset and cross-validation techniques could potentially be incorporated into this methodology. For instance, the authors could ensure that the candidate lists include a diverse range of data sources and spatial resolutions, which could help improve the model's ability to generalize to new data. Additionally, the authors could use cross-validation techniques to assess the model's performance on different subsets of the data, which could help identify any potential issues with overfitting or bias.

That being said, without further information about the specific deep learning model and the data used in the study, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer to this query. It is possible that the authors addressed generalizability in other parts of the paper or in their model-building process. However, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine this with certainty.
