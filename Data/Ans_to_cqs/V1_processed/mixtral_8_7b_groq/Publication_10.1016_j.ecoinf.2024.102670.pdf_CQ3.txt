The provided context discusses the use of crowd-sourcing for obtaining manual annotation of karyotyping images of chromosomes. However, it does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.

In the context of the paper by Sharma et al. (2017), it appears that the annotation process involved labeling the chromosomes in the karyotyping images, but the specific method of annotation is not specified. It is possible that they used a simple image labeling approach, where each chromosome is marked with a bounding box or a point annotation.

In the context of the paper by Xu et al. (2021), they developed a Convolutional Neural Network-based segmentation model for medical image analysis. In this context, instance segmentation could have been used as a data annotation technique, where each instance of a structure of interest (e.g., a tumor or an organ) is segmented and labeled individually.

In the context of the ecological informatics paper, the focus is on the analysis of network data, but the specific data annotation techniques used are not mentioned.

In summary, while the provided context discusses the use of manual annotation in deep learning pipelines, it does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used. It is possible that simple image labeling, bounding box annotation, or instance segmentation were used, depending on the specific application and dataset.
