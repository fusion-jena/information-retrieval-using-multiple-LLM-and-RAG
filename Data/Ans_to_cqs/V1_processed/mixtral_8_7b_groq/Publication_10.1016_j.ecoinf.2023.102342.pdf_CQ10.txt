Based on the provided context, there is no information given about a specific code repository link for a deep learning pipeline, such as a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket link. The context focuses on data mining techniques, measures, and applications in the field of pesticide mixtures and their environmental impact. Therefore, I cannot provide a code repository link related to deep learning pipelines.
