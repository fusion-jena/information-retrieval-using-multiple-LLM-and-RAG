The process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model involves several specific steps. First, appropriate water downloading gear and sensors are selected for data collection, and the acquired data is pre-processed through denoising, image enhancement, and correction. The dataset is then labeled and separated into training and test images for underwater target detection models.

Once the dataset is prepared, hardware servers capable of training deep learning models are set up to deploy the YWnet network. The hyperparameters of the model, such as learning rate, batch size, and network depth, are tuned to achieve the best performance of the model.

After training the model, it is necessary to serialize the model for deployment. Model serialization involves saving the model's architecture, weights, and other relevant information in a file format that can be easily loaded and used for inference. Common file formats for model serialization include HDF5, JSON, and YAML.

Once the model is serialized, a platform for deployment is selected. The platform can be a local machine, a cloud server, or an edge device, depending on the use case. For example, if the model is intended for real-time underwater object detection, an edge device such as a Raspberry Pi or NVIDIA Jetson may be a suitable platform.

To extract input information, the SRC3 block employs a parallel analysis of the input feature map using two convolution kernels. This approach allows for more comprehensive processing of the input features, enabling the model to capture both high-level semantic information and preserve relevant details during the feature extraction process.

Additionally, Krishnan et al. (2022) focused on data augmentation techniques to increase the size of training underwater datasets, leading to improved detection performance and average precision. Specifically, they added an attention module through the attention mechanism to better learn the correlation between data and enhance the overall model's performance.

In summary, the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model involves preparing the dataset, training the model, serializing the model, and selecting a platform for deployment. The YWnet network employs the SRC3 block for feature extraction, and data augmentation techniques are used to improve detection performance.
