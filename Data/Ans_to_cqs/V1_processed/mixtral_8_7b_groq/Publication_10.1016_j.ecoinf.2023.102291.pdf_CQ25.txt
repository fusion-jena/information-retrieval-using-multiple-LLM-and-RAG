The deep learning model in question is used for the classification of complex dolphin sounds. This was determined by the context provided, which mentions that the model was chosen based on its validation accuracy and precision for classification tasks. Additionally, the models were compared to a pre-trained ResNet152V2 architecture, which has demonstrated good performance in animal sound classification tasks. The algorithm developed in this study assisted in finding optimal parameters to construct a suitable training dataset for input to CNNs for classification tasks on complex dolphin sounds. The best model was built using a two-second window for classification. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model in question is used for the classification of dolphin sounds.
