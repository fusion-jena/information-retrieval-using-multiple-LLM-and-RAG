The provided pieces of context do not include information about the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text mentions the use of high-resolution remotely sensed imagery and deep learning for monitoring ecosystem service change in the City of Shenzhen, but it does not give the link to the code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested link.
