The data formats used in the deep learning pipeline described in the article "Seagrass detection in the Mediterranean: A supervised learning approach" published in the Ecological Informatics journal are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the data was collected from Copernicus marine environment monitoring service, which provides data in various formats including NetCDF (Network Common Data Form).

A Python script was developed to read each NetCDF pixel and return the bottom value of the relevant Copernicus variables, indicating that the data was processed in NetCDF format. Additionally, the authors used one-hot encoding for the categorical variable "substrate", which suggests that the substrate data was in a format that allowed for categorical values (such as a CSV file).

It is important to note that the specific data formats are not mentioned, and the above inferences are based on the information provided in the context. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query.
