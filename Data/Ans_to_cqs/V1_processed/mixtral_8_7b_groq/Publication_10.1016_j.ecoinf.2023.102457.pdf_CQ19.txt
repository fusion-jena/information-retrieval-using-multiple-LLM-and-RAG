The specific deep learning framework used to build the BirdNET model, which was utilized to extract embeddings for gibbon vocalization analysis, is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model was run in Python version 3.10, and the BirdNET code was based on a GitHub repository (<https://github.com/kahst/BirdNET-Analyzer>), which suggests that Python-based deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, were likely used.

The BirdNET model architecture is derived from the family of residual networks (ResNets), which consists of 157 layers with over 27 million parameters. This model was trained using extensive data pre-processing, augmentation, and mixup techniques. The model creates a mel-scale spectrogram between 150 Hz and 15 kHz and returns 1024 embeddings per 3-second audio sample.

Considering that the BirdNET-Analyzer GitHub repository contains Python code, it is highly probable that either TensorFlow or PyTorch was used to build the BirdNET model. Both of these frameworks are widely used in the machine learning and deep learning communities and have strong support for building and training ResNet-based models.

In conclusion, while the specific deep learning framework used for the BirdNET model is not explicitly stated in the provided context, it can be inferred that either TensorFlow or PyTorch was likely used, given the Python-based code available in the BirdNET-Analyzer GitHub repository.
