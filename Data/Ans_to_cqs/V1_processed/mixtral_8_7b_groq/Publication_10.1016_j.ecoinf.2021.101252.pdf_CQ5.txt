Based on the provided context, the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not mentioned. The text focuses on the description of a deep learning pipeline using various models such as ResNet, InceptionTime, LSTM, and CNN, as well as the AutoML procedure for selecting the best model. However, it does not specify the datasets used for training and testing these models. Commonly used datasets in deep learning include MNIST for handwritten digit recognition, CIFAR for image classification, and ImageNet for large-scale image recognition. Nonetheless, without explicit information in the context, I cannot provide the datasets used in this particular deep learning pipeline.
