The text does not provide specific information about the evaluation metrics used for the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that the performance of the models is statistically measured to select the option that best fits the data. Common evaluation metrics for deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions, while precision measures the proportion of true positives among all positive predictions. Recall measures the proportion of true positives among all actual positives, and the F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It is possible that one or more of these metrics were used for evaluation, but the specific metrics are not mentioned in the provided context.
