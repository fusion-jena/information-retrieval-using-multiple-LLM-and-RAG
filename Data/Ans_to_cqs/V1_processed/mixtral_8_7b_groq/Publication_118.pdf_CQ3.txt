The provided context does not give specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the dataset used in the study has been highly annotated and used in previous studies. The extensive annotation of the dataset allowed for the feature representation produced by the auto-encoder to be easily evaluated and trained on a higher proportion of non-silent audio clips.

In general, data annotation techniques used in deep learning can include various methods such as bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and others. These methods are used to label and categorize data, which is then used to train deep learning models.

For instance, in the case of image recognition tasks, bounding box annotation involves drawing a box around an object in an image and labeling it with a class. This helps the deep learning model to learn to recognize and locate the object within an image.

Instance segmentation, on the other hand, involves segmenting individual objects within an image and labeling each pixel with a class. This provides a more detailed level of annotation and allows the deep learning model to learn to recognize and segment individual objects within an image.

Semantic segmentation, meanwhile, involves segmenting an image into different regions based on their semantic meaning. This can be useful for tasks such as scene understanding and image analysis.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the study, it is mentioned that the dataset has been highly annotated. In general, data annotation techniques used in deep learning can include methods such as bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation.
