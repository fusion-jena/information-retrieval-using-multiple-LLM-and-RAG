The provided context does not directly discuss regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, it does mention the use of regularization paths for generalized linear models via coordinate descent, as described in the paper by Friedman, Hastie, and Tibshirani (2010).

In the context of species distribution modeling, overfitting can be a concern when there are limited data available, as mentioned in the paper by Fois et al. (2018). Regularization methods, such as L1 and L2 regularization, can be used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which encourages the model to have simpler weights and avoid memorizing the training data.

Dropout is a regularization technique commonly used in deep learning that randomly sets a fraction of the input units to zero during training, which helps prevent overfitting by making the model more robust and less dependent on any single input feature.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. This encourages the model to have smaller weights, which can help prevent overfitting by reducing the complexity of the model.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss the use of dropout and L2 regularization in deep learning pipelines for species distribution modeling, these are common regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning models. L1 and L2 regularization can be used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function, while dropout randomly sets a fraction of the input units to zero during training, which helps prevent overfitting by making the model more robust and less dependent on any single input feature.
