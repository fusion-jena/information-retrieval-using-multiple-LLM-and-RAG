Based on the provided context, the text does not discuss a deep learning model directly. The model being discussed is a cellular automaton used for ecological informatics, and the authors are discussing modifications to improve its accuracy and efficiency.

However, the authors do mention the use of machine learning tools, which implies the use of hyperparameters commonly found in deep learning models. These hyperparameters include:

1. Learning rate: This determines the size of the steps the model takes during training to update the weights and biases. A learning rate that is too high may cause the model to converge too quickly to a suboptimal solution, while a learning rate that is too low may cause the training process to be very slow.
2. Optimizer: This is the algorithm used to update the weights and biases during training. Common optimizers include stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop.

Additionally, the authors mention the modification of the update criterion to make it differentiable, which is a common requirement for deep learning models.

Therefore, while the specific hyperparameters used in the model are not mentioned, it is likely that the authors used standard hyperparameters found in deep learning models, such as a learning rate and optimizer.
