The provided context discusses the use of a vision transformer (ViT) model for identifying sika deer, and mentions an improved SoftMax function used in the training process. However, it does not explicitly mention any optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam.

In general, optimization techniques are used to minimize the loss function and improve the performance of deep learning models during training. Some commonly used optimization techniques include:

1. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD): This is a simple optimization algorithm that updates the model parameters by taking a step in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters.
2. Momentum: This is an optimization technique that helps the model overcome local minima by adding a fraction of the previous update to the current update.
3. Adagrad: This is an optimization algorithm that adapts the learning rate for each parameter based on the historical gradient information.
4. Adadelta: This is an optimization algorithm that adapts the learning rate based on the historical gradient information, similar to Adagrad, but uses a running average of the historical gradient information instead of the sum.
5. Adam: This is an optimization algorithm that combines the ideas from Adagrad and momentum, and is widely used in deep learning due to its efficiency and effectiveness.

Without further information, it is not possible to determine which optimization techniques were used in the deep learning pipeline for the ViT model discussed in the context.
