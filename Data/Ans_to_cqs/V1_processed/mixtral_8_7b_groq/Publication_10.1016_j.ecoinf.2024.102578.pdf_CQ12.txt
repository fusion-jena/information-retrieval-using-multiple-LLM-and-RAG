The type of deep learning model used in the described pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). More specifically, the ResNet-50 architecture is utilized, which is a 50-layer deep CNN. This model is chosen for its proven effectiveness in image classification tasks. The use of a CNN like ResNet-50 is particularly suitable for this task as it is efficient in extracting features from images, making it an ideal choice for analyzing and classifying Arctic wildlife in time-lapse camera images.
