The preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model can vary depending on the specific task and data being used. However, some common preprocessing steps include normalization, scaling, and cleaning.

In the context of the first piece of information provided, Liu and Abd-Elrahman (2018) use multi-view object-based analysis of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) imagery for wetlands classification. While they do not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps taken before training their deep convolutional neural network, it can be inferred that some preprocessing was done. For example, they mention using imagery from UAS, which suggests that the images were possibly orthorectified and georeferenced before being used for analysis.

Marasigan et al. (2019) measured mangrove crown diameter from airborne lidar data using a marker-controlled watershed algorithm. While they do not mention preprocessing steps taken before training their machine learning model, they do mention using a digital surface model (DSM) and a digital terrain model (DTM) derived from the lidar data. These models may have undergone preprocessing steps such as filtering and normalization before being used.

Martins et al. (2021) used machine learning and SLIC for tree canopies segmentation in urban areas. They mention using aerial images that were preprocessed by applying a gamma correction and histogram equalization to enhance the contrast of the images. They also mention normalizing the images by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.

Chen et al. (2021) segmented individual tree crowns directly from UAV-borne LiDAR data using PointNet of deep learning. They mention filtering the LiDAR data to remove noise and outliers before segmenting the tree crowns.

Chen et al. (2023) studied the effects of spatial resolution and resampling on the classification accuracy of wetland vegetation species and ground objects using high spatial resolution UAV images. They mention resampling the images to a uniform resolution and normalizing the pixel values by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.

In the context of the Faster R-CNN detector used for individual mangrove trees, low shrubs, and other classes detection, the preprocessing steps involved include manually labeling individual mangrove trees, low shrubs, and other classes on the bird's eye view (BEV) images. The BEV images with bounding box labels were then used to train the Faster R-CNN detector.

Overall, preprocessing steps for deep learning models can include filtering, normalization, scaling, cleaning, and enhancing the contrast of the images. These steps can help improve the accuracy and efficiency of the deep learning model.
