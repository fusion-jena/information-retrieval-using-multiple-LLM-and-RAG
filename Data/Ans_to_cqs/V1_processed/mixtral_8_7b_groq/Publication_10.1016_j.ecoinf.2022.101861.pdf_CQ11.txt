The provided context does not give information about a deep learning pipeline or any data repository link related to it. The context focuses on the use of existing citizen science platforms and public online databases to identify bird species, particularly nightjars in the Brazilian Pantanal. The two platforms mentioned are eBird (<http://www.ebird.org>) and Xeno-canto (<http://www.xeno-canto.org>). eBird is used to gather observation data, while Xeno-canto is used for bird sound recordings. A study by Wood et al. (2022) utilized Xeno-canto's large dataset to develop machine-learning algorithms for bird species identification by sound. However, there is no information about a specific deep learning pipeline or data repository link associated with this study.
