The specific datasets used in the provided context are not mentioned. However, it is mentioned that the experiments were performed on a small-size dataset without data augmentation. Additionally, the models were tested on their own validation set.

In general, there are several popular datasets used in deep learning pipelines for image classification tasks. Some of these include:

1. MNIST: A dataset of handwritten digits (0-9) consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
2. CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100: Datasets of 32x32 color images, consisting of 60,000 images in 10 or 100 classes, with 6,000 images per class. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
3. ImageNet: A large-scale dataset of over 1 million images, with 1000 classes and 1000 images per class. It is commonly used for object recognition and detection tasks.

These datasets are widely used in research and practice for training and evaluating deep learning models for image classification tasks.

An example of a deep learning pipeline using one of these datasets is the AlexNet architecture, which was proposed for image classification on the ImageNet dataset. The AlexNet architecture consists of eight layers, including five convolutional layers and three fully connected layers. The model was trained using stochastic gradient descent and the backpropagation algorithm, and the learning rate was set to 10-2 for all layers initially.

In summary, while the specific datasets used in the provided context are not mentioned, there are several popular datasets commonly used for image classification tasks in deep learning pipelines, such as MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet. The AlexNet architecture is an example of a deep learning pipeline using the ImageNet dataset.
