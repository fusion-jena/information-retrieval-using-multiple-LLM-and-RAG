I'm sorry for any confusion, but the provided context does not include information about a data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context mainly discusses data sources used in fieldwork and analysis, including archaeological survey data from the Israel Antiquities Authority, remotely sensed data, digital maps from the Israeli Ministry of Agriculture, georegistered orthophotos from the Survey of Israel, substrate data from the Israel geological survey, and climate-related data from the Israel Meteorological Service and the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. However, it does not mention any data repository link for a deep learning pipeline.
