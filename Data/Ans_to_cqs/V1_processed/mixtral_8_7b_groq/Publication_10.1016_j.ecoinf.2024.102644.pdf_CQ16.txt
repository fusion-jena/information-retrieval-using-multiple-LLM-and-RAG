Based on the provided context, there is no information given about the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The context mainly discusses the advantages and drawbacks of using MaxEnt models for predicting species distributions, as well as indications for policy-making authorities. It mentions the use of a threshold on the probability distribution function to classify suitable/unsuitable locations for species presence, but it does not mention any criteria for determining when training is complete. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional information.
