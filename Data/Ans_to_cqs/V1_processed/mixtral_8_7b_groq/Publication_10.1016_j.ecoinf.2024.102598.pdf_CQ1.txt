Based on the provided context, the specific data related to forest fires used in the studies mentioned does not seem to be explained in terms of how it was collected. However, I can provide some general methods that are typically used for collecting raw data in the context of deep learning, particularly for tasks related to environmental monitoring like forest fire detection.


In the deep learning pipeline, raw data can be collected through various methods such as surveys, sensors, and public datasets. 

Surveys can be a useful method for collecting data, especially when human observation or expertise is required. For instance, surveys might be used to gather information about the types of vegetation in a particular area, which could be relevant for predicting the likelihood of a forest fire.

Sensors are another common method for collecting raw data in deep learning tasks related to environmental monitoring. Sensors can be used to collect a wide range of data, including temperature, humidity, and the presence of smoke or other gases that might indicate a forest fire. These sensors can be placed in strategic locations to monitor conditions that are relevant to forest fires.

Public datasets are also a valuable source of raw data for deep learning tasks. In the context of forest fire detection, there are several public datasets available that provide information about historical forest fires, as well as real-time data about current conditions. These datasets can be used to train deep learning models to detect patterns and relationships that are indicative of forest fires.

In the studies mentioned in the context, it appears that the data was collected through a combination of sensors and public datasets. The specific sources of the data are not mentioned, but it is noted that the data covers several states in India and includes information about the number of forest fires, the area burned, and the percentage of forest area affected. This data was then used to develop models for predicting forest fire risk using various techniques, including data mining and machine learning.
