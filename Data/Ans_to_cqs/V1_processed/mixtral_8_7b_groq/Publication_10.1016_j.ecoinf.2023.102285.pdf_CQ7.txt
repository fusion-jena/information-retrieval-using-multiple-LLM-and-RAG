The context provided does not give specific details about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, it does mention that the model is tested using another dataset completely different from the first dataset to observe if the test results are satisfactory, which implies that some sort of data splitting has occurred. It also mentions the need to evaluate the model with a completely new dataset independent from the first and second datasets, which again suggests data splitting. The document also outlines a methodology that includes four phases, one of which involves testing the model, but it does not specify how the data is split for this testing phase. Therefore, while it is clear that data splitting is part of the process, the specific criteria used for this split are not provided in the context.
