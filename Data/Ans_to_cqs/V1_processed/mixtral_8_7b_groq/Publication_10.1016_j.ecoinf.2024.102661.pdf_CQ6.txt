While the provided context does not directly mention preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning, these are common practices in preparing data for deep learning models. 

Normalization is a process that scales numeric variables to a common range, often between 0 and 1. This can help deep learning models converge during training and can improve the model's ability to learn. Scaling is similar to normalization but may not necessarily involve changing the range to 0 and 1. It could involve other transformations that maintain the distribution of the data but change its scale.

Cleaning refers to the process of handling missing values, outliers, and incorrect data. This is crucial because deep learning models can be sensitive to the quality of the data they are trained on. Missing values can be handled in various ways, such as imputation (filling in with a calculated value), deletion (removing the row or column), or using models that can handle missing values. Outliers can be handled by removing them, transforming the data, or using models that are robust to outliers.

However, the provided context does mention the importance of avoiding overfitting, which is closely related to the data preprocessing steps. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, and performs poorly on unseen data. The L2 regularization parameter mentioned in the context is a technique to prevent overfitting. It works by adding a penalty to the loss function that is proportional to the size of the weights. This encourages the model to keep its weights small, making it less likely to learn the noise in the training data.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention normalization, scaling, or cleaning, these are common and important preprocessing steps for deep learning models. The context does mention techniques to avoid overfitting, which is closely related to these preprocessing steps.
