I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include information about the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context includes details about the methods used for image classification, such as the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with varying input image sizes, and the comparison of different architectures based on ResNet and Inception. The training strategy and parameter tuning for random forest classifiers are also discussed. However, there is no information about where the data used in this study is hosted or made available for reuse. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to the query.
