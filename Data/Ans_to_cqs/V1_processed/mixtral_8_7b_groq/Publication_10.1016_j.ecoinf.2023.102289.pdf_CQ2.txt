In the deep learning pipeline, various data formats can be used depending on the specific task and requirements. However, based on the provided context, it is clear that image data is used as input for the LaDeco system. The images are analyzed using semantic segmentation (SS), a technology that assigns specific objects to each pixel of an image. This is essential for the landscape analysis performed by LaDeco.

After the SS model produces a pixel count for 150 objects, any data that falls below a certain threshold are assigned a value of zero. The percentages of each element and category are then calculated based on a visual landscape classification framework. The results are exported in Comma-Separated Values (CSV) format, which is a common format for data analysis and further statistical processing.

Therefore, in the context of LaDeco, image data is used as input, and the output is provided in CSV format. The context does not mention the use of other data formats such as audio or video.

In summary, the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline described in the provided context are image data as input and CSV format for the output.
