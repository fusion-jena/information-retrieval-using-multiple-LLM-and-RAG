Based on the provided context, the criteria for splitting data for deep learning model training, such as train, test, and validation sets, are not explicitly mentioned. However, it does discuss some approaches to data splitting and selection that are relevant to consider.

In the context "Keshavamurthy, R., Dixon, S., Pazdernik, K.T., Charles, L.E., 2022. Predicting infectious disease for biopreparedness and response: a systematic review of machine learning and deep learning approaches," they discuss various methods for predicting infectious diseases using machine learning and deep learning techniques. Still, they do not mention specific criteria for splitting data.

The context "Meyer and Pebesma, 2021" discuss the creation of a mask to delineate the "area of applicability" for a trained model, which would filter out regions lacking training data. This approach could be used to create a more targeted training dataset.

The context "Meyer et al., 2019" discuss spatial cross-validation techniques for model robustness. This method involves randomly selecting blocks of data for training while reserving others for testing, which could help ensure that the model performs well across different spatial regions.

In the context "Khun, M., 2022. Classification and Regression Training: Package caret," they mention the importance of separating training and test data beforehand. However, this approach can introduce bias, particularly when dealing with data that contains many zero values.

In the study "Laaksonen, M., Sajanti, E., Sormunen, J.J., Penttinen, R., H¨anninen, J., Ruohom¨aki, K., et al., 2017. Crowdsourcing-based nationwide tick collection reveals the distribution of Ixodes ricinus and I. persulcatus and associated pathogens in Finland," they used crowdsourcing to collect tick data and then used this data to analyze the distribution of ticks and associated pathogens in Finland. While they do not explicitly mention data splitting criteria, they do emphasize the importance of collecting a large and diverse dataset for accurate model training.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria for splitting data for deep learning model training, it does discuss some relevant approaches to data splitting and selection. These include creating a mask to delineate the "area of applicability" for a trained model, using spatial cross-validation techniques, separating training and test data beforehand, and collecting a large and diverse dataset.
