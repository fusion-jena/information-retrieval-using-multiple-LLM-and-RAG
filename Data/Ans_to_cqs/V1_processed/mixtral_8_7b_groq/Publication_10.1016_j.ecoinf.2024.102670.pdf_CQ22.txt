In the evaluation of the deep learning model's performance on fungal image datasets, several metrics have been used, including average precision, recall, F1-measure, and Modified Mean Curvature (MMC). These metrics are commonly used in the assessment of image analysis tasks, providing insights into the model's ability to identify and delineate fungal structures.

Precision, recall, and F1-measure are statistical values derived from the confusion matrix, which consists of true positives (TP), false positives (FP), true negatives (TN), and false negatives (FN). Precision is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives, representing the proportion of correctly identified positive instances among all positive predictions. Recall, on the other hand, is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives, indicating the fraction of actual positive instances that were correctly identified. F1-measure is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced assessment of both measures.

Modified Mean Curvature (MMC) is a metric specifically designed for the evaluation of mycelium segmentation performance. It quantifies the similarity between the segmented mycelium and the ground truth by calculating the mean curvature of the boundary between the two. Lower MMC values indicate better alignment between the segmented and ground truth mycelium, suggesting superior model performance.

In addition to these metrics, Lin's Concordance Coefficient (œÅc) has been used to assess the agreement between the gold standard method (manual tracing) and the proposed automated method for measuring mycelium length. This statistical measure evaluates the strength and direction of the relationship between two continuous variables, providing a valuable assessment of the automated method's accuracy in estimating mycelium length.

It is important to note that the choice of metrics depends on the specific task and the desired outcome. In the context of fungal image analysis, the aforementioned metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the deep learning model's performance, aiding in the identification of strengths and weaknesses and informing potential improvements.
