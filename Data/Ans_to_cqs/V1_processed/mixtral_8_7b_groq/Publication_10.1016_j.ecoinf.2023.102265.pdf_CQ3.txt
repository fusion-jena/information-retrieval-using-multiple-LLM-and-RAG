The provided context discusses the use of a deep learning model for feature extraction from image backgrounds, specifically using a ResNet-50 model. However, it does not mention any details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

Data annotation is a crucial step in training deep learning models for computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation. Some common data annotation techniques include:

1. Image-level annotation: In this technique, each image is labeled with a single class or category. This is the simplest form of annotation and is commonly used for image classification tasks.
2. Bounding box annotation: In this technique, a bounding box is drawn around each object of interest in an image. This is used for object detection tasks where the goal is to locate and identify objects within an image.
3. Semantic segmentation: In this technique, each pixel in an image is labeled with a specific class or category. This is used for image segmentation tasks where the goal is to partition an image into multiple regions or segments based on their semantic meaning.
4. Instance segmentation: In this technique, each instance of an object is segmented and labeled individually. This is used for tasks where the goal is to not only locate and identify objects but also distinguish between multiple instances of the same object.

Without further information, it is not possible to determine which of these data annotation techniques were used in the deep learning pipeline described in the provided context.
