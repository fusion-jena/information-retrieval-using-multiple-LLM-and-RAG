After the model training phase, there are several postprocessing steps that can be involved, such as the calculation of various metrics, generation of saliency maps, and creation of a confusion matrix. However, based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of saliency maps or a confusion matrix being generated after training the CNN model. Therefore, I will focus on the postprocessing steps that are mentioned in the context, which include the calculation of metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

Firstly, the trained model is used to predict the presence of target species in test data, which primarily consists of soundscapes. The predictions are then evaluated using various metrics. Precision, recall, and F1-score are commonly used metrics for evaluating classification models. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions (correctly identifying the presence of a species) among all positive predictions. Recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positives (i.e., the species is truly present in the test data). F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both.

In the provided context, the authors mention that they used the F1-score as their primary evaluation metric. They also state that they calculated the F1-score for each species separately, allowing them to evaluate the performance of their model for each target species individually.

Furthermore, the authors mention that they used location-specific training data, which significantly improved the performance of their acoustic monitoring system. This suggests that they might have calculated metrics for each location separately, allowing them to evaluate the performance of their model for each location.

In summary, the postprocessing steps involved after model training, as mentioned in the provided context, include the calculation of metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score. The authors used the F1-score as their primary evaluation metric and calculated it for each species and possibly for each location separately. However, there is no explicit mention of saliency maps or a confusion matrix being generated in the postprocessing phase.
