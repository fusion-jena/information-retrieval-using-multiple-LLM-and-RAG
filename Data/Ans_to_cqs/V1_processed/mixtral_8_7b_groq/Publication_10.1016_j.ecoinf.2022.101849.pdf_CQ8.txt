Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context focuses on the formulation of a new computational setting for regression in predictive modeling of global vegetation cover, with target labels that are structurally incomplete. It discusses various related work on potential natural vegetation (PNV) modeling, including machine learning methods used for PNV mapping. However, it does not mention any code repository or provide details about the deep learning pipeline used in the study. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information.
