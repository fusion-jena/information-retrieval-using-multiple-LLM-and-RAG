The provided context does not contain information about a deep learning model with hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer. Instead, it discusses the use of Random Forest (RF) as a machine learning technique for classifying and estimating grassland characteristics.

In the context, the RF model's hyperparameters include the maximum shaft number value, minimum sample number, maximum tree depth, and minimum number of samples. The maximum shaft number value was tested from 1 to 100, and the minimum sample number from 1 to 50. The most accurate results for RF were obtained when the maximum tree depth was set to 10 and the minimum number of samples was set to 2.

The RF model was used for classification based on Red Green Blue (RGB) images acquired in March, April, and May. The model generated an impartial internal estimate of the generalization error by the "out-of-bag" (OOB) samples, which are those not included in the training subset.

Therefore, the hyperparameters mentioned in the context are specific to the Random Forest machine learning technique and not to a deep learning model.
