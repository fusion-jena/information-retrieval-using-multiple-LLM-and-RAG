The training of the model is completed when the validation loss remains constant for five epochs, leading to a reduction in the learning rate by a factor of 0.1 in a step-wise manner. This is a form of early stopping, where the model training is halted when the performance on a validation set does not improve for a certain number of epochs. This approach helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the model generalizes well to unseen data. The learning rate reduction also aids in fine-tuning the model's parameters during the later stages of training, allowing it to converge to a more optimal solution.
