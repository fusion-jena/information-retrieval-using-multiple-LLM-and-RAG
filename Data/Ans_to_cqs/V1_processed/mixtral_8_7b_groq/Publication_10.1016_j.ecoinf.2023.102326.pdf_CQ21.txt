Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, the text does mention some processes that could be considered part of the overall analysis flow.

After model training, the authors discuss the calculation of the Average Shortest Path Length (ASPL) and the creation of 95% Bootstrap intervals for each hour by device. This is done to analyze the network's topology and understand the connectivity patterns better. These steps can be seen as a form of metrics calculation, even though they are not specifically mentioned in the query.

Additionally, the authors create network representations from the Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) and adjacency matrices for specific Land Use Types (LUTs), such as "Main Street" and "Urban Forest". These steps help visualize and interpret the results of the model training.

Lastly, the authors suggest the possibility of analyzing networks at different time scales (e.g., days, weeks, or months) and building evolving networks to reveal transitions in the dynamics of the urban area. These steps could be considered part of the post-processing or analysis pipeline, even if they are not directly related to model training.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention postprocessing steps like Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix, it does discuss the calculation of ASPL, the creation of network representations, and the analysis of networks at different time scales. These steps can be seen as part of the overall analysis flow after model training.
