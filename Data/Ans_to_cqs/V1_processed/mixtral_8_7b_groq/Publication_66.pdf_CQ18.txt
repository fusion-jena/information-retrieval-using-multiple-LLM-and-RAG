The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using cross-validation techniques. Specifically, leave-one-out cross-validation was used for training the optimum models for guillemots, shags, and razorbills. This method involves using all but one of the observations to train the model, and then testing the model on the left-out observation. This process is repeated for each observation, providing a robust measure of the model's performance.

In addition to leave-one-out cross-validation, the performance of the models was also monitored using 10-fold cross-validation. This method involves dividing the data into 10 equal parts, or folds. The model is then trained on 9 of the folds and tested on the remaining fold. This process is repeated 10 times, with a different fold being used for testing each time.

The performance of the models was evaluated using several metrics, including training AUC (T_AUC), validation AUC (V_AUC), positive predicted value (PPV), and negative predicted value (NPV). The solid line in the middle of the boxes in the box plots represents the mean of these metrics.

It is worth noting that while there was variation in the optimum models between species, altitude and coverage together were also found to be good predictors of diving behavior in all species. This suggests that these two variables may be particularly important in predicting diving behavior.

Furthermore, to compare the predictions obtained from deep learning models with methods used in previous studies, a naive Bayes classifier and speed and tortuosity predictions were implemented on the data. The naive Bayes classifier is a supervised learning method that was implemented in R using the e1071 package. The inputs were the same as those used in the H2O model, and the dependent variable was the binary dive/not dive column.

Overall, the use of cross-validation techniques and the evaluation of model performance using multiple metrics allowed for the monitoring of model performance during training and ensured the selection of robust and accurate models for predicting diving behavior in seabirds.
