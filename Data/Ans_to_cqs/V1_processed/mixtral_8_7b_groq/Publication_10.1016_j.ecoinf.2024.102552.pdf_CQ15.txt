The provided context does not give specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of machine learning methods for classification, including "human in the loop" classification and the potential use of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for the four-band imagery to aid in classification. It's also mentioned that machine learning methods have great potential for automatic or supervised classification but are limited by the quality of their inputs.

Optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam are commonly used in deep learning pipelines for training models. SGD is an optimization algorithm used to minimize some function by iteratively moving in the direction of steepest descent as defined by the negative of the gradient. Adam is an optimization algorithm that is computationally efficient and has little memory requirement. It is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters.

It's possible that these optimization techniques or others were used in the machine learning methods mentioned in the context, but it is not explicitly stated. Without further information, it's not possible to provide a definitive answer.
