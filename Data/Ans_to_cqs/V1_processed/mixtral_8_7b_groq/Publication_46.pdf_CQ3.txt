The provided context does not include specific information about data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. However, it does discuss the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in processing multidimensional data, which typically relies on annotated data for training.

Common data annotation techniques used in deep learning, particularly for computer vision tasks, include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing a rectangle around an object of interest in an image. The coordinates of the rectangle's corners are then used as labels to train object detection models.
2. Instance segmentation: This is a more fine-grained annotation technique where each pixel of an object is labeled with the corresponding class. This method is used to train models for semantic segmentation and image segmentation tasks.
3. Scene segmentation: In this technique, an image is divided into different regions or segments, each representing a specific object class or background. It is used to train models for scene understanding and image classification tasks.
4. Landmark annotation: This technique involves identifying and labeling key points or landmarks on an object. It is used for training models in facial recognition, human pose estimation, and object tracking.
5. Text annotation: This technique involves annotating text data, such as labeling entities, parts of speech, or sentiment. It is used for training natural language processing models.

These annotation techniques are crucial for providing the necessary labeled data to train deep learning models effectively. The trained models can then be used for various applications, such as image recognition, object detection, and natural language processing.
