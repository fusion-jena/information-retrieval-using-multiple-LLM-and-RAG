Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of techniques such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting that were specifically used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some measures that were taken which can indirectly contribute to the model's generalizability.

Firstly, the model was trained and tested on two different datasets, Amazon and Cerrado, which could help to ensure that the model can generalize to different types of data. This is because the two datasets are from different geographical locations and may have different characteristics.

Secondly, the model was trained using a balanced number of samples per class, which can help to prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class. This is evident in Table 1 and Tables 6-7, where the number of training samples per class is kept constant for each scenario.

Thirdly, the model's performance was evaluated using not only Overall Accuracy (OA) but also F1-Score. F1-Score is a harmonic mean of precision and recall, which takes into account both false positives and false negatives. This can provide a more balanced and comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance than using Overall Accuracy alone.

Lastly, the model's hyperparameters were selected empirically using a validation set, which can help to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalizability. Specifically, the batch size, number of epochs, early stopping, dropout rate, optimizer, weight decay, and learning rate were all selected based on the model's performance on the validation set.

Therefore, while there is no explicit mention of techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting, the use of two different datasets, balanced class distribution, comprehensive evaluation metrics, and empirical hyperparameter tuning can all contribute to the generalizability of the deep learning model.
