Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention that the model's performance is measured in terms of accuracy and loss, which are calculated during the training process.

The context also discusses the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) with various hyperparameters, which are tuned using a search process involving global and local search phases. This process is designed to find the best set of hyperparameters that minimize the model's error or loss.

While the creation of saliency maps is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, it is a common postprocessing step used to visualize the regions of an input image that a trained model focuses on for making predictions.

Similarly, the calculation of metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score, as well as the creation of a confusion matrix, are also common postprocessing steps used to evaluate the performance of a trained model. These metrics provide a more detailed analysis of the model's performance than just accuracy and loss.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, it is reasonable to assume that steps such as calculating metrics, creating a confusion matrix, and generating saliency maps may be used to further analyze the performance of the trained model.
