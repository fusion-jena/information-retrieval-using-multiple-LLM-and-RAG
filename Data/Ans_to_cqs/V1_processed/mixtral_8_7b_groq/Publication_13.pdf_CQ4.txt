Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling being applied in the described deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the use of single-specimen photographs represented by local taxonomists to predict local high-resolution images and between-datasets classification using domain adversarial training. It also mentions the training of a source dataset to predict images from a different target dataset and the performance of within-dataset classification. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.
