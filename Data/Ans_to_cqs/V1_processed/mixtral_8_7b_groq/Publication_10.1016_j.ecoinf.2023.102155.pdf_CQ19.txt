Based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine which specific deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, are used to build the model. The context focuses on the ppmlasso package and related functions, which are used for regularization path analysis in spatial econometrics and do not involve deep learning.

The ppmlasso package is used for fitting spatial econometric models with a lasso penalty and bias correction. The package includes functions for fitting different types of models, such as the ppmlassoMixEngine and ppmlassoLoopEngine, which are based on the PPM model developed in Guilbault et al. (2021).

The arguments for these functions include spatial resolution, observer bias proxy, and the number of models to fit through the regularization path. However, there is no mention of deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query regarding which deep learning frameworks are used to build the model.
