I'm sorry for the confusion, but the context provided does not contain information about data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as Flipping, Rotating, or Scaling. The context consists of various research papers and websites related to urban areas, vegetation, land cover, wild rabbit conservation, and digital elevation models. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to your query.
