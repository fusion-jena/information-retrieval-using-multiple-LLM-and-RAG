The provided context does not give specific details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that the study was conducted using three tagging methods, one of which involved the use of a machine learning (ML) bounding box model for species-level classification.

The ML models used in the study were likely trained and then serialized, which is the process of converting the trained model into a format that can be stored and loaded again for deployment. Serialization allows the model to be deployed on different platforms without requiring the training process to be repeated.

The context does not provide information on the specific platform used for deployment, but it does mention that the study was conducted using ML techniques for remote wildlife monitoring. Therefore, it can be inferred that the ML model was deployed on a platform suitable for this application, such as a cloud-based server or an edge device located in the field.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, it can be inferred that the model was likely serialized for storage and deployment on a suitable platform for remote wildlife monitoring.
