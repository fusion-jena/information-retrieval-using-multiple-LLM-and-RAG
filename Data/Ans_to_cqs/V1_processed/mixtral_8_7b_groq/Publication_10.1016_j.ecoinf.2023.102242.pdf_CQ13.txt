I'm sorry for any confusion, but the provided context does not include information about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context focuses on a study of ecological informatics, which involves figures and tables related to data processing, field survey data, and multi-level segmentation parameters for different land categories and scales. Therefore, I'm unable to provide an answer to the query based on the given information.
