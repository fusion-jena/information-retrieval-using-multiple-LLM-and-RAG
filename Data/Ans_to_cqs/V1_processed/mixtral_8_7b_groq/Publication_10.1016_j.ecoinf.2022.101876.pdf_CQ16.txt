Based on the provided context, there are no specific details about the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. However, the context does provide a list of performance measures and equations that are used to evaluate the performance of a model. These measures include accuracy (ACC), error rate (ERR), false discovery rate (FDR), false omission rate (FOR), F1 score, Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), true negative rate (TNR), false positive rate (FPR), false negative rate (FNR), positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV).

It is possible that the criteria for determining when training is complete is not specified in the given context because the focus is on the performance evaluation of the model rather than the training process. In general, training of a machine learning model is considered complete when the model's performance on a validation set stops improving or when the model begins to overfit to the training data.

Therefore, while the provided context does not give a specific answer to the query, it can be inferred that the criteria for determining when training is complete could include monitoring the model's performance on a validation set and stopping the training process when the performance stops improving or when overfitting is observed.
