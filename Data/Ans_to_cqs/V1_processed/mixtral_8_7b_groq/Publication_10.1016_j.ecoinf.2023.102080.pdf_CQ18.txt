The provided context does not give direct information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does offer some insights into the evaluation of model performance after training.

The study compares three main covariate selection procedures - "embedded", "filter", and "random" - and their impact on model accuracy and computation time. The model accuracy is assessed using a composite score that combines Somersâ€™ D, True Skill Statistic, and the continuous Boyce index. This score is calculated for each modelling algorithm (GLM, GAM, and RF) and for different subsets of species based on their number of records and spatial coverage.

The computation time is also compared for each covariate selection procedure and modelling algorithm. The overall computation time for running both the covariate selection procedure and model fitting steps is found to be higher with the embedded procedure, but the models from this procedure are faster to fit, presumably because the more relevant the covariate set, the faster the algorithms converge.

While these evaluations are done after the training process, they do provide some indirect insights into the monitoring of model performance during training. For instance, the continuous evaluation of the model's convergence rate during training could be an indicator of the model's performance. Similarly, the tracking of the covariate set's relevance could provide insights into the model's ability to learn from the training data.

However, without explicit information in the provided context, it is not possible to give a definitive answer to the query.
