The purpose of using deep learning models, as mentioned in the context, is for the automated classification of bioacoustic data. Deep learning models, such as neural networks, have shown great promise in classifying large datasets of various taxa, including marine mammals. These models typically require significant sample sizes for all classes to ensure accurate classification.

Deep learning models are particularly useful in bioacoustic classification because they can learn complex patterns and representations from raw data without the need for extensive feature engineering. This ability to learn directly from data makes deep learning models suitable for handling large and high-dimensional datasets.

In the context of marine mammal classification, deep learning models can be trained to identify and categorize different species based on their unique acoustic signatures, such as echolocation clicks or vocalizations. For instance, Soldevilla et al. (2008) used spectral properties of echolocation clicks to classify Risso's and Pacific white-sided dolphins. Deep learning models can potentially improve the efficiency, reduce the subjectivity, and decrease the cost of analyzing such large bioacoustic datasets.

Some deep learning models specifically designed for classification tasks include convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). These models can be further optimized for specific classification problems by employing techniques such as data augmentation, transfer learning, or ensemble methods.

Deep learning models can also be used for other tasks in bioacoustic analysis, such as segmentation and detection. Segmentation involves dividing a continuous signal into smaller, meaningful segments, while detection refers to identifying the presence or absence of a specific pattern or event within a signal. However, the context provided does not explicitly mention the use of deep learning models for these specific tasks in the context of bioacoustic analysis.

In summary, the purpose of deep learning models in the given context is for the automated classification of bioacoustic data, specifically for marine mammal identification based on their acoustic signatures. These models can potentially be used for other tasks such as segmentation and detection, but the context does not provide specific information regarding these applications.
