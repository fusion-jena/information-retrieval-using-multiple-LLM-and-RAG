The text provided does not give a detailed description of the strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention the use of an improved KNN algorithm for segmentation of individual mangrove trees using LiDAR data.

In the context of machine learning, model performance can be monitored during training using various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics are calculated based on the true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN) values.

In the given table, the FN, FP, R (recall), P (precision), and F (F1 score) values are provided for different sample areas. These metrics can be used to monitor the model performance during training for each sample area.

Moreover, the KNN algorithm is a type of instance-based learning algorithm that classifies new instances based on a similarity measure (e.g., distance functions) with training data. The improved KNN algorithm used in this study might have some modifications to enhance the performance, such as distance metric optimization, feature selection, or weighting schemes.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the strategy to monitor the model performance during training might include calculating and tracking the aforementioned evaluation metrics for each sample area and iteratively adjusting the parameters of the improved KNN algorithm to optimize its performance.

However, without more specific information about the training process and the improvements made to the KNN algorithm, it is challenging to provide a more detailed answer.
