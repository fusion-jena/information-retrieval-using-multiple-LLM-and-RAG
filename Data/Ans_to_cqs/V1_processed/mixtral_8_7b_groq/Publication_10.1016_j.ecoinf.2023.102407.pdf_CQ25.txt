The purpose of the deep learning model in the context of species distribution modeling is to improve the performance and robustness of predicting the presence or absence of a target species based on environmental data. This is achieved by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data in a semi-supervised learning (SSL) approach.

In this context, the deep learning model is not specifically for classification, segmentation, or detection tasks as in traditional computer vision problems. Instead, it focuses on learning the complex relationships between the environmental variables and the presence or absence of the target species.

Given an environmental dataset X and an observational dataset Y, the deep learning model aims to learn from both the labeled data points DL and the unlabeled data points DU. The labeled data points DL consist of data points (xi, yi) where xi describes the environmental information for site i, and yi indicates whether the target species is present at site i. The unlabeled data points DU consist of data points (xi, yi) where yi is unknown.

The deep learning model can benefit from the unlabeled data points DU by using pseudo-labeling techniques. Pseudo-labeling is a simple and efficient semi-supervised learning method for deep neural networks. In the context of species distribution modeling, a pseudo-labeling technique can be used to generate labels for the unlabeled data points DU by using a trained teacher model. This teacher model can be a single ANN or deep neural network model, or multiple teacher models can be considered for label generation.

The use of multiple teacher models can help alleviate the bias towards specific environmental data and the accumulation of predictive errors that can occur when using a single-teacher model. By considering different teacher models for label generation and using the most promising model, the deep learning model can learn from a more diverse set of labeled data points and improve its general efficiency.

In summary, the deep learning model in species distribution modeling aims to improve the performance and robustness of predicting the presence or absence of a target species by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data in a semi-supervised learning approach. Pseudo-labeling techniques and the use of multiple teacher models can help improve the model's learning from a diverse set of labeled data points and increase its predictive accuracy.
