Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for the pest damage classification model. The model uses a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) algorithm for determining the degree of damage due to Erannis jacobsoni Djak. (EJD) on forest trees. However, the context does not mention any optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, or others.

The context does mention that a sensitivity analysis of the spectral vegetation indices was performed using SPA (successive projections algorithm) and the analyzed data were used to determine the degree of damage due to EJD via the 1D-CNN neural network algorithm. But, SPA is a feature selection method and not an optimization technique for deep learning models.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to provide information on the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
