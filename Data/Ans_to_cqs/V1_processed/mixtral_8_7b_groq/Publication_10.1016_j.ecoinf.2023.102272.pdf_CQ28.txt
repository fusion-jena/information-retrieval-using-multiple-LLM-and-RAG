The provided context does not contain information about the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The text focuses on the data, parameters, and procedure used for training and selecting the deep learning model, specifically a deep neural network (DNN). It mentions the use of the R programming language and the dismo package for data partitioning, as well as the deepnet package for deep learning. However, it does not specify the platform used for deployment. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
