Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it is mentioned that the study involves a model with various indicators and the use of SHAP values (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for interpretation. SHAP values are a method used to explain the output of a machine learning model by quantifying the importance of each input feature (in this case, study indicators).

In the context of machine learning model training, determining when training is complete often involves monitoring the model's performance on a validation dataset during the training process. Common criteria for determining training completion include:

1. Validation loss plateau: Training is considered complete when the validation loss (a measure of the difference between the model's predictions and the actual values) stops decreasing or shows only minor fluctuations over a certain number of epochs (iterations through the training dataset).
2. Early stopping: A technique used to prevent overfitting by stopping the training process when the validation loss starts to increase, even if the training loss continues to decrease.
3. Convergence: Training is complete when the model's weights or parameters have stabilized, and the changes in these values between iterations are very small.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention these criteria, it is possible that they were used in the training process. To provide a definitive answer, additional information about the training procedure would be required.
