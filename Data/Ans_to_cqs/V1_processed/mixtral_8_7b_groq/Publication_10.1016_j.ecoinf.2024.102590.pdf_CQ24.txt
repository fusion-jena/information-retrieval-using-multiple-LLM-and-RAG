The provided context discusses the methodology of a supervised learning study, specifically focusing on the creation of training and validation points for a Random Forest classifier used to obtain a woody cover classification. However, the text does not directly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value.

Deep learning pipelines often involve randomness in various stages, like weight initialization, dropout, data shuffling, and batch sampling. A random seed value ensures reproducibility by determining the initial random state, allowing consistent results when running the model multiple times.

In the context provided, the study uses randomness in two ways:

1. Generating a set of 400 random points within the subplot for training and validation purposes.
2. Utilizing the Random Forest classifier, which builds multiple decision trees using a randomly selected subset of training data and independent variables.

However, the context does not mention the use of a random seed value to control the randomness in these processes. It is possible that the researchers did not explicitly specify the use of a seed value in the text, or they might have relied on the default settings of their software, which could include a random seed. Nonetheless, the provided context does not offer enough information to answer the query regarding strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value.
