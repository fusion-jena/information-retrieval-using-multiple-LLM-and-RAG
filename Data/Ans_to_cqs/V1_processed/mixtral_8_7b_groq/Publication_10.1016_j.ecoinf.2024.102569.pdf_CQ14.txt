The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific method used to optimize the hyperparameters of the model, such as the tuning parameter ϕ in the penalized loss function. However, it does mention the use of cross-validation, which is a common method for hyperparameter optimization.

The Root Trimmed Mean Squared Prediction Error (RTMSPE) is used to select the appropriate values for the tuning parameters τ and ϕ. The RTMSPE is a robust measure of the model's predictive performance, which trims a certain proportion of observations with the largest squared residuals. The value of δ in the RTMSPE is set to represent the expected proportion of heterogeneous observations.

The context also suggests that the RTMSPE can be calculated using a validation dataset that is independent of the training dataset. However, due to computational cost, the RTMSPE is calculated using the training data in the study.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the hyperparameters of the model may have been optimized using cross-validation, where the model is trained on different subsets of the training data, and the hyperparameters are selected based on the RTMSPE calculated on the remaining subset. However, the specific method of hyperparameter optimization is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
