The raw data in the deep learning pipeline for counting wildebeest in aerial images is collected through surveys using the online platform Zooniverse, where multiple non-expert counts by citizen scientists are gathered. Three different aggregation methods are then used to obtain a single count for the survey images. Additionally, a deep learning method is developed through the use of a convolutional neural network to count the images. The results of both approaches are compared after filtering of the citizen science counts.

The study highlights that both methods provided highly accurate total estimates, with the deep learning method being faster and more reliable. However, it is noted that citizen science volunteers played an important role in creating training data for the algorithm. The research concludes that accurate, species-specific, automated counting of aerial wildlife images is now possible, and deep learning algorithms can replace manual counters, removing a significant burden from conservation organizations.

In terms of data collection for the deep learning pipeline, the study does not explicitly mention the use of public datasets or sensors. However, it is noted that the algorithm employed crowd-sourced data to create the training sets. Therefore, it can be inferred that citizen science data is used as the foundation for the automated algorithm. Furthermore, the study suggests that combining state-of-the-art deep learning methods with validated crowd-sourced training data can ensure the availability of sufficient training data for automated wildlife counts as emerging image collection technologies are leveraged.
