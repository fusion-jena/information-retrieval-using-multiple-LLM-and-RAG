The provided context does not specify a particular type of deep learning model used in the mentioned pipelines for atmospheric correction or land use/land cover classification. However, it does mention the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in some studies.

In the study by Men et al., 2022, an ANN is used for atmospheric correction of HY-1C CZI images in the western Pacific region. Similarly, Kumar and Gorai (2023) compare the performance of a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) with a deep neural network (DNN) for land use/land cover classification in mining regions using fused multi-sensor satellite data.

Moreover, Meng et al. (2024) use CNNs for classification of inland lake water quality levels based on Sentinel-2 images. They also analyze the spatiotemporal variation and driving factors of algal bloom.

While these studies utilize deep learning models, they do not represent the exclusive deep learning models used in the field. Other models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or Transformers, might be employed in different research contexts. Unfortunately, the provided context does not contain sufficient information to determine the usage of RNNs or Transformers in the related studies.
