Based on the provided context, there is no explicit description of the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it can be inferred that cross-validation and the use of statistical measures such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and nugget ratio were employed to assess the model's performance.

Cross-validation is a technique used to estimate the skill of a model by dividing the dataset into subsets, training the model on a portion of the data, and then testing it on the remaining portion. This process is repeated for each subset, providing an estimate of the model's performance across the entire dataset.

The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is a measure of the difference between predicted and actual values. In this case, the RMSE of residuals with a kriging variance of 1.04 indicates the model's ability to predict TSP (Total Soil Phosphorus) concentrations. A lower RMSE value indicates a better fit of the model to the data.

The nugget ratio, calculated as the ratio of the nugget variance (the variance of the data at very short distances) to the sill variance (the total variance of the data), provides information about the spatial dependency of the data. A high nugget ratio indicates strong spatial variability, while a low nugget ratio suggests weak spatial dependency. In this study, the nugget ratio for agricultural land use (14.2%) revealed a substantial geographical dependency, while a TSP ratio of 76.2% for mixed land use indicated a weak dependency.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly describe the strategy used to monitor the model performance during training, it can be inferred that cross-validation, RMSE, and nugget ratio were used to assess the model's performance. The extensive sampling employed in the study also contributed to reducing sample error and increasing the Kriging accuracy.
