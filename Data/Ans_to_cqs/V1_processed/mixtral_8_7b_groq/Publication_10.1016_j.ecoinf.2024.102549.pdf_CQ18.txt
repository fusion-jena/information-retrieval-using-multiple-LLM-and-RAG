In the study conducted by Cao, H., Han, L., Li, L., 2022, a strategy to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of a deep learning method for cyanobacterial harmful algae blooms prediction in Taihu Lake, China. The model used in this study is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) structure, which comprises five convolutional layers, one pooling layer, three fully connected layers, and three water-quality level labels.

To monitor the model's performance during training, the researchers implemented a technique of halving the learning rate every 20 rounds, optimizing performance, and selecting the most effective model weights for each cycle. This strategy allows for the continuous evaluation of the model's performance, enabling adjustments to be made as necessary to improve the model's accuracy.

Furthermore, the researchers incorporated a dropout function between the fully connected layers to enhance model reliability. The dropout function randomly sets a fraction rate of input units to 0 at each update during training time, which helps prevent overfitting and improves the model's ability to generalize.

The training was conducted over 500 epochs with a batch size of 4, momentum at 0.9, and an initial learning rate of 10. The learning rate was halved every 20 rounds, which helped the model converge faster and more accurately.

Therefore, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of a dynamic learning rate, dropout function, and continuous evaluation of the model's performance, enabling adjustments to be made as necessary to improve the model's accuracy.
