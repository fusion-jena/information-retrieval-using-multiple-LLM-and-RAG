The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, specifically for the EF network architecture, is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the Amazon database is split into training, validation, and test sets, with 78,431 balanced samples for training, 39,697 balanced samples for validation, and 1,716,000 total samples for testing. The Cerrado database also has a similar split, but the exact numbers are not provided.

In addition, the training set is further divided into scenarios for evaluating the influence of the number of training samples. For the Amazon database, the scenarios considered are collecting samples from the training set of one, two, three, and four tiles, denoted as N1, N2, N3, and N4. The number of training samples in each scenario for the Amazon and Cerrado databases is presented in Tables 6 and 7, respectively.

It is important to note that the validation set (val) is used for early stopping in the EF and SN methods, while for CSVM and SVM, the samples in this set are added to the training set (tr).

Therefore, while the exact criteria for splitting the data for training, validation, and testing are not provided, it is clear that the Amazon and Cerrado databases are split into these three sets, and the training set is further divided into scenarios for evaluating the influence of the number of training samples.
