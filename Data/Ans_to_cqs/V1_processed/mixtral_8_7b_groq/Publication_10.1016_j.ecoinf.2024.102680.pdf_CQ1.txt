The provided context does not discuss specific methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of underwater optical images for training deep learning models. Therefore, we can infer that the raw data for these models is likely collected through underwater surveys or the use of specialized sensors.

Underwater surveys can be conducted using remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) or autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) equipped with cameras and other sensors to collect data. These surveys can cover a wide range of depths and environments, from shallow coastal waters to the deep ocean.

Specialized sensors for underwater data collection can include cameras, sonar, and other acoustic sensors. Cameras can be used to capture high-resolution images of underwater objects and scenes, while sonar and other acoustic sensors can be used to map the seafloor and detect objects in the water column.

Public datasets of underwater optical images may also be used as raw data for deep learning models. These datasets can be collected through various means, including surveys and sensors, and are often made available for research and development purposes.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, we can infer that underwater surveys and specialized sensors are likely used for collecting optical images. Public datasets may also be used as a source of raw data.
