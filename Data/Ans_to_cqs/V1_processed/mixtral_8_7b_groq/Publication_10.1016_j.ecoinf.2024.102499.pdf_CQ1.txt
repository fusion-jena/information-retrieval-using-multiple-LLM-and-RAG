The papers provided do not give a detailed description of the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, they do mention the types of data used in their studies.

In the study by Oomen et al. (2022), it can be inferred that the data used is related to marine ecology, as the paper discusses the potential of deep learning for this field. The study by Graham et al. (2010) used data from reef shark surveys in remote atolls. 

The studies by Hammerschlag et al. (2019), Jalal et al. (2020), Jenrette et al. (2022), and Jorgensen et al. (2022) used data from baited underwater videos. Specifically, Jorgensen et al. (2022) used video clips from Baited Remote Underwater Video Stations (BRUVS) for their study. 

In the study by Jenrette et al. (2022), the raw data was collected through baited underwater videos, which were then transformed into still images at a rate of 1 frame per second. These images were then annotated with bounding boxes to identify and classify sharks and non-shark species. 

Therefore, it can be concluded that surveys, specifically baited underwater videos, and sensors, such as cameras, are used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for marine ecology studies. Additionally, public datasets may also be used, although this is not explicitly mentioned in the provided papers.
