Based on the provided context, there is no information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study by Navares and Aznarte (2020) titled "Predicting air quality with deep learning LSTM: Towards comprehensive models". The study discusses the development of a deep learning model for predicting air quality, but there is no mention of the code repository or where it can be accessed.

It is possible that the code was not made publicly available by the authors, or it may be hosted on a platform other than GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. If you are interested in accessing the code, it may be worth reaching out to the authors directly to inquire about its availability.

Additionally, the other studies provided in the context do not mention the code repository for any deep learning pipelines used in their research.
