The code repository for the deep learning pipeline is available on GitHub. You can access it using the following link: <https://github.com/pjsoto/IFREMER-ABYSSES.git>. This repository contains the implementation of the deep learning pipeline inspired by the VGG network, which has demonstrated improved classification accuracy through increased network depth. The repository also includes the architecture described in Section 7 of the work, which consists of 14 layers (13 convolutional and one dense layer) designed for image classification tasks.
