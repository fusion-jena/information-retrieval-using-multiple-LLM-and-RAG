Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, there is some information about the datasets used in the hand-crafted feature extraction experiment, which can give us some insights.

In the hand-crafted feature extraction experiment, two types of datasets were used: a biased dataset and an unbiased dataset. The biased dataset was created by randomly taking 70% of the data in dataset D for training and 30% for testing, while the unbiased dataset was created by trying to approximate a 70%-30% distribution for each species in dataset D, but placing images from the same specimen in either the training dataset or the testing dataset to avoid the same species, same photo bias (SSPB). This shows that some effort was made to create a more diverse and unbiased dataset in the hand-crafted feature extraction experiment.

As for the deep learning experiment, the context only mentions that there is no segmentation applied to the data, and only a resize to 224x224 pixels before running the network on the data. However, it is possible that a more diverse and unbiased dataset was used in this experiment as well, although this is not explicitly stated.

Therefore, while there is no explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the hand-crafted feature extraction experiment suggests that some effort was made to create a diverse and unbiased dataset. It is possible that similar measures were taken in the deep learning experiment, but this is not certain based on the provided context.
