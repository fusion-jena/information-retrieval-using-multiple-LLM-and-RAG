I'm sorry for the confusion, but the provided context does not contain information about regularization methods used in deep learning to prevent overfitting, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context focuses on downscaling forest biomass density, its spatial distribution, and validation methods. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to your query based on the given information.
