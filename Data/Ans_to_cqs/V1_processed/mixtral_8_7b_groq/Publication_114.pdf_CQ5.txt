Based on the provided context, the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for remote sensing applications are not explicitly mentioned. However, it is mentioned that for training and testing of deep learning approaches in remote sensing fields, there are benchmark datasets publicly available.

In the context of remote sensing, the authors used tree samples in the form of patches for training a deep learning network to classify tree species. To increase the amount of tree species samples, they performed data augmentation on the tree samples by rotating, mirroring, and flipping them randomly. A total of 5664 tree samples were used for CNN training. Scattered samples and tree samples in 12 plots surveyed in the field measurements were used for test and tree species classification accuracy assessment. The 12 plots were also used for diversity mapping assessment.

Therefore, while the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for remote sensing applications are not explicitly mentioned, it is clear that the authors used tree samples in the form of patches for training their deep learning network.
