The text provided does not give specific information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. Data augmentation is a common technique used in machine learning to increase the amount of training data by applying various transformations to the existing data, such as flipping, rotating, and scaling images or audio signals. This can help improve the model's ability to generalize and reduce overfitting.

However, the text only mentions that the audio files are segmented into 15-second windows and then passed to a feature extractor function that uses Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) to extract features for the classifier. There is no explicit mention of any data augmentation techniques used in the pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer this question.
