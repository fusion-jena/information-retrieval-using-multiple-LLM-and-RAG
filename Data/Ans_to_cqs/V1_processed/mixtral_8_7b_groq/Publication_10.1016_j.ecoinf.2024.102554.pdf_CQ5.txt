Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline discussed in the article does not seem to involve any of the commonly used datasets in machine learning research such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The focus of the study is on using a crawling tool to gather historical and near real-time data from different SRS (Sentinel-3 Radiometer System) products. The data is stored in NetCDF files, which are sourced from either ESA (European Space Agency) or NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration).

The SRS data includes vital parameters such as reflectance, Aerosol Optical Thickness (Kd940), and Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations. These parameters are obtained from the processing of satellite images from the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) sensor and the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). The study primarily focuses on Sentinel-3-related products as they offer daily data from the same world region around the same hour, which is essential for the development of a monitoring system.

Therefore, the datasets used in this deep learning pipeline are not MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet but rather historical and near real-time SRS data obtained from ESA and NASA satellite sensors.
