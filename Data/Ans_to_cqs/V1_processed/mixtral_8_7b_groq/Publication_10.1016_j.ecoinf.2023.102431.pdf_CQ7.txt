The criteria used to split the data for training, testing, and validation of a deep learning model are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the data was split for discriminant analysis of species and sex in the context of tracking data for martens and fishers.

For species discrimination, the training, validation, and test samples consisted of 82, 43, and 42 tracks for martens, and 184, 92, and 91 tracks for fishers, respectively. For sex discrimination, the training, validation, and test samples consisted of 42, 43, and 42 tracks for male and female martens, and 91, 92, and 99 tracks for male and female fishers, respectively.

Additionally, the total number of individuals and tracks, as well as the number of male and female individuals and tracks, are provided for each group.

It is important to note that the data splitting criteria used in the context of discriminant analysis may not be directly applicable to deep learning models. In deep learning, data splitting is typically done using random sampling techniques, such as k-fold cross-validation, to ensure that the model is trained, validated, and tested on diverse and representative subsets of the data.

Therefore, while the specific criteria used for data splitting in the context of discriminant analysis are provided, they should not be directly applied to deep learning models without considering the unique requirements and best practices for deep learning data splitting.
