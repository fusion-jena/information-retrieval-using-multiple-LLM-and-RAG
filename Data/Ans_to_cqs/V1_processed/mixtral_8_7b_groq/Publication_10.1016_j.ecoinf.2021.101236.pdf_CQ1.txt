The provided context does not give specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for bird species classification. However, it does mention that data augmentation is used during the training phase, which implies that the original raw data is likely diversified through techniques such as adding noise, flipping, or rotating the spectrograms.

The raw data used in this study is most likely collected through a combination of surveys, sensors, and potentially public datasets. For instance, ornithologists and conservation biologists might conduct surveys to collect audio recordings of bird species in their natural habitats. These audio recordings can then be processed to extract spectrograms, which serve as input to the deep learning model.

Additionally, sensors such as microphones or audio recorders could be deployed in specific locations to continuously record bird sounds. These recordings can then be post-processed and used as raw data for training the deep learning model.

Lastly, public datasets of bird sounds and corresponding annotations might also be utilized as raw data. These datasets can be particularly useful for increasing the diversity of the training data and improving the generalization capabilities of the model.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data, it is likely that a combination of surveys, sensors, and public datasets are used to gather the audio recordings, which are then transformed into spectrograms for use in the deep learning pipeline.
