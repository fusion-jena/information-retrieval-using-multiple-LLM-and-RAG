The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline involve randomly deforming input images during each training cycle. However, the context does not provide specific details about the types of transformations used, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, while we know that data augmentation was used, the specific methods remain unspecified.
