The context provided does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model in question. However, it is mentioned that a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture was used for the study, which is a type of deep learning-based model. CNNs typically require significant computational power for training, and it is common to use specialized hardware such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) to accelerate the training process. GPUs are particularly well-suited for the type of matrix and vector operations that are prevalent in deep learning algorithms. TPUs, on the other hand, are custom-built by Google for machine learning tasks and can deliver higher performance than GPUs for certain types of workloads. Therefore, it is likely that either GPUs or TPUs were used for training the CNN model in this study, but the context does not provide enough information to make a definitive conclusion.
