In the deep learning pipeline for fish detection and species classification in underwater environments, the data annotation technique used is bounding box annotation (Jalal et al., 2020). This method involves drawing rectangular boxes around the target objects (sharks and non-shark species) in the video frames to indicate their location and size. By annotating the species with bounding boxes, the model can learn to recognize and classify the different species based on their distinctive features.

The training data for the model included 8 shark species and 19 non-shark species, resulting in a total of 26,947 fish annotations (Jalal et al., 2020). However, some shark species that were infrequently captured in the video clips were excluded from the testing phase. The annotated dataset is presented in Table 1, which shows the number of annotations, frames, and clips for each species.

The deep learning models used in this study employed the NASnet architecture with a Faster-rcnn backbone, implemented in Tensorflow2 (Jalal et al., 2020). The NASnet architecture is a neural architecture search method that automatically generates the optimal architecture for a given task (Zoph et al., 2017). The Faster-rcnn backbone is a region-based convolutional neural network that is widely used for object detection tasks (Ren et al., 2015).

The images used in the training phase were resized to 1333 × 800 pixels to match the pre-training data used to prepare the first layers of the model (Jalal et al., 2020). This step was taken to save computing time during the training phase. The learning rate used in the training phase was 0.008 with a cosine learning rate decay. The model was trained for 200,000 iterations with a batch size of 16 images per iteration.

To evaluate the performance of the deep learning models, the recall, precision, and F-measure were computed for each model (Jalal et al., 2020). These metrics are commonly used to assess the accuracy of object detection models.

This method involves drawing rectangular boxes around the target objects in the video frames to indicate their location and size.
