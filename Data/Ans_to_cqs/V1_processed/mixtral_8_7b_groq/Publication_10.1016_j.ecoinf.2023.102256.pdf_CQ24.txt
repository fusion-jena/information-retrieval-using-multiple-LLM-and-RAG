Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, the text does discuss the use of a baseline model with a simple CNN architecture for bird classification. This baseline model is trained on a relatively small number of examples, which is common in ecology datasets.

In order to enhance the neural network with contextual information, the authors explore and test different methods, including the use of a multi-branch CNN. This approach is investigated as an initial method to integrate additional information into the deep learning classifier while maintaining model simplicity.

While these methods do not directly address the handling of randomness in the deep learning pipeline, they do demonstrate the importance of careful model design and the integration of contextual information in improving model performance, especially when training on small datasets.
