The provided context does not include information about any deep learning model or the metrics used to evaluate its performance. The text focuses on the use of complex network measures, specifically the Average Shortest Path Length (ASPL), to analyze the urban acoustic environment (AE). The ASPL is calculated for different land use types and devices, and 95% Bootstrap intervals for each hour by device are provided in a figure. The analyses were performed using Python 3.8.5 and corresponding packages, and the code, dataset, and documentation are available on GitHub. However, there is no mention of a deep learning model or the metrics used to evaluate its performance. Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query.
