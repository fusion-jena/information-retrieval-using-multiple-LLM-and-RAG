The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of an evaluation method called the "Elbow method." This method is used to determine the optimal number of freshness classes for each fish species. The Elbow method works by applying the evaluation scores from three different methods to the results obtained from the Elbow method. The Elbow method identifies a point where diminishing returns no longer justify the increased expense, using the "elbow" as a cutoff point.

Additionally, the model's performance is monitored during the training phase by evaluating the clustering results. Clustering divides data into groups based on inherent characteristics, without requiring external information. The evaluation of clustering results is conducted internally, using Silhouette and Calinski-Harabasz methods. High evaluation scores on both methods indicate that the clustering results obtained by the clustering method are the best outcome.

Furthermore, the strategy includes the use of a clustering approach to experiment with the number and range of freshness classes. For each fish, the number of classes and their duration are automatically identified, and their significance is evaluated using the Elbow method. The most suitable number of clusters from the previous stage is used as the standard for the proposed number of freshness classes. Each species attains several freshness classes based on its freshness stronghold, and the data is grouped using the clustering method to automatically determine freshness class based on the dataset.

In summary, the strategy to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of the Elbow method, evaluating clustering results, and using a clustering approach to determine the optimal number of freshness classes. The significant prevalence of automatic computing minimizes subjectivity, enhancing the objectivity of the findings.
