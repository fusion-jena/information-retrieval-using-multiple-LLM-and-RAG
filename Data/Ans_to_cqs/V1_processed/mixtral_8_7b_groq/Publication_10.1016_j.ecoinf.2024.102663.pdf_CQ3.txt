The provided context discusses the use of deep learning for fish biomass estimation in turbid environments, but it does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does imply the use of object detection techniques, such as bounding box annotation, as it mentions the extraction of fish from the background and the calculation of their size.

Object detection is a common computer vision task that involves detecting instances of objects in an image and drawing a bounding box around each instance. This technique is often used in deep learning-based methods for object detection, such as YOLO (You Only Look Once), which is mentioned in the context.

Another data annotation technique that could be used in the deep learning pipeline for fish biomass estimation is instance segmentation. This technique involves not only detecting the objects in an image but also segmenting each instance from the background and other instances. This could provide more precise measurements of the fish and improve the accuracy of the biomass estimates.

In addition, the context mentions the use of Bidirectional LSTM with GloVe embeddings, which could be used for text annotation in the deep learning pipeline. GloVe is a pre-trained word embedding model that can be used to represent text data as numerical vectors, and Bidirectional LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network that can be used for sequence-to-sequence tasks, such as text classification or caption generation.

Overall, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for fish biomass estimation, it does imply the use of object detection techniques, such as bounding box annotation, and suggests the possibility of using other techniques, such as instance segmentation and text annotation.
