Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, generally, in deep learning model training, the data is typically split into three sets: training, validation, and testing.

The training set is used to train the model by adjusting the model's parameters to minimize the error or loss function. The validation set is used to tune the hyperparameters of the model and prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model learns the training data too well, including its noise, and performs poorly on unseen data. The testing set is used to evaluate the final performance of the trained model on unseen data.

The criteria used to split the data into these three sets can vary depending on the specific problem and dataset. A common approach is to randomly split the data into training, validation, and testing sets with a ratio of 70-15-15 or 80-10-10. However, for some applications, such as medical diagnosis or autonomous driving, where the dataset is limited, a stratified sampling method can be used to ensure that each set has a similar distribution of classes or labels.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, generally, the data is split into training, validation, and testing sets. The criteria used to split the data can vary depending on the specific problem and dataset, and common approaches include random splitting or stratified sampling.
