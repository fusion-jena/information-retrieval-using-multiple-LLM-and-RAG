The provided context discusses the use of deep learning techniques in ecological research, particularly in the field of fisheries. It highlights the importance of data representation and the use of existing deep learning techniques to address limitations in dataset size. However, it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.

That being said, there are several techniques commonly used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. These include:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into subsets based on certain criteria (such as class labels) to ensure that each subset is representative of the overall dataset. This can help to ensure that the training, validation, and testing sets are balanced and that the model is not biased towards any particular class.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of instances in the minority class to balance the dataset. This can be done by duplicating instances or by generating synthetic instances using techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of instances in the majority class to balance the dataset. This can be done by randomly selecting a subset of instances or by using more sophisticated techniques such as Tomek links.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from a variety of sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population being studied. This can help to reduce bias and improve the generalizability of the model.

It's important to note that the choice of technique will depend on the specific dataset and the research question being addressed. Additionally, it's important to consider the trade-offs between bias and variance when selecting a technique. For example, oversampling can help to reduce bias but may increase variance, while undersampling can help to reduce variance but may increase bias.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, there are several commonly used techniques that can help to reduce bias and improve the performance of the model. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. The choice of technique will depend on the specific dataset and the research question being addressed.
