The text provided does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention two sources of data used in the study: USGS Earth Explorer (earthexplorer.usgs.gov) and OpenStreetMap (www.openstreetmap.org). 

USGS Earth Explorer is a data and information service provided by the United States Geological Survey, which offers a wide variety of satellite and aerial imagery, lidar data, and other geospatial data. This suggests that the study may have used remote sensing data, such as satellite or aerial images, as part of its deep learning pipeline.

OpenStreetMap is a free, editable map of the world created and maintained by volunteers. It provides geospatial data in the form of vector features, such as points, lines, and polygons, that represent various features on the Earth's surface, such as buildings, roads, rivers, and land use. This suggests that the study may have also used vector data from OpenStreetMap as part of its deep learning pipeline.

It is important to note that the deep learning pipeline may involve multiple methods for collecting raw data, including but not limited to surveys, sensors, and public datasets. The text provided does not give enough information to determine all the methods used in this study.
