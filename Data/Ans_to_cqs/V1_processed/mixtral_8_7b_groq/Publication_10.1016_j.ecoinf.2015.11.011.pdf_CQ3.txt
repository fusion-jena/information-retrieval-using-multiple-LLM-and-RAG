The provided context discusses the use of image processing and machine learning techniques for analyzing remote sensing data, but it does not specifically mention the data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.

However, I can provide some general information about data annotation techniques that are commonly used in deep learning pipelines for computer vision tasks.

In the context of deep learning for computer vision, data annotation refers to the process of labeling images or video frames with relevant information that can be used to train machine learning models. There are several data annotation techniques that are commonly used, including:

1. Image classification: This involves labeling an image with a single class or category. For example, an image of a dog might be labeled as "dog."
2. Object detection: This involves drawing bounding boxes around objects in an image and labeling each box with the corresponding class. For example, an image of a park might have bounding boxes around trees, cars, and people, each labeled with the corresponding class.
3. Semantic segmentation: This involves dividing an image into multiple regions or segments, each of which is labeled with a corresponding class. For example, an image of a cityscape might be divided into segments for buildings, roads, and trees, each labeled with the corresponding class.
4. Instance segmentation: This is a more advanced form of semantic segmentation that involves identifying and segmenting individual instances of objects within an image. For example, an image of a group of people might be segmented into individual instances of each person, with each instance labeled with the corresponding class.

These data annotation techniques are used to create labeled datasets that can be used to train deep learning models for various computer vision tasks. The choice of data annotation technique depends on the specific task and the desired level of detail in the output.
