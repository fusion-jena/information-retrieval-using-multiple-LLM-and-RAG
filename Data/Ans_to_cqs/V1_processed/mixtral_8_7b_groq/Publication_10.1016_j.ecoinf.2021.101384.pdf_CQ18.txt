The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the workflow is an Open Science workflow that combines vessel tracking data from satellite and AIS systems with global, high-quality, environmental, biodiversity, and fishery data. It is also mentioned that the workflow can compensate for some biases through data classification and spatio-temporal aggregation, mainly when large input datasets are used. Additionally, it is noted that all big data processing methods are approximate and can discover general and valuable knowledge if the approximation is tolerated within the application context.

The authors mention that the precision of their workflow's output depends on the completeness of the input vessel data, the update rate of the GRSF, the completeness of the OBIS data in the selected time range, and the suitability of the selected spatial resolution for the analysis. These considerations suggest that the model performance is being monitored through the evaluation of the output's precision.

Furthermore, the authors mention that their workflow can be used by other systems to extend current vessel activity classification processes through a more flexible approach that works in data-limited scenarios. This statement implies that the model's performance is being monitored through its ability to accurately classify vessel activity.

In summary, while the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context, it can be inferred that the model's performance is being monitored through the evaluation of the output's precision and the model's ability to accurately classify vessel activity.
