The provided context discusses one regularization method used in the deep learning pipeline, which is Batch Normalization. Batch Normalization is a technique introduced by Ioffe and Szegedy (2015) to accelerate deep network training by reducing internal covariate shift. It consists of a parameterized centering and reduction of pre-activations, which facilitates optimization and enables the learning rate to be raised, leading to quicker convergence. Additionally, the centering and reduction of a neuron activation is linked to the mini-batch statistics, making the neuron activation stochastic due to the stochastic mini-batch selection at each iteration. As a result, the model will not rely on a neuron activation if it has no good effect on prediction.

However, the context does not mention other regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Dropout is a technique introduced by Srivastava et al. (2014) that randomly drops out neurons during training to prevent overfitting. L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is a method that adds a penalty term to the loss function to reduce the magnitude of the weights, preventing the model from fitting the training data too closely.

In summary, the provided context discusses one regularization method, Batch Normalization, used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does not mention other regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization.
