Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that deep learning strategies, including neural networks, were used in some studies. Data augmentation is a common technique used in deep learning to increase the amount of training data and improve model performance. Some common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotation, and scaling.

Flipping is a technique where the image is flipped horizontally or vertically to create a new image. This helps the model to learn features that are invariant to direction.

Rotation involves rotating the image by a certain angle to create a new image. This helps the model to learn features that are invariant to orientation.

Scaling involves changing the size of the image to create a new image. This helps the model to learn features that are invariant to scale.

These techniques are commonly used in computer vision tasks such as image classification and object detection. However, without specific information from the context, it is not possible to confirm if these techniques were used in the studies mentioned.
