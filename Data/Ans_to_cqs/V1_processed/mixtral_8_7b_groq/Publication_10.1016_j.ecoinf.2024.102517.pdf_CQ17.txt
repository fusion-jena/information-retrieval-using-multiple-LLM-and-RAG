Based on the provided context, the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline are not mentioned. The text discusses the framework of a deep feature loss-based bird sound noise reduction network, which includes details about the layers, normalization, and non-linear operations, as well as the loss function and experimental settings. However, it does not explicitly mention the use of dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, without additional information, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to this query.
