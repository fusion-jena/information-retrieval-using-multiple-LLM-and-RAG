The provided context does not offer specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of "diverse datasets" and "remote sensing" in the context of ecological research and species distribution modeling (SDMs).

In general, deep learning approaches can utilize various data collection methods, depending on the specific application. For instance, in the context of SDMs, data collection methods may include surveys, sensors, and public datasets, as well as remote sensing techniques such as satellite imagery or aerial photography. These methods can help in gathering information about species presence, absence, or abundance, which can then be used to train deep learning models for predictive purposes.

In the context of the paper "Bias in presence-only niche models related to sampling effort and species niches: lessons for background point selection" by Botella et al. (2020), the authors discuss the importance of addressing issues such as sampling bias in the context of presence-only datasets. This suggests that the data collection method in this case involves some form of sampling, where the presence or absence of a species is recorded at specific locations.

Furthermore, the paper "Overview of Geolifeclef 2023: Species Composition Prediction with High Spatial Resolution at Continental Scale Using Remote Sensing" by Botella et al. (2023) highlights the use of remote sensing for species composition prediction at a continental scale. This suggests that satellite imagery or aerial photography may be used as a data collection method in this case.

In summary, while the provided context does not offer specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it does suggest that various data collection methods, including surveys, sensors, public datasets, and remote sensing techniques, may be used depending on the specific application. Additionally, it highlights the importance of addressing issues such as sampling bias in the context of presence-only datasets.
