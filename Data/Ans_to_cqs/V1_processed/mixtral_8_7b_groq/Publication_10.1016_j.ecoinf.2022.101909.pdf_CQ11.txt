The provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of transfer learning and fine-tuning techniques with the ResNet50 deep learning model, pre-trained on ImageNet data, for bioacoustic tasks. However, it does not mention where the data used in this pipeline is stored or hosted. Therefore, I cannot provide the data repository link based on the given context.
