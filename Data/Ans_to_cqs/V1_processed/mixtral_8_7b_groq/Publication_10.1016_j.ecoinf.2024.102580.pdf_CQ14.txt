Based on the provided context, the specific method used to optimize the hyperparameters of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated. However, it is mentioned that the model underwent 300 training cycles with a batch size of two, and the learning rate for the model backbone was set to 10. The transformer's learning rate was also set to 10. These values were presumably determined through some form of hyperparameter optimization, but the method is not specified.

Hyperparameter optimization is a crucial step in training deep learning models, as it can significantly impact the model's performance. Common methods for hyperparameter optimization include grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization. Grid search involves systematically trying out different combinations of hyperparameters within a predefined range, while random search involves randomly selecting hyperparameters within a defined range. Bayesian optimization, on the other hand, uses a probabilistic approach to select the most promising hyperparameters to try next.

Without further information, it is not possible to determine which method was used to optimize the hyperparameters of the model in question. However, it is clear that some form of hyperparameter optimization was carried out, as the learning rate and batch size were not chosen arbitrarily.
