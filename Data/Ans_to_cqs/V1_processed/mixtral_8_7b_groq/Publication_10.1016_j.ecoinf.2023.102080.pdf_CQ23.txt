Based on the provided context, there is no mention of a deep learning model being used in the study. The models mentioned are GLM (Generalized Linear Model), GAM (Generalized Additive Model), and RF (Random Forest), which are not considered deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot provide information on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model in this particular study. However, measures to ensure the generalizability of models typically include using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, and stratified splitting.
