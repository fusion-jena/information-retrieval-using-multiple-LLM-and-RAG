The provided context discusses a specific application of transfer learning (TL) for GDP prediction using CO2 emission data, and the development of Intuitionistic Fuzzy Transfer Learning (IFTL) to address the limitations of conventional TL methods. While the text does not explicitly mention preprocessing steps for deep learning models, it does touch upon some related concepts.

When discussing the vulnerabilities of TL, the text mentions the issue of data distribution differences between the source and target domains. To tackle this problem, IFTL was developed to consider the hesitancy in decision-making, which helps restrict overconfidence during TL. This concept can be linked to the preprocessing step of normalization or scaling, as these techniques can help reduce the impact of data distribution differences.

In the context of the GDP prediction problem, the authors mention the scarcity of data for certain countries. To overcome this limitation, they propose using transfer learning, which relies on previously learned information from related tasks. This process can be seen as a form of data augmentation, a preprocessing technique used to increase the amount of training data.

Lastly, the text briefly discusses the limitation of IFTL, which adds additional computation to calculate membership, non-membership, hesitancy margin, and distance metric for refining the output labels predicted by other ML approaches. This can be related to the preprocessing step of data cleaning, as IFTL aims to refine and improve the quality of the output labels.

In summary, although the provided context does not explicitly list the preprocessing steps for deep learning models, it does touch upon related concepts such as data normalization, data augmentation, and data cleaning.
