The strategy to monitor model performance during training involves several key components. First, the learning rate varies throughout the training process. Initially, a rate of 0.05 is used, followed by a rate of 0.0001 for the majority of the training. This approach allows for efficient learning while maintaining precision as training progresses.

Second, the training data is divided into three sets: 70% for the training set, 10% for the validation set, and 20% for the test set. This division strategy, based on chronological order, helps prevent data snooping bias and enhances the model's generalizability by ensuring that the validation and test sets contain different data from the training set.

Third, an early stopping strategy is employed during training. This strategy allows the training process to converge before the last epoch, preventing overfitting issues.

Lastly, the training phase accommodates multivariate input and univariate output by setting the input and output dimensions of the encoder and decoder to the number of variables in the dataset. The model dimensionality is set to 128, and it integrates 8 attention heads to enhance its ability to process parallel information flows. A dropout mechanism is also used to reduce the risk of overfitting.

In terms of performance metrics, while not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, it can be inferred that the model's forecasting performance is being monitored using appropriate metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), or others, as is common in predictive modeling tasks. However, the specific metrics used are not detailed in the context provided.
