Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training for the bird species detection task. However, it is mentioned that the mAP (mean Average Precision) scores were reported during each training epoch, which is a metric used to evaluate the performance of object detection models.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the postprocessing steps might include:

1. Metrics calculation: After the model training, the performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as mAP, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics help to understand the model's ability to detect and recognize bird species accurately.

However, there is no mention of other postprocessing steps such as generating saliency maps or confusion matrix. Saliency maps are visualizations that highlight the important regions in the input image that the model is focusing on for making predictions. A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification model by comparing the predicted labels with the actual labels.

In summary, based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training might include metrics calculation, but there is no explicit information about other steps such as generating saliency maps or confusion matrix.
