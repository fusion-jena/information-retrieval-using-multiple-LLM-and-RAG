Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as using a random seed value. The context focuses on the description of CASE, a system for monitoring H. halys individuals, and its integration with satellite images and other data sources.

However, it is important to note that randomness can be an essential factor in deep learning, especially during processes like initialization of weights, dropout, data shuffling, and model selection. Handling randomness properly can help improve model performance, prevent overfitting, and ensure reproducibility.

Here are some common strategies to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines:

1. **Fixed random seed:** To ensure reproducibility in deep learning models, you can set a fixed random seed value. This ensures that the random number generator used in the model produces the same sequence of random numbers in every run, making the training process and the final model deterministic.

2. **Weight initialization:** Deep learning models often initialize weights randomly, and different initialization methods can affect the convergence and final performance of the model. Common initialization strategies include Xavier initialization, He initialization, and orthogonal initialization.

3. **Dropout:** Regularization techniques like dropout randomly set a fraction of input units to zero during training, which helps prevent overfitting and improves generalization.

4. **Data shuffling:** Shuffling the training dataset before each epoch can ensure that the model receives the data in a different order during each training iteration, reducing the chance of overfitting to a specific order of the data.

5. **Model selection and hyperparameter tuning:** When selecting the best model or tuning hyperparameters, it is crucial to use techniques like cross-validation and to average the results from multiple runs to minimize the impact of randomness on the final choice.

Since the provided context does not discuss the deep learning pipeline in CASE, it is unclear if these strategies are employed. However, these are common practices in deep learning projects to handle randomness.
