I regret to inform you that I cannot provide the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline as it is not mentioned in the given pieces of context. The context includes references to several studies related to agroforestry and grassland biomass, as well as some information about the World Agroforestry Centre databases. However, there is no information about any deep learning pipeline or its code repository. Therefore, I would recommend looking for the information in the relevant study or contacting the authors for further details.
