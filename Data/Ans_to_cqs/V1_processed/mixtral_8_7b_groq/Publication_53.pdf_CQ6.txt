The preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, as described in the provided context, include data augmentation, image resizing, and normalization. Data augmentation is used to increase the amount of training data, reduce overfitting, and improve the model's ability to generalize. It involves applying random transformations to the images, such as vertical flipping, limiting overexposure, and disabling zooming. Image resizing is also applied to ensure that all images have the same dimensions and can be fed into the model. Normalization is used to scale the pixel values of the images to a smaller range, typically between 0 and 1, which can help the model converge faster and improve its accuracy. No specific mention of cleaning the data is made in the provided context, but it is assumed that the data was cleaned and preprocessed before being used to train the model.
