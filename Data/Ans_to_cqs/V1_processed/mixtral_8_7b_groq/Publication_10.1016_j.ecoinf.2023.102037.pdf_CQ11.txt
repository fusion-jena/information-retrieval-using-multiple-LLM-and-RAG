Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context includes details about various deep learning models and methods used for pest detection and classification in agriculture, such as YOLOv3, CSPNet, and a multi-stage deep learning method. It also mentions different datasets used for training and testing these models, such as the "Pest24" dataset. However, there is no information about where the data or code for these pipelines might be publicly available for access. Therefore, I am unable to provide a specific link to a data repository for the deep learning pipeline.
