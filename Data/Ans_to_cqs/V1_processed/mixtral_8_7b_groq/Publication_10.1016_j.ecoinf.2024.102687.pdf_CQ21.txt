Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps applied after the model training. However, it does mention that the training dataset serves as a basis to build episodic tasks useful for fine-tuning a meta-learning algorithm without human supervision. This suggests that some form of evaluation or validation would be performed after each episode or iteration of fine-tuning.

In the context of machine learning, common postprocessing steps after model training include:

1. **Evaluation Metrics Calculation:** This involves calculating various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc., to assess the performance of the model. These metrics can provide insights into how well the model is classifying the different tropical bird species.

2. **Confusion Matrix:** A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model. It can be used to calculate the aforementioned evaluation metrics. It shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, which can help identify any classes that the model is having trouble distinguishing.

3. **Saliency Maps:** Saliency maps are a way to visualize the parts of the input that the model is paying the most attention to when making its predictions. They can be useful for understanding how the model is making its decisions and can help identify any features that the model is over or underemphasizing.

4. **Fine-tuning of the Pretrained CNN Backbone:** The context mentions that fine-tuning of the pretrained CNN backbone was performed. This could be considered a postprocessing step as it occurs after the initial training of the model. Fine-tuning involves adjusting the parameters of a pretrained model to better adapt it to a new task.

Given the nature of the project, which involves fine-tuning a meta-learning algorithm for ecoacoustic studies, it's likely that the postprocessing steps would include some form of evaluation metrics calculation and possibly the creation of confusion matrices to assess the performance of the model. However, the context does not provide enough information to definitively say what the postprocessing steps are.
