The context does not explicitly mention the specific method used to optimize the model's hyperparameters. However, it does mention that a validation set is used during training to fine-tune hyperparameters and assess the model's performance on unseen data. This suggests that some form of hyperparameter optimization is being employed.

Common methods for hyperparameter optimization include grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization. Grid search involves systematically testing all possible combinations of hyperparameters within a predefined range. Random search, on the other hand, involves randomly selecting hyperparameters within a specified range, which can be more efficient than grid search. Bayesian optimization uses a probabilistic model to make informed decisions about which hyperparameters to try next, based on previous evaluations.

Without more specific information from the context, it is difficult to determine which of these methods (or potentially another method) is being used to optimize the model's hyperparameters. Nonetheless, the use of a validation set indicates that some effort is being made to find the best set of hyperparameters for the model.
