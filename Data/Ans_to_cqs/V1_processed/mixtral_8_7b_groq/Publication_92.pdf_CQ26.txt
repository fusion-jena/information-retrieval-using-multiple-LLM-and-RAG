The provided context discusses the data preprocessing methods used for coral reef fish detection and recognition in underwater videos, but it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.

However, it does mention that the training database was created by cropping frames from videos and labeling them with the help of biology experts from the MARBEC laboratory. They kept only the species with more than 450 thumbnails and widened the database by applying rotations and symmetries to capture all possible positions of the fishes. Additionally, they added a class for the background, which is constituted with random thumbnails of the background and specific background thumbnails taken around the fish thumbnails. This approach of adding a background class and augmenting the data by rotations and symmetries can be seen as a way to increase the diversity of the data and avoid bias towards certain species or backgrounds.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention the techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, it does describe methods to increase data diversity and avoid bias by keeping a minimum number of samples per species, adding a background class, and augmenting the data through rotations and symmetries.
