Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the use of a deep learning model. However, I can still address the query regarding the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model, as some of the techniques mentioned could be applicable to deep learning as well.

Firstly, the dataset used for training the model seems to be diverse, as it covers the Muntjac range across Great Britain and Ireland Isles. This geographical spread of data can help the model to learn a wider variety of patterns and features, which in turn can improve its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

Secondly, the evaluation of the model was carried out using two different test datasets: a 25% random test set and a test set consisting only of Irish records. This approach allows for a better understanding of the model's performance across different subsets of the data, which can help to identify any potential issues related to overfitting or bias towards specific regions.

However, the context does not explicitly mention techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting. Cross-validation is a powerful technique for improving model generalizability by dividing the dataset into multiple folds, training the model on different subsets, and averaging the performance metrics. Stratified splitting, on the other hand, ensures that the distribution of classes remains similar in both training and testing sets, which can be crucial for maintaining the model's performance when dealing with imbalanced datasets.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not explicitly state the use of cross-validation or stratified splitting, the model evaluation process involving two different test datasets can still contribute to the generalizability of the model. Nonetheless, incorporating cross-validation and stratified splitting techniques would further strengthen the model's ability to generalize and provide more robust performance estimates.
