Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context focuses on discussing the results of machine learning models applied to predict certain parameters in water quality, such as pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and others. It provides a list of parameters, their units, and abbreviations, but it does not mention any details about the hardware resources used for training the models. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query without additional information.
