Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about post-processing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrix calculation. However, it does mention that the classification performance of models is evaluated using test set accuracy.

In the context, three different models (RF, SVM, MLP) are evaluated for features F4, F5, F6, F7, F4⊕F5⊕F6, F4⊕F5⊕F6⊕F7, and Fdh. The accuracy of these models on the test set is provided in Table 7. This implies that the metrics calculation involved after model training includes test set accuracy.

However, there is no information about other post-processing techniques such as saliency map generation or confusion matrix calculation. Saliency maps are often used to visualize the importance of input features in the prediction made by a model. A confusion matrix, on the other hand, is used to evaluate the performance of a classification model by comparing its predicted labels to the actual labels.

In the proposed models section, the network architecture is described, but there is no mention of any post-processing steps. The network consists of four convolution kernel pooling layers, followed by a fully connected layer with a dropout layer to reduce network parameters. A Dense_1 layer is added after flattening to reduce the dimension of the deep features.

In summary, based on the provided context, the post-processing steps involved after model training include metrics calculation in the form of test set accuracy. However, there is no explicit information about other post-processing techniques such as saliency map generation or confusion matrix calculation.
