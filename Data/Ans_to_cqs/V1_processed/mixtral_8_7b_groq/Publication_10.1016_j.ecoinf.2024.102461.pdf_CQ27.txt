Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, we can infer that the model was likely serialized and then integrated into a geographic information system (GIS) software, such as QGIS, for visualization and further analysis.

The context discusses the use of remote sensing data, specifically Landsat 8 imagery and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images, for creating fire risk maps in fire-sensitive forest ecosystems. It also mentions the application of various modeling techniques, including deep learning. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that a deep learning model was trained using the remote sensing data and other relevant parameters.

Once the model was trained, it would need to be deployed for practical use. Model serialization is a common practice for deploying deep learning models. This process involves saving the model architecture, weights, and other relevant information into a file, which can then be loaded and used for making predictions on new data.

After serialization, the deep learning model would need to be integrated into a GIS software for visualization and further analysis. QGIS is mentioned in the context, and it is a popular open-source GIS software that supports the integration of machine learning models. By incorporating the deep learning model into QGIS, users can apply the model to the remote sensing data to generate fire risk maps and visualize the results.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit information on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, we can infer that the model was likely serialized and then integrated into a GIS software, such as QGIS, for visualization and further analysis.
