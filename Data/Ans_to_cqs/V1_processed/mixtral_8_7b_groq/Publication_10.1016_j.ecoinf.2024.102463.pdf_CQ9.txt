The provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The study, "A neural network encoder-decoder for time series prediction: Application on 137Cs particulate concentrations in nuclearized rivers," was published in the Ecological Informatics journal and investigates the use of a deep learning tool for reconstructing caesium-137 chronics particulate concentration in rivers.

The study mentions the use of an encoder-decoder neural network, Hierarchical Attention-Based Recurrent Highway Networks (HRHN), and provides details about the CNN window size, number of filters, hidden layers, and dimension of the hidden state. However, it does not specify the data repository where the pipeline's data is available.

To find the data repository, one could look at the references or additional materials provided in the study or contact the authors directly. The authors, Kathleen Pel´e, Val´erie Nicoulaud-Gouin, and Hugo Lepage, are affiliated with the Institut de Radioprotection et de Sûret´e Nucl´eaire (IRSN) in France.

In summary, the provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. To find this information, one could look at the study's references or additional materials or contact the authors directly.
