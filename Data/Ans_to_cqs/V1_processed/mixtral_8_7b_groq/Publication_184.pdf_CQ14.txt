Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. The text does not mention any specific techniques such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization.

However, we can infer some information about the selection of hyperparameters. The learning rate was set to 0.001, the batch size was 16, and the number of subdivisions was 64. These values were likely chosen based on previous experience or recommendations from the literature. The number of iterations was set to 4000, and the number of epochs was set to 200. These values were probably determined through experimentation, as the text mentions that the model's performance improved up to a certain point and then started to degrade, indicating that there was a risk of overfitting.

Furthermore, the text mentions that the model was trained using data augmentation, which involves creating new training examples by applying various transformations to the existing data. This technique can help reduce overfitting and improve the model's generalization performance.

In summary, while the text does not provide explicit information about the optimization of hyperparameters, we can infer that some experimentation and selection based on previous experience or recommendations were involved. Additionally, data augmentation was used to improve the model's performance.
