While the provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does offer some insights into the general workings of XGBoost and deep learning models that can be used to infer relevant information.

Deep learning models, often referred to as "black boxes," have complex structures that can make them challenging to interpret. This complexity also implies that they may incorporate various sources of randomness. One possible strategy to manage this randomness is through the use of a fixed random seed value. This practice ensures consistent results when running the same model multiple times, as it controls the randomness in processes like weight initialization and data shuffling. However, the context does not explicitly confirm if this method is used in deep learning pipelines.

On the other hand, XGBoost, known for its interpretability, does not seem to rely heavily on managing randomness in the same way as deep learning models. Its decision-making process is more transparent, with features like importance scores and decision rules. The context highlights that XGBoost performs well even with limited data, while deep learning models typically require substantial datasets to achieve optimal results. This difference suggests that deep learning models might need more sophisticated strategies to handle randomness due to their complexity and data requirements.

In summary, although the provided context does not explicitly answer the query, it can be inferred that a common strategy for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines is the use of a fixed random seed value. However, this is not explicitly stated, and further research would be needed to confirm this practice.
