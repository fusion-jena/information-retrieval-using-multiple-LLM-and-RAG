The provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text focuses on the ecological source areas (ESAs) and ecological corridors (ECs) within the Wei River Basin (WRB) in China, and the optimization of these areas using the Genetic Algorithm (GA). The GA was used to identify optimal ESAs, and the performance of the algorithm was affected by the size of the initial population (Pop). However, there is no mention of the code repository or the deep learning pipeline used in this study. Therefore, I am unable to provide the location of the code repository.
