The provided context does not give information on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text focuses on the analysis of the network's Average Shortest Path Length (ASPL) for different Land Use Types (LUTs), and it does not mention any methods used for hyperparameter optimization such as grid search, random search, or others. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
