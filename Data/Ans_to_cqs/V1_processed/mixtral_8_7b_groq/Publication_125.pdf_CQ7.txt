The dataset used for training the deep learning model is split into three parts: training set, validation set, and testing set. The training set consists of 22,666 images, which are used to train the model. The validation set, containing 7554 images, is used to validate the trained model. Lastly, the testing set, also with 7554 images, is used to assess the model's performance.

This dataset is derived from satellite images, where a semantic segmentation is conducted using previous works to extract four classes: urban, bare soil, vegetation, and road. Each image containing a given class is then divided into non-overlapping blocks of 256 Ã— 256 pixels and saved into folders, each with the name of the corresponding class.

The deep learning model used in this study is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and the training process involves two scenarios. In the first scenario, the CNN model is trained and tested using unencrypted data. This resulted in 96.91% and 96.84% accuracy for training and validation, respectively, on the training dataset, and 93.84% accuracy for the testing dataset. In the second scenario, the CNN model is trained and tested over encrypted data, achieving 94.04% and 94.30% accuracy for training and validation, respectively, and 90.92% accuracy for the testing dataset.

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the data is split into three sets for the purpose of training, validating, and testing the model. This common practice in machine learning helps to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data and prevents overfitting.
