Based on the provided context, the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly stated. However, it is mentioned that "simple crop and resize data augmentation is used with the default settings of Caffe" (Caffe being the deep learning framework used in the study).

In the context of Caffe, "simple crop and resize" typically refers to randomly cropping an image to a certain size (in this case, 224 Ã— 224 pixels) and then resizing it back to its original size. During the testing phase, the image is typically cropped at the center. This technique is a form of translational data augmentation, which helps the model learn translation-invariant features.

Other common data augmentation techniques such as rotation, scaling, and flipping are not explicitly mentioned in the context. However, these techniques are generally used in deep learning pipelines to increase the diversity of the training data and improve the model's ability to generalize. It is possible that these techniques were also used in this study, but the context does not provide enough information to confirm this.

In summary, while the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly stated in the provided context, it is mentioned that "simple crop and resize" data augmentation is used with Caffe. Other common techniques such as rotation, scaling, and flipping might have been used as well, but this cannot be confirmed based on the provided context.
