The deep learning pipeline in the context provided primarily uses satellite and aerial RGB images as raw data for training the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. The images are sourced from two databases: Google, Maxar, and the NWPU-RESISC45 dataset. 

In the database construction phase, five training datasets are built with examples of images that have different levels of tree cover, continuous and discrete approximations, and inclusion of the auxiliary class “Non-Forest” (Section 2.2 and Supplementary Material, Archive S2). This suggests that the data collection involves acquiring images with varying tree cover densities and non-forest areas.

The specific source of the images is not explicitly mentioned, but it can be inferred that they are from satellites or aircrafts given the high resolution and the involvement of Google and Maxar, companies that provide such imagery. 

Additionally, the study uses metadata from FAO’s GDA photointerpreted very high resolution plots and training dataset of a continuous larger sample CNN-based model (Archive S1 and S2). These metadata likely provide coordinates, region, aridity level, class (Forest/Non-forest), and tree cover information, which are used in conjunction with the images for training the CNN models.

However, the context does not provide information on whether surveys or other data collection methods were used, or if public datasets were utilized. Therefore, it can be said that satellite and aerial imagery are the primary sources of raw data, but specific details on other data collection methods or public datasets are not available in the provided context.
