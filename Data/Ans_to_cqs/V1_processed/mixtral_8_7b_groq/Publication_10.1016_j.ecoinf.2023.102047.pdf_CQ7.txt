The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training typically include creating separate sets for training, validation, and testing. This split is crucial to assess the model's performance, generalization, and overfitting.

1. Training set: This is the portion of data used to train the model. The model learns patterns from this data and adjusts its parameters accordingly. In the context provided, the .xml files are converted to .txt files, which store the bounding-box coordinates of objects. These .txt files, along with images, serve as input for model training. Data augmentation techniques, such as random cropping, flipping, rotation, and adjusting brightness, are applied to increase the size and variability of the training set.

2. Validation set: This set is used to validate the model during the training phase. It helps to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. The validation set is independent of the training set, and the model's performance on this set provides an unbiased evaluation of the model's generalization capability. However, the context provided does not explicitly mention the use of a validation set in the training process.

3. Testing set: After training and validating the model, the testing set is used to provide an unbiased evaluation of the model's performance on unseen data. This set should also be independent of the training and validation sets. The testing phase assesses the model's ability to make accurate predictions on new data.

In summary, the criteria for splitting data in deep learning model training generally involve creating separate sets for training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. The context provided focuses on data preprocessing, model architecture, and data augmentation but does not explicitly mention the use of a validation or testing set.
