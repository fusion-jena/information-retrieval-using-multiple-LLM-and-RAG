The provided texts discuss various techniques used in the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, including addressing data bias. However, not all of the texts focus on this specific topic.

One technique to address data bias is stratified splitting. This method involves dividing the data into subgroups that are representative of the entire dataset. For instance, in a study of animal populations, the data might be divided into subgroups based on species or habitat. This ensures that each subgroup is proportionally represented in the training, validation, and test sets.

Another technique is oversampling, which involves increasing the number of instances in a particular class to balance the dataset. This can be useful when dealing with a class-imbalanced dataset, where one class has significantly more instances than another. However, oversampling can lead to overfitting, where the model becomes too specialized to the training data and performs poorly on new data.

Undersampling is another technique that can be used to address class imbalance. This method involves reducing the number of instances in the majority class to balance the dataset. However, this technique can lead to loss of valuable information.

Diverse data collection is a technique that can be used during the data collection phase to ensure that the dataset is representative of the population. This involves collecting data from a variety of sources and ensuring that the data is diverse in terms of factors such as location, time, and demographics.

The paper by Kavzoglu (2009) discusses increasing the accuracy of neural network classification using refined training data. While not explicitly addressing data bias, this technique can be useful in addressing class imbalance by ensuring that the training data is of high quality and representative of the population.

The paper by Kellenberger et al. (2020) discusses AIDE, a tool for accelerating image-based ecological surveys with interactive machine learning. While not explicitly addressing data bias, this tool can be useful in collecting diverse data by allowing researchers to interactively label and classify images.

In summary, techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. These techniques can help ensure that the dataset is representative of the population and improve the performance of the model.
