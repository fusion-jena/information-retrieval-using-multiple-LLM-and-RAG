Based on the provided context, the specific data augmentation techniques used in the STARdbi pipeline's deep learning component are not mentioned. The pipeline includes sampling flying insects with sticky traps, scanning the traps, uploading the scanned images and metadata to the STARdbi database, and automatically detecting insects in the images. The detection process involves training and storing models using the site's interface and computational resources. However, the context does not provide information on data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, we cannot provide an accurate answer to this query without additional information.
