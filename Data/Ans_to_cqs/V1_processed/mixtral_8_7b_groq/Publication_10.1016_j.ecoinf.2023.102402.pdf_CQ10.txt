I am unable to provide the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline as there is no information about it in the provided context. The articles and abstracts given focus on topics such as conservation biology, ecological corridors, GIS analysis, marine citizen science, risk maps, seahorses, species distribution models, and wildlife management. However, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or any code repository link. I can only provide information that is present in the given context.
