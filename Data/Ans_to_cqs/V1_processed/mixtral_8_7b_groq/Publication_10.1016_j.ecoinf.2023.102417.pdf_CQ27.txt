Based on the provided context, the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model would include several steps:

Firstly, once the deep learning model has been trained on a dataset that resembles the data it will be applied to later, the model needs to be serialized. Model serialization is the process of saving the model's architecture, weights, and biases to a file, so that it can be loaded and used later without having to retrain the model. This file can then be deployed to a variety of platforms.

Secondly, the platform on which the model will be deployed needs to be selected. This decision will depend on a number of factors, including the resources available, the required latency, and the desired scalability. For example, if the model is to be deployed in a resource-constrained environment, such as a mobile device, then a lightweight platform may be required. On the other hand, if the model is to be deployed in a data center, then a more powerful platform may be appropriate.

Thirdly, once the platform has been selected, the serialized model needs to be loaded onto the platform. This process will depend on the specific platform being used, but it typically involves writing code to load the serialized model and make it available for use.

Fourthly, when deploying the model, it is important to consider the transferability of the model. If the training and model application are based on datasets taken with different devices, then additional considerations are needed. For example, if the training data and the test data are recorded with different types of cameras, different illumination conditions, and/or different acquisition geometries, then the model may perform poorly. To address this issue, techniques such as data augmentation, transfer learning, and domain adaptation can be used.

Finally, when deploying the model, it is important to consider how the model will be integrated into the overall system. This may involve writing code to preprocess the input data, postprocess the output data, and handle any errors or exceptions that may occur.

In summary, the process of deploying a trained deep learning model involves serializing the model, selecting a platform, loading the model onto the platform, considering the transferability of the model, and integrating the model into the overall system.
