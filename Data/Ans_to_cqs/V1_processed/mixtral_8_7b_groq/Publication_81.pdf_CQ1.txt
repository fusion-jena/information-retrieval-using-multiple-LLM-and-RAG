The provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the study uses DNA barcode sequences to classify fish from different families. DNA barcoding is a method of species identification that uses a short DNA sequence from a standardized region of the genome, which can be obtained through DNA sequencing. The specific methods used to obtain these DNA barcode sequences are not mentioned in the context. Therefore, we cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
