The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in the given context are the F1 score and the Jaccard index.

The F1 score is a measure of the accuracy of a binary classification model. It is calculated as the harmonic mean of precision and recall, where precision is the number of true positive predictions divided by the total number of positive predictions, and recall is the number of true positive predictions divided by the total number of actual positives. The F1 score ranges from 0 to 1, with a score of 1 indicating perfect precision and recall.

The Jaccard index, also known as the Jaccard similarity coefficient, is a measure of the similarity between two sets. It is calculated as the size of the intersection of the two sets divided by the size of the union of the two sets. In the context of image segmentation, the Jaccard index is used to measure the similarity between the predicted segmentation mask and the ground truth mask. It ranges from 0 to 1, with a score of 1 indicating perfect overlap between the predicted and ground truth masks.

In the study mentioned in the context, the deep learning model achieved an F1 score of 0.9034 and a Jaccard index of 0.8287 on the test set. These metrics indicate that the model is performing well in classifying and segmenting the target vegetation species, Hedychium Coronarium.
