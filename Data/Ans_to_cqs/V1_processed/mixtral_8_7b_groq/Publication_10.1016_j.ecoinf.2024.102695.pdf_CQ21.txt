After the model training process, there are several postprocessing steps involved, although the provided context does not explicitly mention saliency maps. The following steps can be identified from the context:

1. Metrics calculation: The performance of the model is evaluated using various metrics. For instance, in the case of DO (dissolved oxygen) prediction in the Shandong peninsula, the effectiveness of the model is determined by evaluating the model forecasting performance metrics as described in Section 4.1. However, the context does not provide specific details about the calculated metrics.

2. Confusion matrix (implicit): Although the context does not explicitly mention a confusion matrix, it does mention the division of the dataset into training, validation, and test sets, which is used to prevent data snooping bias and enhance the generalizability of the model. This allocation strategy allows for the calculation of a confusion matrix (or similar error matrix) for the classification tasks, had there been any.

3. Early stopping: To prevent overfitting, the training process employs an early stopping strategy, which causes the training to converge before the last epoch. This strategy helps in finding a balance between the model's performance on the training data and its ability to generalize to unseen data.

4. Model architecture details: The context provides information about the model architecture, such as the number of encoder and decoder layers, the input and output dimensions, the model dimensionality, and the attention heads. This information is useful for understanding the model's complexity and its ability to process information.

5. Hardware and software specifications: The context also includes details about the hardware and software used for running the tests, such as the operating system, GPU, and Python version. This information can be helpful for reproducibility and comparison purposes.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention saliency maps, it does discuss metrics calculation, confusion matrix (implicitly), early stopping, model architecture details, and hardware and software specifications as postprocessing steps after model training.
