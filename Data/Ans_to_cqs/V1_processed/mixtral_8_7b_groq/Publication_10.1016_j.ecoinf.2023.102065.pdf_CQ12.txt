The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the context provided, which mentions the use of ResNet architectures and MobileNetv2, both of which are variants of CNNs. The authors use these CNN models for bird species classification, and they conclude that MobileNetv2 could be useful for applications requiring smaller CNN architectures. Furthermore, the pre-training of their CNN classification models is also performed using recordings of bird vocalizations, which are processed using spectrogram parameters to improve the accuracy of bioacoustic classification using CNNs. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model used in this pipeline is a CNN.
