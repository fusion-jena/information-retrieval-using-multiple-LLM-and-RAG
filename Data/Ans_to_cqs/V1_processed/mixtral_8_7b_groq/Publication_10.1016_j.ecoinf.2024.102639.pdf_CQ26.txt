The provided context discusses the methodology used for analyzing spatial working memory in T-maze experiments, which includes data preprocessing and training of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. However, it does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline.

That being said, some of the techniques mentioned in the context could be used to address data bias in a broader sense. For instance, the authors mention the use of cross-validation and grid search for hyperparameter tuning, which can help ensure that the model is not biased towards a particular subset of the data. Additionally, the selection of the distance metric (Euclidean) was based on the data's characteristics, which could be seen as a form of data-driven bias correction.

In terms of data preprocessing techniques specifically used to address data bias, the context does not provide enough information. However, some common techniques used in deep learning pipelines include:

1. Stratified splitting: This involves dividing the data into subsets (e.g., training, validation, and testing) while preserving the distribution of important variables. This can help ensure that each subset of the data is representative of the overall population.
2. Oversampling: This involves increasing the number of instances of a particular class in the data to balance out the class distribution. This can help prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.
3. Undersampling: This involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class in the data to balance out the class distribution. This can help prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.
4. Diverse data collection: This involves collecting data from a variety of sources and ensuring that the data is representative of the overall population. This can help prevent the model from being biased towards a particular subset of the data.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, some of the techniques mentioned (e.g., cross-validation, grid search, and data-driven distance metric selection) could be seen as forms of bias correction. Additionally, common techniques used in deep learning pipelines to address data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.
