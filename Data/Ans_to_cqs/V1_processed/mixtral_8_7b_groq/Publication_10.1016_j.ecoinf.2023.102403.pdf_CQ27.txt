I don't have enough information to directly answer the query about deploying a trained deep learning model. However, I can describe the data processing steps mentioned in the context that could be relevant to building and preparing data for a machine learning model.

Zhang & Grassle (2002) presented the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS), a data source mentioned in the context. Zizka et al. (2020) discussed cleaning biodiversity data from GBIF and OBIF, focusing on removing duplicates, resolving taxonomic inconsistencies, and filtering data based on native ranges.

The data processing pipeline can be summarized as follows:

1. **Data Collection**: The authors collected 71,670,596 records from GBIF and OBIS.

2. **Data Curation**: After the initial data collection, the authors performed data curation, reducing the dataset to 5,380,439 records. While the specific curation steps are not detailed, Zizka et al. (2020) provided a paper on cleaning GBIF data, which could include steps like handling duplicates, resolving taxonomic issues, and removing records with missing or invalid information.

3. **Taxonomic Filtering**: The dataset was further reduced to 5,007,322 records after taxonomic filtering. This step might involve filtering based on specific taxonomic groups or higher-level classifications, depending on the study's focus.

4. **Deletion of Data Outside Native Range**: The final dataset contained 820,004 records after removing data outside the native range. This step is crucial for building machine learning models focused on specific geographical areas or species distributions.

While these steps are essential for preparing data for machine learning models, the provided context does not contain information on model serialization, platform selection, or deploying a deep learning model.
