Based on the provided context, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident in the description of the sampling actions' impact on the classification accuracy, where it mentions the VGG19 model, which is more similar to the traditional CNN model. Additionally, the CNN model is further built using the Keras library in TensorFlow, as stated in the data processing steps. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model utilized in this study is a CNN.
