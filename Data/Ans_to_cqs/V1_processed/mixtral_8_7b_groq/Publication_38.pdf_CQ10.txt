Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text describes the performance and architecture of the CNNFAST network, as well as its comparison to other methods in ecological monitoring applications. However, it does not mention where the code for this pipeline can be found. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to the code repository.
