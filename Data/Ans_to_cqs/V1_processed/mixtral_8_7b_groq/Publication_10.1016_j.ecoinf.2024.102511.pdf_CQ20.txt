The specific hardware resources used for training deep learning models are not explicitly mentioned in the provided sources. However, it is generally common practice to use Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) for training deep learning models due to their ability to perform parallel processing, which is particularly useful for the matrix and vector operations that are prevalent in deep learning algorithms.

Some sources do mention the use of computational resources for bioacoustic analysis. For example, Stowell (2022) discusses the use of computational bioacoustics with deep learning, but does not specify the hardware used. The United States National Marine Fisheries Service (2016) mentions the use of "high-performance computing resources" for a comprehensive assessment of marine mammal, marine turtle, and seabird abundance and spatial distribution. However, the specific type of hardware is not mentioned.

In the context of marine mammal bioacoustic analysis, Li et al. (2020a) developed a model-based method for species-level classification of marine mammals using echolocation signals, but they do not specify the hardware used for training their deep learning models. Similarly, LeBien and Ioup (2018) and Yano et al. (2018) conducted species-level classification of beaked whale echolocation signals, but the hardware resources used for training their models are not mentioned.

In the context of image data augmentation for deep learning, Shorten and Khoshgoftaar (2019) mention the use of "powerful computational resources" but do not specify the type of hardware used.

Therefore, while it is likely that GPUs are used for training deep learning models in bioacoustic analysis, the specific hardware resources are not explicitly mentioned in the provided sources.
