Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, such as through methods like grid search or random search.

 However, it is mentioned that models were trained and tested by tuning the number of required epochs. This implies that some form of hyperparameter tuning was performed, as the number of epochs is a hyperparameter that determines the number of times the learning algorithm will work through the entire training dataset.

 Additionally, the results table shows the top-1, top-5, and top-20 accuracy percentages for different models and data filters. The fact that multiple models and data filters were tried suggests that some form of model selection or hyperparameter tuning was performed, although the specific method is not mentioned.

 Therefore, while the specific method of hyperparameter optimization is not mentioned in the provided context, it is clear that some form of hyperparameter tuning was performed during the training and testing of the models.
