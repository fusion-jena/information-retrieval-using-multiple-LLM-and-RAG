In the context provided, there is no explicit mention of the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline for plant identification. However, data augmentation is a common technique used in deep learning to increase the amount and variety of training data. It involves creating modified versions of the existing data, such as flipping, rotating, and scaling images.

In the context of plant identification, flipping and rotating images can help the model learn to recognize plants from different angles and orientations. Scaling images can help the model learn to recognize plants of different sizes. Other possible data augmentation techniques could include brightness and contrast adjustments, which could help the model learn to recognize plants in different lighting conditions.

In the study mentioned in the context, the authors used the PlantClef2015 dataset, which has a limited number of images compared to other major datasets for images, videos, or languages. To improve the optimization capability of their deep CNN networks, they could have applied data augmentation techniques to increase the size and variety of their training data.

In summary, while the specific data augmentation techniques used in the study are not mentioned, flipping, rotating, and scaling images are common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning. These techniques could have been applied in the study to increase the size and variety of the training data and improve the optimization capability of the deep CNN networks.
