The text provided does not specifically mention the use of deep learning in conjunction with a pipeline that involves image, audio, video, or CSV data formats. However, it does discuss the use of satellite data, particularly Landsat-8 satellite data, in a land use and land cover (LULC) classification study.

The Landsat-8 satellite data used in the study were obtained from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform in the form of spectral bands, including blue, green, red, near-infrared, and two shortwave infrared bands. Additionally, a quality assurance (QA) band was used to identify and remove clouds and shadows from the images.

While the study does not explicitly mention deep learning, it does discuss the use of machine learning (ML) algorithms, including support vector machines (SVMs), random forests (RFs), decision trees (DTs), and artificial neural networks (ANNs), for LULC classification. Among these, RFs were found to outperform the other ML classifiers in LULC and crop mapping.

Therefore, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the data format used in the ML pipeline for LULC classification is satellite imagery, specifically Landsat-8 satellite data. However, the text does not provide information on the use of deep learning in conjunction with other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV.
