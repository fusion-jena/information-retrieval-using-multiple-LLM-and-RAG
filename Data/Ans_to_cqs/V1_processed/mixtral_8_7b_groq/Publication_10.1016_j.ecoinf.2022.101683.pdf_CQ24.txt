The provided context does not directly discuss strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does discuss methods used to address sampling bias in invasive Species Distribution Models (iSDM), which can be related to the concept of randomness.

One approach to handle sampling bias is by using weighted background points. This method involves assigning weights to background points based on their proximity to presence points, which helps to account for the uneven distribution of data. Another strategy is the use of filtered records, where a pre-thinning process is applied to remove redundant records and reduce bias. Lastly, targeted background points are used, where the input extents are varied to fit the model to various spatial extents.

While these methods do not directly address randomness in the deep learning pipeline, they do highlight the importance of accounting for bias and variability in data. In deep learning, randomness can be introduced through various mechanisms such as random weight initialization, dropout, and data shuffling. To handle these sources of randomness, deep learning practitioners can employ strategies such as setting a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility, using techniques like cross-validation to average performance over multiple runs, and monitoring the model's performance across different random initializations.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does emphasize the importance of accounting for bias and variability in data. In deep learning, randomness can be introduced through various mechanisms, and practitioners can employ strategies such as setting a fixed random seed value, using cross-validation, and monitoring performance across different random initializations to handle these sources of randomness.
