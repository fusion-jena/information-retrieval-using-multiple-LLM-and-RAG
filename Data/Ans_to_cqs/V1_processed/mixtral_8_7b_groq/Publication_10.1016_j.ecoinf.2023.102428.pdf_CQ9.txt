The context provided does not give information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the research design, data processing, and model description of a study that uses a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) algorithm and Markov chain for land use and land cover (LULC) simulation. However, it does not mention where the data used in this study is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
