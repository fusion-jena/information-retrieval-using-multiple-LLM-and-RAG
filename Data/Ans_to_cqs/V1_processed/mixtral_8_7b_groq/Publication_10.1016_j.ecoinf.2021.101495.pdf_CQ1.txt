The context provided does not give specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipelines of the studies mentioned. However, it does provide some insights into the nature of the data used in the studies.

In the study by Qiao et al., deep learning methods were applied to electronic monitoring data for automated catch event detection in longline fishing. This suggests that the raw data was collected using electronic monitoring sensors or similar technology.

In the study by Rathi et al., a convolutional neural network was used for underwater fish species classification. The context mentions the use of "fishing sets," but it does not provide specific information about how these sets were collected or whether they were publicly available datasets, collected by the researchers, or obtained from other sources.

The study by Murua et al. focuses on the use of neural networks for segmentation and classification in the context of tuna fishing. The figure provided shows segmented images of tuna, suggesting that the raw data likely includes images or video of tuna. However, the context does not provide information on how these images were collected.

In summary, while the context does not provide specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data, it suggests that electronic monitoring sensors, images or video, and possibly other sources, were used in the deep learning pipelines of these studies.
