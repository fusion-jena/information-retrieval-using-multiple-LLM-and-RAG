The provided context does not contain information about strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Instead, it discusses ecological informatics, forest area, grassland area, cropland area, orchard area, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), and the Jenks natural breaks optimization method.

However, I can provide some general strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline:

1. **Fixed random seed value**: To ensure reproducibility, you can set a fixed random seed value for various random processes, such as data shuffling, weight initialization, and dropout. This will make the training process deterministic and enable you to reproduce the same results.

2. **Cross-validation**: Cross-validation is a technique used to assess the performance of a machine learning model. It involves dividing the dataset into multiple folds, training the model on different subsets, and evaluating it on the remaining portions. This can help reduce the impact of randomness and provide a more robust estimate of the model's performance.

3. **Ensemble methods**: Ensemble methods, such as bagging and boosting, can help reduce the impact of randomness by aggregating the predictions of multiple models trained on different subsets of the data. This can lead to more stable and accurate predictions.

4. **Regularization techniques**: Regularization techniques, such as L1 and L2 regularization, can help reduce overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. This can help make the model more robust to random variations in the data.

5. **Data augmentation**: Data augmentation involves creating new synthetic samples by applying random transformations to the existing data. This can help increase the size of the dataset and reduce the impact of randomness on the model's performance.

I hope this information is helpful. Let me know if you have any other questions.
