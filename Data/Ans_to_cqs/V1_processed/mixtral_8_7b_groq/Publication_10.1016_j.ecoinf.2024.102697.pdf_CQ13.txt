The text provided does not mention the use of deep learning models. Instead, it discusses the use of random forest models for machine learning. Therefore, I cannot provide information on the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model because they are not mentioned in the context.

However, for the random forest model, the primary hyperparameters used are the number of trees, leaves, and clustering methods. During model development, hyperparameter optimization was performed using Bayesian Optimization to minimize a 5 k-fold cross-validation loss. The training performance was calculated based on the inner cross-validated ensemble, while the testing performance was determined by selecting the optimal set of hyperparameters from the entire training set to predict on the holdout data. This process was repeated 15 times for each unique model to reduce potential bias and variance related to random sampling.

To summarize, the hyperparameters used in the random forest model are the number of trees, leaves, and clustering methods, and they were optimized using Bayesian Optimization during model development. However, I cannot provide information on the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model because they are not mentioned in the context.
