Based on the provided context, there is no specific deep learning model mentioned in the Wang et al. (2023) paper that they used in their pipeline for improving NDVI reconstruction and long-term vegetation cover study in the Danjiang River basin. They discussed various NDVI time-series reconstruction techniques, including the Savitzky-Golay filter, harmonic analysis of time series (HANTS), and optimal estimate of global biome-specific parameter settings for HANTS, but none of these methods explicitly involve deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or Transformers.

However, other papers in the context discuss the use of deep learning models for related tasks. For example, Li et al. (2022) fused optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images based on deep learning to reconstruct vegetation NDVI time series in cloud-prone regions. Mao et al. (2023) also used SAR-optical fusion with spatio-temporal partitioning and multiple linear regression to reconstruct cloud-contaminated NDVI images. Pipia et al. (2019) fused optical and SAR time series for LAI gap filling with multioutput Gaussian processes.

While these papers do not explicitly mention the use of CNNs, RNNs, or Transformers, it is possible that they used one of these models or a variant as part of their deep learning pipeline. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query.
