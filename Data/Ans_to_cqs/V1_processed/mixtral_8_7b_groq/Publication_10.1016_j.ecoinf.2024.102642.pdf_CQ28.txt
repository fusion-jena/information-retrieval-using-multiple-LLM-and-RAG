The provided context does not give information about which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. It is possible that the model was deployed on-premises rather than on a cloud platform. The context does mention that the Ple de Calcul et de DonnÂ´ees Marines (PCDM) provided computational resources, but it does not specify whether these were cloud-based or local. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query with certainty.
