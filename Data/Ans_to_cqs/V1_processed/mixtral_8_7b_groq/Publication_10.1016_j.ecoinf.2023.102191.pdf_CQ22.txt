Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the performance metrics used to evaluate a deep learning model. The context discusses a study about crowdsourcing biodiversity data from recreational SCUBA divers using the Dive Reporter app. The app collects metadata on location, number of dives, and number of divers, allowing for normalization based on sampling effort. The study also mentions the use of standardization by focusing on the frequency and abundance of specific taxa. However, it does not mention any deep learning models or the evaluation metrics used for such models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional information.
