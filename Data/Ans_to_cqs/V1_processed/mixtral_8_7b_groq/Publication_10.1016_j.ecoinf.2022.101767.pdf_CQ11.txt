Based on the provided context, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link where the pipeline can be accessed. The context focuses on a study that used wild bird species videos from YouTube and analyzed the species richness in those videos. The methodology for selecting the videos and the statistical analysis of the data are discussed, but there is no information about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline.
