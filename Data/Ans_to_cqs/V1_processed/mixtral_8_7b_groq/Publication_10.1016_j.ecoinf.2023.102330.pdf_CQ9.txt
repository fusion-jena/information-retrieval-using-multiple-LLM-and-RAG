Based on the provided context, there is no information given about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the methodology used for acoustic detection of a target species, specifically the Northern bobwhite, using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It explains how the data is prepared, including the use of data augmentation to estimate the probability of detection, and how the CNN is trained and used for detection.

However, the text does not mention where the data used in this study is stored or how it can be accessed. It is possible that the data is not publicly available, or that it is stored in a repository that is not listed in the provided options (Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF).

Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to the query as it is not addressed in the given context.
