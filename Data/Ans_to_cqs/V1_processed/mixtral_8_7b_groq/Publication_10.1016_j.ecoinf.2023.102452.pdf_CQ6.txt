The provided context discusses various aspects of model development and data processing in the field of ecological informatics and civil engineering. However, it does not explicitly list the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. Nevertheless, based on general practices in deep learning, some common preprocessing steps include:

1. Data cleaning: This involves removing or correcting erroneous, missing, or irrelevant data points to ensure the quality of the dataset.

2. Normalization/Scaling: Deep learning models, especially those involving optimization techniques, can be sensitive to the scale of input features. Thus, it is common to normalize or scale features to a similar range, often between 0 and 1, using techniques such as min-max scaling.

3. Feature extraction/Selection: This process helps in reducing the dimensionality of the dataset and improving model performance by selecting the most relevant features. In the context, wavelet packet energy-entropy feature extraction and principal component analysis are mentioned as techniques for signal classification.

4. Data splitting: The dataset is typically divided into training, validation, and testing sets to evaluate model performance and prevent overfitting.

While these steps are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, it does discuss the importance of preprocessing methods and the interplay between ecological factors and model performance. For instance, the paper by Dehghani et al. (2023) compares LSTM, CNN, and ConvLSTM for hourly short-term streamflow forecasting, implying that some form of preprocessing was applied to the data. Similarly, the paper by Feng et al. (2017) discusses a data-driven multi-model methodology with deep feature selection for short-term wind forecasting.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not explicitly list the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, it emphasizes the importance of preprocessing methods and highlights various techniques used in related studies.
