Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context focuses on the materials and methods of various studies related to ecological informatics and land use policy in China, without mentioning the technical details of deep learning model training.

However, it is generally assumed that deep learning model training involves the use of specialized hardware such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) to accelerate the computations. These hardware resources are capable of performing parallel computations, which is essential for training large and complex deep learning models. Therefore, it is likely that the researchers used similar hardware for training their deep learning models.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, it is common practice to use GPUs or TPUs for this purpose.
