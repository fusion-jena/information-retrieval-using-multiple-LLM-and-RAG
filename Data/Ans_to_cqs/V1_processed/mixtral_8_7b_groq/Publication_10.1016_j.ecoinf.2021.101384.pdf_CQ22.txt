The provided context does not give specific information about the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the vessel data used in the study come from the Global Fishing Watch (GFW) organization, which provides global-scale fishing data aggregated at a 0.01 resolution with fishing activity cells already classified through a machine learning model.

Typically, when evaluating the performance of a deep learning model for classification tasks, metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are used. Accuracy is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions. Precision is the ratio of true positives (correctly predicted positive instances) to the sum of true positives and false positives (incorrectly predicted positive instances). Recall is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives (incorrectly predicted negative instances). The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall and provides a balanced assessment of the model's performance.

Therefore, it is possible that the deep learning model used in the study was evaluated using one or more of these metrics. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
