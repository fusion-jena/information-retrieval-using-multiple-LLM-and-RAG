Based on the provided context, the deep learning model for BirdNET, a bird vocalization detection and classification system, is built using a deep neural network. However, the specific deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) used to develop this deep neural network is not explicitly mentioned in the context. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.

It is important to note that the choice of deep learning framework can significantly impact the development process, including factors such as ease of use, computational efficiency, and scalability. Common deep learning frameworks include TensorFlow, developed by Google, and PyTorch, developed by Facebook. Both of these frameworks have large communities and extensive resources for deep learning model development.

In summary, while the specific deep learning framework used for BirdNET is not specified in the provided context, it is likely that a well-established framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch was used due to their widespread use and robust capabilities for deep learning model development.
