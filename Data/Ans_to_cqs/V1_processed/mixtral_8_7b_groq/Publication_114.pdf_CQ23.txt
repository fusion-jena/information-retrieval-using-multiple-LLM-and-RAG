The text provided does not give explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the study used high-resolution RGB images and LiDAR data, which suggests that the model was trained on a diverse dataset. The use of LiDAR data, which provides 3D information about the trees, likely increased the diversity of the dataset and helped the model to learn more robust features.

Additionally, the authors mention that the method is applicable for other scales, depending on the quadrat size in the field work or the requirements of species diversity estimation. This suggests that the model was tested on different scales, which is another way to ensure its generalizability.

However, the text does not mention the use of cross-validation or stratified splitting, which are common techniques used to ensure the generalizability of deep learning models. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into multiple subsets, training the model on one subset and testing it on another, and repeating this process for all subsets. This helps to ensure that the model is not overfitting to the training data and can generalize well to new data. Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets while preserving the class distribution, which can help to ensure that the model is trained on a diverse and representative sample of the data.

Therefore, while the study likely took some measures to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the text does not provide enough information to make a definitive conclusion.
