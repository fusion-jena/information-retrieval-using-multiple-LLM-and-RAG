Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, the context does provide information about a study that involves the prediction of species intensity maps using various methods, including knn, CoinF, LoopT, LoopA, and others. The study uses figures to display the predicted intensities, but it does not specify the original data format.

From the context, it can be inferred that the input data used in the study is likely in the form of spatial observations or spatial data points, possibly with associated features or attributes. The study focuses on predicting the intensity of species based on these spatial observations while dealing with observer bias from a road network. The methods used for prediction include knn (k-nearest neighbors), CoinF (coin flipping), LoopT (loop transition), LoopA (loop all), and others. The predicted intensities are then evaluated using performance measures such as meanRSS (mean residual sum of squares) and relabeling performance.

Given that the study involves spatial data, it is plausible that the original data format is a geospatial data format, such as GeoJSON, Shapefile, or GeoTIFF. Alternatively, the data could have been in a tabular format, such as CSV, with geospatial coordinates and associated features.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that the input data is likely in a geospatial data format or a tabular format with geospatial coordinates. The focus of the study is on predicting species intensity based on spatial observations while addressing observer bias.
