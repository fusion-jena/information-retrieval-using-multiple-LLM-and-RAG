Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete for the classification models. Commonly used criteria to determine training completion include a validation loss plateau, early stopping, or reaching a predefined number of epochs. However, the text only mentions that the best-performing models and training parameters were identified during experimentation, and testing sets were used to evaluate the classifiers' performance on unseen data. It does not provide details about the training process or the stopping criteria. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
