The provided context does not give specific information about the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of Kaleidoscope Pro for sound detection and the creation of more advanced classifiers using machine learning or convolutional neural networks in future studies. These techniques could potentially be used to address data bias.

For example, in the context of sound detection, stratified sampling could be used during data collection to ensure that the dataset includes a diverse range of sounds from different geographical locations. This would help to ensure that the model is not biased towards sounds from a particular region.

Additionally, oversampling or undersampling techniques could be used during preprocessing to address class imbalance in the dataset. For instance, if the dataset contains many more examples of one type of sound than another, oversampling the minority class or undersampling the majority class could help to improve the model's performance.

The creation of more advanced classifiers using machine learning or convolutional neural networks could also help to reduce data bias. These techniques can potentially learn more complex patterns in the data and be more robust to noise and outliers, which could help to improve the model's performance on underrepresented classes.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific information about the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, it does suggest the use of diverse data collection, oversampling/undersampling, and advanced classifiers as potential approaches.
