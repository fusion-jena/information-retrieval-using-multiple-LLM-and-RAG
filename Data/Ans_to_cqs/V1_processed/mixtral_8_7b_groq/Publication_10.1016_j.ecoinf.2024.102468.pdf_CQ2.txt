The context provided does not explicitly mention the data format used in the described deep learning pipeline. However, based on the tasks and terminology used, it can be inferred that the input data is likely to be in an audio format.

The study focuses on blue whale vocalizations and noise signal classification. This implies that the original data might have been sound recordings, which were then processed to extract relevant features. These features are represented as vectors, updated using Gaussian parameters, and used for classification. Therefore, the initial data format was probably audio files, such as WAV or MP3, before being converted into a feature vector format for the machine learning model.

To summarize,


The input data in the described deep learning pipeline is likely to be in an audio format, representing blue whale vocalizations and noise signals. These audio files are processed to extract features, which are then converted into a vector format for the WT-HMM model.
