The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of a validation set, which consists of 176 image pairs selected from the original dataset. This validation set is used to assess the accuracy of the model during the training phase. Specifically, after every 10 epochs of training, the learning rate is halved, and the model's performance is evaluated on the validation set. This approach allows for the adjustment of the learning rate to optimize the model's performance and prevent overfitting. Additionally, the validation set provides an independent assessment of the model's generalization ability, ensuring that the model can accurately segment new, unseen data. Overall, the use of a validation set is a standard and effective strategy for monitoring model performance during training.
