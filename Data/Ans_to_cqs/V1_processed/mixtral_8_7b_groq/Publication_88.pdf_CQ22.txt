The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the following metrics: Overall Accuracy (OA), F1-Score, and Alarm Area (AA).

Overall Accuracy (OA) is a global metric that indicates the percentage of samples correctly classified in relation to the total samples. It is defined as the ratio of the sum of true positives (tp) and true negatives (tn) to the total number of predictions (P) plus the total number of actual classes (N). This metric provides a general understanding of how well the model is performing across all classes.

F1-Score is a harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics. Precision is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives. It measures the model's ability to not label negative samples as positive. Recall, on the other hand, is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives. It measures the model's ability to identify all positive samples. F1-Score combines these two metrics into a single value that ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating perfect precision and recall.

Alarm Area (AA) is a metric that is specific to the problem at hand, which involves detecting deforestation. AA measures the area of alarms raised by the model that do not correspond to actual deforestation events. This metric is useful for evaluating the model's ability to minimize false alarms, which is important for reducing the cost of manual verification and intervention.

These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the deep learning model's performance, allowing for an assessment of its overall accuracy, balance between precision and recall, and ability to minimize false alarms.
