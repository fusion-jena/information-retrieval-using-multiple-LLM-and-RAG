I regret to inform you that the provided context does not contain information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context consists of various data sets related to species distribution modeling, some of which are cited in academic papers, but there is no mention of a code repository or deep learning pipeline. It is possible that the pipeline was developed privately or the code repository is hosted on a different platform or was not shared publicly. I recommend reaching out to the authors of the Beery et al. (2021) paper for more information, as their work focuses on species distribution modeling for machine learning practitioners.
