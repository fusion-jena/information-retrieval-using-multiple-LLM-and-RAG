Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. However, it does mention the use of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform for processing and scaling environmental time series data.

Google Earth Engine is a cloud-based platform that provides a solution for storing and processing large volumes of satellite data. It offers advanced computational capabilities, making it suitable for handling big data and sequential process steps. Therefore, it is plausible that the trained deep learning model could be deployed on the GEE platform, taking advantage of its computational power and data storage capacity.

In the context of deep learning model deployment, model serialization is an essential step. Model serialization involves saving the trained model's architecture, weights, and biases to a file, allowing the model to be easily loaded and used for making predictions on new data. Common model serialization formats include HDF5, JSON, and Protocol Buffers. However, without further information, it is not possible to determine the specific format used for serializing the deep learning model.

As for platform selection, the provided context suggests that the Google Earth Engine platform was used for processing and scaling the time series data. While the text does not explicitly mention deploying the deep learning model on GEE, it is possible that the model was deployed on this platform, given its computational capabilities and data storage capacity.

In summary, while the provided context does not offer explicit information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, it can be inferred that the model could be deployed on the Google Earth Engine platform, taking advantage of its computational power and data storage capacity. Model serialization is an essential step in deep learning model deployment, but the specific format used for serializing the model is not mentioned in the context.
