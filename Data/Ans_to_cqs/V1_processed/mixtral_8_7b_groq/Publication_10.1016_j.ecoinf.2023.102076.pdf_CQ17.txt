The provided context does not mention any specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of pre-trained language models, such as BERT, for text classification. These models are fine-tuned on specific tasks and datasets, which can help to prevent overfitting by leveraging the knowledge and generalization abilities learned during pre-training.

In the context of the study, the authors used BERT for text classification and addressed the issue of imbalanced datasets by employing a hierarchical classification approach. They also used a relatively small number of training examples (less than 500) to achieve high classification accuracy, suggesting that the fine-tuning of pre-trained models can be effective even with limited data.

While the context does not provide specific information on regularization methods, it is important to note that overfitting can be a significant issue in deep learning pipelines, especially when working with small or imbalanced datasets. Regularization techniques, such as dropout, L2 regularization, and early stopping, can help to mitigate overfitting by introducing constraints and penalties during model training.

In summary, the provided context does not mention any specific regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it highlights the use of pre-trained language models and a hierarchical classification approach for text classification, which can help to prevent overfitting. Additionally, it is crucial to consider regularization techniques when developing deep learning pipelines to ensure model generalization and prevent overfitting.
