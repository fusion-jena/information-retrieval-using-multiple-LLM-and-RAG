The provided context discusses various techniques used for model evaluation, hyperparameter search, and data partitioning in deep learning-based models for remote sensing data. However, it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. Therefore, I will provide a general overview of some common techniques used to address data bias in a deep learning pipeline.

1. Stratified sampling: Stratified sampling is a method of sampling that ensures each subset (training, validation, or testing) has a proportional representation of all classes present in the dataset. This method helps maintain the balance of classes and reduces bias in the model's learning process.

2. Oversampling: Oversampling is a technique used to increase the number of instances from the minority class to balance the dataset. This method can help the model learn more about the underrepresented class and reduce bias. However, oversampling may lead to overfitting if not done carefully.

3. Undersampling: Undersampling is a technique used to decrease the number of instances from the majority class to balance the dataset. This method can help reduce the impact of the majority class on the model's learning process. However, undersampling may lead to loss of valuable information if not done carefully.

4. Diverse data collection: Collecting diverse data is a crucial step in reducing bias in the deep learning pipeline. Ensuring that the dataset includes a wide variety of samples from different sources, locations, and conditions can help the model generalize better and reduce bias.

5. Data augmentation: Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the size of the training dataset by applying random transformations (e.g., rotation, scaling, flipping) to the existing data. This method can help the model learn invariance to these transformations and reduce bias.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, some common techniques include stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, diverse data collection, and data augmentation. These methods can help reduce bias in the deep learning pipeline and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.
