I'm sorry for any confusion, but the provided context does not include information about a specific code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the use of deep learning models, particularly LSTM neural networks, for carbon emission forecasting and the benefits of hyperparameter optimization using the TPEBO algorithm. However, it does not offer a link to a code repository. For more specific information about the implementation of this deep learning pipeline, you may need to refer to the original research articles or contact the authors directly.
