I am unable to provide the data repository link for the deep learning pipeline as it is not mentioned in the given context. The context provides information about a research study that uses a deep learning-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for species distribution modeling (SDM) of the plant species Rhododendron arboreum. The study compares the performance of the CNN model with a traditional SDM called BIOCLIM. However, the context does not mention any link to a data repository or the deep learning pipeline used in the study.
