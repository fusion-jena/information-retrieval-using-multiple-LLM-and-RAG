To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken, including creating a diverse dataset, employing data augmentation, and utilizing a specific data splitting strategy.

First, a diverse dataset was constructed by gathering a substantial number of images (4000) for the training set, which represented the majority of the data (82%). This allowed the model to learn from a wide range of examples and patterns within the data. Additionally, a validation set consisting of 607 images (13%) was utilized during training to fine-tune hyperparameters and assess the model's performance on unseen data. This step helped prevent overfitting and ensured that the model could generalize well. Lastly, a testing set, independent of the training and validation sets, was used to evaluate the model's performance on completely unseen data. This provided a reliable measure of its real-world effectiveness.

Data augmentation was another crucial measure taken to enhance the model's generalizability. Specifically, random saturation adjustments were introduced to each training example, increasing the number of outputs per example to two. This augmentation strategy contributed to a more comprehensive and robust training dataset by introducing variations in color.

In terms of data splitting strategy, the dataset was divided into three sets: training, validation, and testing. The training set, with 82% of the data, was used to train the model and adjust its parameters. The validation set, consisting of 13% of the data, was utilized during training to fine-tune hyperparameters and assess the model's performance on unseen data. The testing set, which included the remaining 5% of the data, served as an independent evaluation of the model's performance on completely unseen data, providing a reliable measure of its real-world effectiveness and generalization ability.

It is important to note that no explicit mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting was found in the provided context. However, the described data splitting strategy and data augmentation techniques collectively contribute to the model's generalizability.
