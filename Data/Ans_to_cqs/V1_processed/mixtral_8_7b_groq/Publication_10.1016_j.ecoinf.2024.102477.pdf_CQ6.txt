Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved, including normalization, scaling, and cleaning.

Normalization is the process of rescaling numeric data values to a common range, often between 0 and 1. This step is essential because deep learning models are sensitive to the scale of input features. If the features have different scales, the model may weigh some features more heavily than others, leading to suboptimal performance. Normalization ensures that all features are on a similar scale, allowing the model to learn effectively from each feature.

Scaling is another preprocessing step that involves resizing the range of numeric data. Unlike normalization, scaling does not necessarily rescale data to a common range. Instead, scaling can be used to transform data to a specific range that is optimal for the deep learning model. For example, some deep learning models perform better when input features are scaled to a range of -1 to 1.

Cleaning is the process of removing or correcting errors, inconsistencies, and outliers in the data. This step is crucial because deep learning models can be sensitive to noisy data, leading to suboptimal performance. Cleaning can involve removing duplicate data, filling in missing values, correcting inconsistent data, and removing outliers that may skew the model's performance.

In addition to these preprocessing steps, data may also be transformed or engineered to improve model performance. For example, data may be transformed using logarithmic or polynomial functions to better capture nonlinear relationships between features. New features may also be engineered from existing data to improve model performance.

In summary, before training a deep learning model, data is typically preprocessed through normalization, scaling, and cleaning. These steps are essential for ensuring that the model can learn effectively from the data and for improving model performance. Additionally, data may be transformed or engineered to better capture nonlinear relationships and improve model performance.
