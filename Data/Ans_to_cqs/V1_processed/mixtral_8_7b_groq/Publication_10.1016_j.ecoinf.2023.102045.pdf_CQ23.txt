Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, some of the papers discuss methods that contribute to the generalizability of models in machine learning and data analysis.

1. Diverse dataset: Rocchini et al. (2021) developed the rasterdiv package for measuring ecosystem heterogeneity from space, which involves working with diverse datasets. A diverse dataset can help ensure that the deep learning model can generalize well to new, unseen data.

2. Cross-validation: Although not specifically mentioned in the context, cross-validation is a common technique used to assess the performance and generalizability of machine learning models. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into multiple subsets, training the model on one subset, and testing it on another. This process is repeated for all subsets, providing an estimate of the model's performance on unseen data.

3. Stratified splitting: Spalding (1999) discussed color vision deficiency in the medical profession, which highlights the importance of considering different perspectives and data representations. In machine learning, stratified splitting can be used to ensure that the training and testing datasets contain a similar distribution of classes or labels. This can help prevent the model from being overfitted to a specific class distribution and improve its generalizability.

4. Appropriate visualization: Rogowitz et al. (1996) and Stoelzle and Stein (2021) discussed the importance of appropriate visualization techniques in data analysis. While not directly related to deep learning model generalizability, appropriate visualization can help researchers identify potential issues, biases, or limitations in their data, which can ultimately lead to more robust and generalizable models.


Although the provided context does not contain specific information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, it discusses several related methods, such as using diverse datasets, cross-validation, stratified splitting, and appropriate visualization techniques. These methods can contribute to the development of a generalizable deep learning model.
