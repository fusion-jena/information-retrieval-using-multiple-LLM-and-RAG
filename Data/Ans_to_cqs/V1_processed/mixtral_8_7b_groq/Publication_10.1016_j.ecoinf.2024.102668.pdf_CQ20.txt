Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. The context focuses on the use of ecoacoustic indices (EAI) in audio signal processing for songbird detection and monitoring, comparing different audio recording systems and their performance. It discusses the need to reduce device bias in EAIs for broader comparative analyses, including machine learning and deep learning applications. However, it does not mention any specific hardware resources used for training deep learning models.
