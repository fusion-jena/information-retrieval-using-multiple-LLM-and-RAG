Based on the provided context, the text does not discuss deep learning models or their specific applications such as classification, segmentation, or detection. Instead, it focuses on species distribution models (SDMs) in the context of ecology and environmental science.

In the given context, the purpose of the SDMs is to estimate the potential geographic distribution of a species using presence sites (locations where the species has been observed) and background sites (locations where the species is known to be absent or not observed). Due to the scarcity of species or inadequate number of species records, the number of presence sites used to build the SDMs is often limited, leading to sampling bias. To address this issue, the authors use two criteria for data transformation: the dataset concerned with the transformation (presence or background sites) and the implementation spaces of the transformation (geographical or environmental feature space).

The text also introduces the concept of Dmin, which is a parameter set based on prior knowledge of the species' biology. Dmin is defined as the minimum distance between presence sites (P) and background sites (U) in the environmental space.

Lastly, the text defines the sampling effort for pixel i, denoted as zi, as the ratio of the sum of the weights of the sampled pixels (S) to the sum of the weights of all pixels (X) in the study area.

In summary, the provided context discusses species distribution models, their data transformation techniques, and the concept of Dmin and sampling effort. However, it does not mention deep learning models or their specific applications.
