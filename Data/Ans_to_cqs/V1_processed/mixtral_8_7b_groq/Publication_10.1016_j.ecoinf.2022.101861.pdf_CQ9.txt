Based on the provided context, there is no information about a specific deep learning pipeline or a data repository for it. The context discusses the use of a machine-learning powered BirdNET app and a public, citizen-based, birdsong repository called Xeno-canto, which hosts over 714,000 recordings of 10,300 bird species. However, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a data repository for it in Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
