The provided context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it does mention the use of an artificial neural network (ANN) with one hidden layer in a specific study (Bellin et al., 2022). ANNs are a type of deep learning model, but they do not fall into the category of more complex models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or Transformers.

The context also discusses the use of various machine learning (ML) methods, including some that can be used with deep learning models, such as random forest (RF), gradient boosting machine (GBM), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and light GBM (LGBM). However, it does not specify whether these models are used as part of a deep learning pipeline or as standalone models.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to definitively answer what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline.
