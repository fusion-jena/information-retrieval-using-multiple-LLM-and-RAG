Based on the provided context, there is no information that a deep learning model was deployed, and the process of model serialization or platform selection was followed. Instead, the article describes the use of a machine learning ensemble model for predicting the Resource Selection Index (RSI) for Short-billed Gulls (Larus canus) using data from a Geographic Information System (GIS) and socio-economic variables.

The machine learning ensemble model was built using three algorithms: RandomForest, Treenet, and CART. The authors used open access data and multi-year fieldwork to train the model. The model diagnostics were assessed using partial dependence plots for the top-ranked predictors, including soil type, vegetation class, and distance to water.

The model diagnostics table shows the importance rank of predictors, including various demographic and socio-economic variables such as population per mile, household income, and housing units. However, the context does not provide information on how the model was deployed or the platform selection process.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query regarding the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
