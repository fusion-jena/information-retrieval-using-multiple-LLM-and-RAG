The deep learning models mentioned in the context are used for image segmentation tasks. Specifically, Unet, Pspnet, and DeepLabV3+ are applied to address geographical and ecological challenges.

Unet is a model that extends the end-to-end concept of FCN by incorporating an encoder-decoder structure with shortcut connections. It is proficient in achieving accurate results while requiring a smaller number of training samples.

Pspnet, on the other hand, employs a spatial pyramid module to gather contextual data from diverse regions, enabling the acquisition of comprehensive global information.

DeepLabV3+ integrates an asymmetric spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) architecture within an encoder-decoder framework, effectively merging multi-scale information. This integration aids in precise object boundary detection, which is particularly useful in image segmentation tasks.

In the case of DeeplabV3+, it is used for semantic segmentation tasks in the encoding stage of the DeeplabV3+ model. The backbone network is replaced with Mobilenetv2 featuring expanded convolution, which ensures higher accuracy and enhances the model's lightweight nature. Additionally, the ASPP module is incorporated into the encoder-decoder network to obtain feature maps with reduced dimensions, which are then concatenated and passed through a 1 Ã— 1 convolution block before being inputted into the Decoder module.

Therefore, these deep learning models are used for image segmentation tasks, specifically for addressing geographical and ecological challenges by gathering contextual data, merging multi-scale information, and achieving accurate results while requiring a smaller number of training samples.
