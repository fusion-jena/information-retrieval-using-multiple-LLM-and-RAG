Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, the context does describe a process of harmonizing habitat classes within the Geographic Modelling for Environmental Planning (GMEP) to generate GMEPmod using Earth Observation (EO) data. This harmonization process involves the use of contextual datasets to absorb certain classes into appropriate wetland classes, reducing discrepancies with GMEP data.

In this context, the habitat classes are annotated at a coarse level, such as broadleaved woodland, needle-leaved woodland, improved grassland, arable crops, bracken, acid grassland, neutral grassland, calcareous grassland, dry dwarf shrub heath, wet dwarf shrub heath, fen, marshy grassland, and swamp, among others. However, the specific data annotation techniques used for this coarse-level annotation are not mentioned.

Common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines for computer vision tasks include:

1. Image-level annotation: In this technique, each image is annotated with a single label, indicating the dominant object class in the image.
2. Bounding box annotation: Here, each object of interest in an image is enclosed in a bounding box, and the coordinates of the bounding box are recorded.
3. Semantic segmentation: In this technique, each pixel in an image is annotated with a class label, indicating the object class to which the pixel belongs.
4. Instance segmentation: This is a more advanced form of semantic segmentation, where each instance of an object class is distinguished from other instances of the same class.

Given the coarse level of annotation in the provided context, it is likely that image-level annotation or bounding box annotation techniques were used. However, without explicit information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
