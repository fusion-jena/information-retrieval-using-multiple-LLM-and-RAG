Based on the provided context, the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned. However, we can infer that the database integrates various types of data, including DEM (Digital Elevation Model), SLOP (slope), SOIL (soil), Vegetation type, Human Activity (HA) data, climate data, geographic data, and Vegetation data.

The data types include:

1. Raster data: DEM, SLOP, SOIL, Vegetation type, and average values of climate data (temperature, precipitation, evapotranspiration) are likely stored in raster format, which is common for spatial data.
2. Vector data: HA, geographic data, and Vegetation data might be stored as vector data, which is suitable for representing discrete features like buildings, roads, and vegetation patches.
3. Tabular data: Average annual human density, economic density, land use intensity, and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) are possibly stored as tabular data in CSV or similar formats, as they represent statistical summaries and do not have a spatial component.

However, the context does not provide information on audio, video, or other specific formats like JSON or parquet. It is essential to refer to the original study or data source for detailed information on data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.


The provided context suggests that the integrated database contains raster, vector, and tabular data, including DEM, SLOP, SOIL, Vegetation type, climate data, HA, geographic data, and Vegetation data. However, specific formats like image, audio, video, or other formats such as JSON or parquet are not explicitly mentioned. For detailed information on data formats, it is recommended to consult the original study or data source.
