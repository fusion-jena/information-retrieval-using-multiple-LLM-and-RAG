Based on the provided context, the raw data used in the deep learning pipeline for image processing and analysis in fisheries is typically collected through digital imaging, such as through the use of cameras or sensors. The specific mention in the context is about the use of digital images for classification purposes. However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of surveys or public datasets for raw data collection. Instead, it highlights the challenge of limited dataset size and the use of existing deep learning techniques to overcome this limitation.

The 1980s method for sorting referred to in the context likely involved the use of digital images captured through cameras or sensors mounted on fishing vessels or equipment. The need to overcome the limitation of a small number of labeled images in each category suggests that the raw data was collected through digital imaging, and the challenge was in obtaining a sufficient quantity of annotated data for training deep learning models.

In summary, the raw data in the deep learning pipeline for image processing and analysis in fisheries is primarily collected through digital imaging, such as cameras or sensors. The context does not explicitly mention the use of surveys or public datasets for raw data collection. Instead, it highlights the challenge of limited dataset size and the use of existing deep learning techniques to overcome this limitation.
