The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is stated explicitly in the first piece of context, which mentions a "CNN used in the study" and provides a schematic of the CNN's architecture. The CNN was trained using standard deep learning techniques on a Tesla M100 graphic processing unit. The authors considered other types of models, such as segmentation-based approaches, but these were not pursued due to a lack of sufficient quality training data. Therefore, the final pipeline employs a CNN for image classification.
