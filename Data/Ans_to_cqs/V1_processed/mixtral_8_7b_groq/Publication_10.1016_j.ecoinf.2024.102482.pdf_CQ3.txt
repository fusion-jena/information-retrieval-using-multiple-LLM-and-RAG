Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, the context does mention the use of certain data features in relation to deep learning models.

In the paper by Cho et al. (2014), the authors use a recurrent neural network (RNN) encoder-decoder for statistical machine translation, which likely involves some form of text annotation or tokenization. However, the specific annotation technique is not mentioned.

The paper by Concepcion et al. (2023) uses a hybrid deep neural network for common cockle geographical traceability based on shell image analysis. While the paper discusses feature extraction from the shell images, it does not mention any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

The context also discusses the use of the BLS entropy profile to characterize the swimming behavior of Caenorhabditis elegans, as in the work by Jeong et al. (2019). However, it does not mention any data annotation techniques used in relation to this profile.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot provide a specific answer to the query about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
