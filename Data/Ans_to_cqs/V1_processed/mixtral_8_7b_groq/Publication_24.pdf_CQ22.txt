The provided context discusses the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for ecoacoustic assessment, but it does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, based on common practices in machine learning, we can infer some possible metrics that might have been used.

 Based on the provided context, the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are not mentioned. However, it is common to use various evaluation metrics in machine learning, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions made. Precision focuses on the positive predictions and is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives. Recall, on the other hand, is the ratio of true positive predictions to the actual number of positive instances in the data. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics. Given the nature of the study, it is likely that the authors used one or more of these metrics to assess the performance of their deep learning model.
