The provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The texts mention two studies by D. Luna-Naranjo et al., one from 2024 and another from an unspecified year, but they do not indicate where the data used in those studies is stored.

The first text describes the results of applying a coherence measure to data from site S2. However, it does not provide any details about the data repository or the deep learning pipeline.

The second text provides information about several audio recordings made in different locations in Colombia, using AudioMoth recorders with a sampling frequency of 48 kHz and medium gain. The recordings were made at various dates between 2019 and 2022. However, there is no mention of a data repository or a deep learning pipeline in this text either.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline.
