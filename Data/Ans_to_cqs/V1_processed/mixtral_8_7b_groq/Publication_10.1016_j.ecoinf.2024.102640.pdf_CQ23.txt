The generalizability of the deep learning model in GreenCam was addressed through several measures, as described in the provided context. 

Firstly, the model was trained on a diverse dataset. The dataset's geographic scope was expanded to include a wide range of urban settings, different types of green spaces, and varying levels of urban green density. This diversity in data helped the model to learn from various scenarios, thereby improving its ability to generalize.

Secondly, data augmentation techniques were implemented to address underrepresented classes and improve the balance of the dataset. These techniques include random rotations, scaling, and flipping of images. These augmentations helped in creating more variations of the existing data, thereby enhancing the model's ability to handle new, unseen data.

Thirdly, the model was trained using a Transformer-based encoder (MiT) and a lightweight decoder (ALL-MLP) composed entirely of multilayer perceptron (MLP) blocks. This encoder-decoder structure allows the model to learn complex representations from the data, further aiding in its generalizability.

Lastly, the context mentions plans for future improvements, which include expanding the dataset (UGE-D) to include photos from different cities and climates. This will enrich the dataset with a broader range of urban environmental conditions, thereby enhancing the model's ability to generalize.

However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of cross-validation or stratified splitting. While these techniques are commonly used to ensure the generalizability of models, their use is not explicitly stated in this case.
