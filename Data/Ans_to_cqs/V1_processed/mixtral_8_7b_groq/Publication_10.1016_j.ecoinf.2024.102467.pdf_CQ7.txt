The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training typically include creating separate sets for training, validation, and testing. However, the provided context does not mention specific criteria for splitting the data.

In general, the training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and make decisions during the model building process, and the test set is used to evaluate the model's performance.

The context does mention that the number of parameters is reduced while ensuring detection accuracy. This could imply that a portion of the data is used for training and another portion is used for validation to ensure that the model's performance is not compromised despite the reduction in parameters.

Moreover, the EfficientNetV2 network is designed to reduce model complexity while preserving accuracy. This could suggest that the data splitting criteria take into account the need to maintain accuracy even with a smaller number of parameters.

In the context of ecological informatics and animal detection, it is possible that the data is split based on factors such as the distribution of animal species, habitat types, or other relevant ecological variables.

Overall, while the provided context does not mention specific criteria for splitting the data, it suggests that the criteria used take into account the need to maintain accuracy and efficiency in model training and evaluation.
