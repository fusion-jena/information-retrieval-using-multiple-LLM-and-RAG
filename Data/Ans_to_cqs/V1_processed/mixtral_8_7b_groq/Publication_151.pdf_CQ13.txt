The provided context does not give specific information about the learning rate or the optimizer used in the deep learning model. However, it does mention some other hyperparameters and training details. The embedding size k is set to 128 for data sets with 200 taxon and 512 for larger data sets. The batch size is fixed to 32. The training loss is checked every 50 epochs, and training is stopped when the value of the loss function fails to decrease in two consecutive checks. The model with the optimal objective function value is chosen. The deep learning model is implemented using PyTorch and treeswift python packages, and trained on 2080Ti NVIDIA GPUs. Other hyperparameters are fixed to their defaults, but the specific values are not provided in the context.
