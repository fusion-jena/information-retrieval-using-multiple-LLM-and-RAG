Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the data was split for training the deep learning model (e.g., into training, validation, and test sets). However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to split the data into these three subsets to ensure the model's generalization, monitor its performance during training, and evaluate its performance on unseen data.

Typically, the data is split into three subsets:

1. Training set: This is the portion of the data used to train the model. The model learns patterns from this data and adjusts its parameters to minimize the loss function.

2. Validation set: Also known as the development set, this data is used during the training process to validate the model's performance on unseen data. The validation set helps in tuning hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and regularization coefficients. It also helps in identifying overfitting or underfitting issues.

3. Test set: This is the final, unseen data used to evaluate the model's performance. The test set provides an unbiased estimate of how the model will perform on new, real-world data.

While the context does not provide specific details about the data splitting, it does mention the use of several datasets (UCCS, C-60, and U45) for quantitative comparisons. It is possible that the data for these comparisons were not split, as they were likely used only for reporting the performance of different models. However, for training and evaluating the deep learning model, it is essential to follow the data splitting procedure mentioned above.
