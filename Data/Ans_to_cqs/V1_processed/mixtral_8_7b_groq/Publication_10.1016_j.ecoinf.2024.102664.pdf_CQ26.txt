The provided context does not directly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the importance of optimizing and refining machine learning models for specific issues, such as algal bloom forecasting in the Zhoushan fishery. This process may involve addressing data bias indirectly.

In the context of algal bloom forecasting, data bias could arise from various sources, such as uneven distribution of algal bloom data across seasons, spatial locations, or environmental conditions. To address these potential biases, several preprocessing techniques could be applied, including:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the data into subgroups based on specific criteria (e.g., seasons, spatial locations, or environmental conditions) and then randomly sampling from each subgroup to ensure a balanced representation in the training, validation, and test datasets.

2. Oversampling: If certain classes or categories are underrepresented in the dataset, oversampling can be used to increase their presence. This can be done by replicating existing instances or using techniques like Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to create new instances based on existing data.

3. Undersampling: Conversely, if certain classes or categories are overrepresented in the dataset, undersampling can be used to reduce their presence. This can be done by randomly removing instances from the majority class or using techniques like NearMiss to select instances from the majority class that are close to the minority class.

4. Diverse data collection: To minimize data bias, it is essential to collect diverse and representative data. This may involve gathering data from various sources, seasons, spatial locations, and environmental conditions to ensure a comprehensive and unbiased dataset.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention these techniques, they are commonly used in machine learning and deep learning to address data bias during preprocessing. By employing these methods, researchers can improve the predictive performance and generalizability of their models.
