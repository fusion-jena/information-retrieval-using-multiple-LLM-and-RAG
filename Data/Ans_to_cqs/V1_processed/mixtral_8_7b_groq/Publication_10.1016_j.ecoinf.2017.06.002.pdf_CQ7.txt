The provided context does not give specific criteria for splitting data into training, testing, and validation sets for deep learning model training. However, it does offer some insights into how data is organized and described, which could inform the data splitting process.

In general, the data seems to be organized around several key factors: measurement location (Site_ID, Plot_ID, Location_ID), measurement position (Meas_Pos_ID), sensor used (Sensor_FieldName), and measurement campaign details (sample-based or automatically-generated data files). Each data file has a corresponding Data_Column_Description that details the measurements and provides a Meas_Pos_ID for the data columns.

When splitting the data for deep learning, it is essential to maintain the integrity of these relationships and ensure that each subset (train, test, validation) contains a diverse and representative sample of the data. Here are some possible approaches based on the given context:

1. **Location-based splitting**: Divide the data based on the measurement location (Site_ID, Plot_ID, Location_ID). This ensures that each subset contains data from distinct locations, reducing the likelihood of data leakage between subsets.

2. **Time-based splitting**: Split the data based on the measurement time, such as start, middle, or end of the sampling period. This approach can help capture temporal dependencies and variations in the data.

3. **Sensor-based splitting**: Divide the data based on the sensor used (Sensor_FieldName). This can help account for potential differences in sensor performance or calibration.

4. **Campaign-based splitting**: Split the data based on the measurement campaign details (sample-based or automatically-generated data files). This can help capture differences in measurement conditions or protocols.

5. **Hybrid splitting**: Combine multiple criteria, such as location, time, sensor, and campaign, to create a more diverse and representative split of the data.

Regardless of the chosen approach, it is crucial to ensure that each subset contains a sufficient number of samples to train, test, and validate the deep learning model effectively. Additionally, it is essential to maintain the balance between the subsets to avoid overfitting or underfitting issues.
