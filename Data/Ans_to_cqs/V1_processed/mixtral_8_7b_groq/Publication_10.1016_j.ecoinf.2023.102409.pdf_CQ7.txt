The context provided does not give specific information about the criteria used to split the data for training the deep learning model. The text mainly focuses on describing the details of a specific deep learning model used for image segmentation in arid regions.

However, generally, in deep learning model training, the data is typically split into three sets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and select the best model during the training process, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final model's performance.

The specific criteria for splitting the data can vary depending on the use case, dataset size, and other factors. Common methods for splitting the data include random sampling, stratified sampling, or temporal splitting. For instance, in a time-series dataset, you might choose to use the most recent data for testing, the data just before that for validation, and the rest for training.

In the context provided, the focus is on the model architecture and its parameters. The text mentions that the model was trained for 150 iterations, with a batch size of 4, and utilized SGD optimizer, ReLu activation function, and Dice loss function. However, it does not mention any specifics about the data splitting criteria.
