Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of any preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning that were carried out before training the deep learning model, which in this case is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). However, it is important to note that these preprocessing steps are generally recommended and often necessary for effective training of deep learning models.

Normalization and scaling are used to adjust the range of input variables so that they have similar scales, which can help the model to learn more effectively. This is because deep learning models, including ANNs, can be sensitive to the scale of the input features. Normalization and scaling can be applied in various ways, such as min-max scaling, z-score scaling, or normalization to unit length.

Cleaning of the data is also an important preprocessing step, as it can help to remove noise, outliers, or missing values that might negatively impact the model's performance. There are various techniques for data cleaning, such as imputation of missing values, removal of outliers, or handling of categorical variables.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention any preprocessing steps, it is likely that such steps were taken as part of the data preparation process before training the ANN. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
