The provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that the study used the Deep Neural Network (DNN) model, which is a type of deep learning algorithm. In general, data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in deep learning to increase the amount of training data, improve model performance, and prevent overfitting.

Flipping involves creating new training examples by horizontally or vertically flipping the original images. This technique can help the model learn invariance to the direction of the features in the image.

Rotating involves creating new training examples by rotating the original images by a certain angle. This technique can help the model learn invariance to the orientation of the features in the image.

Scaling involves creating new training examples by resizing the original images. This technique can help the model learn invariance to the scale of the features in the image.

Therefore, it is possible that the study used these data augmentation techniques in the deep learning pipeline, but the context does not provide enough information to confirm this.
