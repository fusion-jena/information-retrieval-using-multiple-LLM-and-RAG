Based on the information provided, there is no explicit mention of specific post-processing steps applied after the model training process. However, it is possible to infer some possible post-processing steps from the context.

The model design follows the Wide ResNet approach, which suggests that the post-processing steps might involve extracting features from the model's output and using them for further analysis. The output shape of the model is (987Ã—1), which indicates that the model produces a single vector of 987 features for each input sample.

The context also mentions the use of data augmentation techniques, such as diversifying the training data with a 3-s window length. This suggests that the post-processing steps might involve analyzing the performance of the model on the augmented data to evaluate its ability to generalize to new samples.

In addition, the model is designed for low-level feature classification, and the need for more advanced classifiers is mentioned. This implies that the post-processing steps might involve comparing the performance of this model to other more advanced models or classifiers.

Some possible post-processing steps that could be applied based on the context include:

1. Metrics calculation: Computing metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate the model's performance.
2. Confusion matrix: Creating a confusion matrix to visualize the model's performance and identify any classes that are particularly challenging for the model to classify.
3. Saliency maps: Generating saliency maps to visualize which features the model is using to make its predictions and identify any features that are particularly important for the model's performance.
4. Model comparison: Comparing the performance of this model to other more advanced models or classifiers to determine if more advanced techniques are necessary for this task.

Overall, while the context does not provide explicit information on the post-processing steps applied after the model training process, it is possible to infer some possible steps based on the model design and the tasks it is designed to perform.
