The provided context does not give specific information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. There is no mention of techniques such as grid search, random search, or any other method for hyperparameter tuning. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.

However, it is important to note that hyperparameter tuning is a crucial step in the development of machine learning models. The choice of hyperparameters can significantly impact the performance of the model. Therefore, it is likely that some form of hyperparameter tuning was performed during the development of the model described in the context.

In general, there are several techniques for hyperparameter tuning, including grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and gradient-based optimization. Grid search involves systematically trying out different combinations of hyperparameters within a predefined range. Random search involves randomly selecting hyperparameters within a predefined range. Bayesian optimization involves using a probabilistic model to guide the search for optimal hyperparameters. Gradient-based optimization involves using gradient descent or a similar optimization algorithm to adjust the hyperparameters based on the performance of the model.

Without more information about the specific model and the development process, it is difficult to say which of these techniques was used for hyperparameter tuning.
