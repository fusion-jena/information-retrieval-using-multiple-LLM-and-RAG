Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps applied after the model training. However, it can be inferred that metrics calculation and confusion matrix were used during the validation process.

In the context, it is mentioned that the accuracy of the models was calculated for both train and valid datasets at species, genus, and subfamily levels. The number of misclassified images was also provided, which could be used to create a confusion matrix.

However, there is no mention of saliency maps or any other visualization techniques used in the postprocessing steps.


The postprocessing steps involved after the model training, based on the provided context, include metrics calculation and confusion matrix for validation. There is no explicit information about the use of saliency maps or other visualization techniques.
