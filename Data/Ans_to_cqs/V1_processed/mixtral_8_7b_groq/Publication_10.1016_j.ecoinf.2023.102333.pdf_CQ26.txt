The provided context discusses various aspects of deep learning, including optimization algorithms, image processing, and remote sensing. However, it does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Nevertheless, I can provide some general techniques that are commonly used to address data bias, based on my understanding of the subject.

1. Stratified splitting: Stratified sampling is a method of sampling that aims to ensure each subset (or 'stratum') of the population is proportionally represented in the sample. In the context of deep learning, stratified splitting can be used during data splitting (e.g., training, validation, and testing) to ensure that each subset has a similar distribution of classes.

2. Oversampling: Oversampling is a technique used to increase the representation of the minority class in an imbalanced dataset. This can help the model learn more about the minority class and reduce bias. However, oversampling can lead to overfitting, so it's essential to use techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) that create synthetic samples instead of simply duplicating existing ones.

3. Undersampling: Undersampling is a technique used to decrease the representation of the majority class in an imbalanced dataset. While this can help reduce bias, it can also lead to loss of information. Therefore, it's essential to use techniques like NearMiss that select a subset of the majority class based on their similarity to the minority class.

4. Diverse data collection: Collecting diverse data is crucial for reducing bias in deep learning models. By collecting data from various sources, demographics, and geographical locations, we can ensure that the model is exposed to a wide range of variations in the data.

It's important to note that while these techniques can help reduce bias, they may not eliminate it entirely. Therefore, it's essential to continuously monitor and evaluate the model's performance and fairness throughout the development process.
