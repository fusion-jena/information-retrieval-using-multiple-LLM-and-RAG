The context provided does not give information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses various deep learning models and techniques used for seagrass coverage estimation, seagrass distribution mapping, and Posidonia oceanica seagrass mapping. However, it does not mention where the data or code for these pipelines is available.

The sources cited in the context include research papers published in various journals, but they do not provide a link to a data repository. For instance, Noman et al. (2021b) proposed using Faster R-CNN with the NASNet model for seagrass coverage estimation on the ECUHO-1 and ECUHO-2 datasets, but there is no information about the availability of the dataset or code. Similarly, Wang et al. (2020a) developed an encoder-decoder-based deep learning model for seagrass coverage estimation, but the data repository is not mentioned.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query as the context does not contain the necessary information. I would recommend contacting the authors of the research papers or checking their affiliated institutions' repositories for the data and code.
