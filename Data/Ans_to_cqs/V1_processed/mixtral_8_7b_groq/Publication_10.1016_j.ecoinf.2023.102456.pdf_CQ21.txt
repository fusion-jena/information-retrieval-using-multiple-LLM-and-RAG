After the model training process, several postprocessing steps are involved to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the model. These steps include the calculation of various metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, and the creation of confusion matrices.

The use of confusion matrices is particularly valuable in providing detailed information regarding both correct and incorrect classifications made by the model. This insight enables the identification of potential deficiencies in classifying specific classes or categories. The post-training evaluation results are presented through the use of figures and numerical data, with graphical visualizations effectively portraying the performance estimation achievement.

In addition to the metrics mentioned above, saliency maps can also be used as a postprocessing step to gain a better understanding of the model's decision-making process. Saliency maps highlight the most important features in the input data that the model relies on for its predictions. This visualization technique can be helpful in identifying potential biases or shortcomings in the model's feature selection.

Moreover, when applying classification models, handling missing values is an essential postprocessing step. Several techniques, such as imputation or using specialized algorithms that can handle missing data, can be employed to ensure the integrity of the model's predictions.

In the context of predicting forest fires, for example, Stojanova et al. (2006) used different data mining techniques to learn to predict forest fires. They evaluated their models using various metrics, including accuracy and the F1-score. Similarly, Földi and Kuti (2016) reviewed the main driving factors of forest fire ignition over Europe, which could be used as input features for a predictive model. They also discussed the impact of forest fires on the environment, emphasizing the importance of accurate predictions and postprocessing evaluation.

When working with imbalanced data, as is often the case in forest fire prediction, He and Garcia (2009) proposed learning from imbalanced data using techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, or generating synthetic data. These methods can help improve the model's performance and the reliability of the postprocessing evaluation.

In conclusion, postprocessing steps following model training include the calculation of various metrics, the creation of confusion matrices, the use of saliency maps, and handling missing values. These steps ensure a comprehensive assessment of the model's performance and effectiveness, enabling the identification of potential deficiencies and the improvement of the model's decision-making process.
