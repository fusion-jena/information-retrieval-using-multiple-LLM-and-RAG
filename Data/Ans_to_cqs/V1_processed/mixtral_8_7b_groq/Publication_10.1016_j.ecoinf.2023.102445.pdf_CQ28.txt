The text provided does not give information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model, such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. However, it does provide details about the experimental platform used for training the model. The experiments were conducted on a computer with an AMD Ryzen 7 5800H processor, a Radeon graphics card, and a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 Ti laptop GPU with 4 GB of video memory. The development environment consisted of the Windows 10 Enterprise operating system, Python version 3.7, CUDA version 11.6, and PyTorch deep learning framework version 1.12.0. It's possible that the model was trained and deployed on this local machine, rather than on a cloud-based platform.
