The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the performance of the models was evaluated using several metrics such as estimated weight, estimated efficiency, identified accuracy, root mean square error (RMSE), and mean relative error (MRE). These metrics were used to compare the performance of different models and configurations. For instance, the paper compares the performance of a deep learning-based system (DL-YOLO) with YOLOv5n, using metrics such as missing detection, bounding box deviation, and duplicate detection. Additionally, the authors report the RMSE and MRE for each model, which can serve as indicators of model performance during training. It can be assumed that the training process involved monitoring these metrics to assess and optimize the models' performance. However, the specific monitoring strategy is not provided in the context.
