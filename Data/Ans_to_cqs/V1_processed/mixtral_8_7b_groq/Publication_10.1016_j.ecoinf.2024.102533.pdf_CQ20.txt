The provided context does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it mentions a study that uses deep learning for automated fish grading (Jayasundara, J.M.V.D.B., et al., Dec. 2023). Therefore, it can be inferred that the researchers likely used hardware resources such as GPUs or TPUs to train the deep learning model, as these are commonly used for deep learning due to their ability to perform parallel processing, which significantly speeds up the training process. However, without explicit information, it is not possible to give a definitive answer.
