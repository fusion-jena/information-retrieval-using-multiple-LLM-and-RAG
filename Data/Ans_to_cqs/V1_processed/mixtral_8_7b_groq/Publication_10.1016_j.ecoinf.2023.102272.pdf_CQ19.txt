The provided context does not explicitly mention which frameworks were used to build the deep learning models. The text only refers to the models as "deep-ANN architecture types" and "deep learning approaches," without specifying the underlying frameworks. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question. However, it is worth noting that TensorFlow and PyTorch are two of the most commonly used frameworks for building deep learning models, so it is possible that one or both of these were used in this study.
