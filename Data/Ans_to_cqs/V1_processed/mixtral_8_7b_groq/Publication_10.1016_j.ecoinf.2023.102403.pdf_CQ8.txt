Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the analysis. The text focuses on the examination and refinement of biodiversity data repositories, specifically FishBase, GBIF, and OBIS, and details the methods used to clean and filter the dataset. However, it does not mention or provide a link to the code repository used in the analysis. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
