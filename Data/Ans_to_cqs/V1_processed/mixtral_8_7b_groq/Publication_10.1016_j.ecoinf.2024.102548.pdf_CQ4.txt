In the described deep learning pipeline, data augmentation techniques are applied to enhance the performance and generalization capability of the model. Specifically, for the diagnosis of diseases in okra leaves, the following data augmentation techniques are used:

1. Rotation: The training images are rotated up to 20 degrees. This technique helps the model to learn features invariant to different rotation angles, thereby improving its ability to recognize patterns in images with varying orientations.

2. Width and Height Shifting: The width and height of the training images are shifted up to 20% of the total image size. This technique enables the model to learn features that are not dependent on the exact position of the object in the image, enhancing its robustness to object location variations.

3. Shearing: The training images undergo shearing with a maximum of 20 degrees. Shearing is a transformation that slants the image, introducing a skewed perspective. This technique helps the model to learn features robust to different perspectives and angles.

4. Zooming: The training images are zoomed with a maximum factor of 20%. Zooming, or image magnification, allows the model to learn features at different scales, improving its ability to recognize patterns at various magnifications.

5. Horizontal Flipping: The training images are horizontally flipped. This technique creates a mirrored version of the image, helping the model to learn features that are symmetric along the horizontal axis.

For the test and validation data, the ImageDataGenerator instances rescaled the pixel values of the images by dividing each pixel by 255. This normalization technique ensures that all input images have similar pixel value ranges, preventing any single image from dominating the learning process due to its pixel value distribution.

In addition to these data augmentation techniques, the study also employs transfer learning, utilizing pre-trained models like MobileNet, EfficientNet, InceptionV3, and InceptionResNetV2. These models have been pre-trained on extensive datasets, enabling them to learn comprehensive feature representations and achieve high performance. By initializing the model with pre-trained weights from these models, the deep learning pipeline further enhances its learning capabilities and robustness.
