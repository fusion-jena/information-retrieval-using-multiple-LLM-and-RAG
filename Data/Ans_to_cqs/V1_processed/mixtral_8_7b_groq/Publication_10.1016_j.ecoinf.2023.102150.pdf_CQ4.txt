In the context provided, the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include shifts, horizontal flips, rotations, zooms, and shears. These techniques are used to expand the training dataset and improve the model's ability to generalize from the training data to new, unseen data. By applying these transformations to the images, the model is exposed to a wider variety of examples and can learn to recognize the features of the objects of interest (such as animals) regardless of their orientation or scale in the image. This can help to improve the accuracy and robustness of the model.
