The context does not provide specific details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning models developed by Wang et al., Perez et al., and Burguera. However, it does mention some techniques used during the training phase that are relevant for deployment.

Wang et al. developed an encoder-decoder based deep-learning model for estimating seagrass coverage, Perez et al. applied deep capsule network (DCN) and deep CNN models for seagrass distribution mapping, and Burguera developed two neural network models for Posidonia oceanica seagrass mapping. These models were trained on specific datasets, and no information is provided about how they were deployed.

However, the context does mention some techniques used during the training phase that are relevant for deployment. For instance, data augmentation was applied to increase the size and variability of the dataset, which is a common practice to prevent overfitting and improve model generalization. Techniques such as random cropping, horizontal/vertical flipping, image rotation, image translation, zooming, brightness adjustment, contrast adjustment, hue and saturation adjustment, Gaussian noise, and random erasing were applied.

Furthermore, the context mentions the use of EfficientDet, a state-of-the-art object detection model proposed by the Google Brain team. EfficientDet employs the EfficientNet backbone, which integrates a compound scaling technique that uniformly scales the resolution, depth, and width of the network, ensuring maximum accuracy and efficiency under limited computing resources. The EfficientDet family consists of a series of networks from EfficientDet-D0 to EfficientDet-D7, allowing for different accuracy and efficiency levels.

The architecture of EfficientDet includes an improved PANet named bidirectional feature pyramid, which allows for easy and fast multi-scale feature fusion. This feature can be beneficial during deployment, as it enables the model to handle objects of different scales and sizes.

In summary, while the context does not provide specific details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning models, it does mention some techniques used during the training phase that are relevant for deployment, such as data augmentation and the use of efficient architectures like EfficientDet. However, the deployment process may vary depending on the specific use case, platform, and requirements.
