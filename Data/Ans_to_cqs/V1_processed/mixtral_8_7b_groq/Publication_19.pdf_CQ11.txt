I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The context includes information about the hyperparameters used for training four different models, a comparison of their performance and sizes, and a brief introduction to the research topic. However, there is no mention of the data repository link. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to this query.
