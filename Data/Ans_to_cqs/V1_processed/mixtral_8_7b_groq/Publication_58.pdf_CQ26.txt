Based on the provided context, it is mentioned that the data sets used for training the architectures are balanced to address data bias. However, the specific techniques used for balancing the data sets during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly stated. The text only mentions that they "tried several methods" but found negligible differences in performance, and that they used the "median frequency balancing method."

The median frequency balancing method is a technique used for balancing class distributions in datasets, especially in the context of image segmentation. This method involves adjusting the number of samples in each class based on the median frequency of that class in the original dataset. This helps to ensure that each class has a roughly equal representation in the training data, which can improve the performance of deep learning models.

However, the context does not mention any other techniques such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.

Stratified sampling is a technique used for splitting a dataset into training and testing sets while preserving the distribution of classes. This can help to ensure that the training and testing sets are representative of the overall population, and can improve the generalizability of the model.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used for balancing class distributions in datasets by either adding or removing samples from a particular class. Oversampling involves adding more samples from the underrepresented classes, while undersampling involves removing samples from the overrepresented classes.

Diverse data collection involves collecting data from a variety of sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population. This can help to ensure that the model is able to generalize well to new, unseen data.

In summary, based on the provided context, the median frequency balancing method was used for balancing the class distributions in the dataset. However, other techniques such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection were not explicitly mentioned.
