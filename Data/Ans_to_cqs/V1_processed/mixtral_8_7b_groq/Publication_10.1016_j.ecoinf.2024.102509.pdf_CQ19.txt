Based on the provided context, the "neuralnet" package of R 4.1.2 software was considered for developing a Backpropagation Artificial Neural Network (BP-ANN) model. However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of any deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. It is possible that the authors did not use these frameworks for the development of their deep learning model, or they might have mentioned them in other parts of their study that were not included in the provided context. Therefore, based on the available information, it is not possible to definitively answer this question.
