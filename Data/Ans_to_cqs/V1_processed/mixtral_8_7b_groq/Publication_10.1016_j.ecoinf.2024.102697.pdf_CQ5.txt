The provided pieces of context do not include information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for detecting time-delay water quality indicators of wastewater treatment plant influent, as described in the study by Zhang et al., 2023.

The study may have used a proprietary or unnamed dataset, or it may have synthesized its own dataset for the purpose of the research. Without access to the full text of the study, it is not possible to determine the specific datasets used.

In general, deep learning models can be trained on a variety of datasets, including image datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet, as well as text, audio, and other types of data. The choice of dataset depends on the specific problem being addressed and the available data.

Therefore, while I cannot provide a specific answer to the query, I can say that deep learning models can be trained on a variety of datasets, and the choice of dataset depends on the specific problem and data availability.
