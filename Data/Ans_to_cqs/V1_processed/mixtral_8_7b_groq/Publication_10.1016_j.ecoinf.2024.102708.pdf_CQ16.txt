The criteria used to determine when training is complete is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the best model was selected based on the validation loss curve metrics, which implies that the model was trained until a certain point where the validation loss curve indicated good performance.

In the case of the YOLOv5s model, a plot of the validation loss curve is included, showing that training was completed after epoch 6. The validation loss curve is a useful tool to assess the performance of a model during training. Typically, training is considered complete when the validation loss plateaus or starts to increase, indicating that the model has learned the underlying patterns in the training data and is no longer improving its performance.

It is also worth noting that the validation loss curve was used to compare the performance of different models, suggesting that the criteria used to determine training completion was consistent across all models. However, the specific criteria used are not provided in the context.
