Based on the provided context, there are no specific saliency maps mentioned as a postprocessing step after the model training. However, the context does mention the calculation of certain metrics and the creation of a confusion matrix.

After the model training, the metrics that are calculated include the frames per second (FPS) and memory usage. The FPS is a measure of the execution speed of the tracking algorithm, while the memory usage evaluates the convenience of the model deployment. The introduction and calculation methodologies for these metrics are provided in the Supplementary Material.

Additionally, a confusion matrix is created to evaluate the performance of the model on the validation set. A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model on a set of data for which the true values are known. It allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm and can help to identify any potential issues with the model.

It's also important to note that, although not specified as a postprocessing step, the model complexity is calculated during the training process. The model complexity is linked to the required disk space and is represented by a histogram in Figure 3(a) of the provided context.

In summary, the postprocessing steps after the model training include the calculation of metrics such as FPS and memory usage, and the creation of a confusion matrix. Additionally, the model complexity is calculated during the training process. However, there is no mention of saliency maps in the provided context.
