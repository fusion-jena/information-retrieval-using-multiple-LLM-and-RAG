The criteria used to determine when training is complete in the DeepLabV3+ model, as described in the provided context, is not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred that the training process likely continues until a predetermined number of steps have been reached.

In the table of training parameters, the "Training number of steps" is listed as "â‰¥100,000". This suggests that the model is set to train for at least 100,000 steps, but it's not clear if there are additional conditions for stopping the training.

In many deep learning models, training is often stopped when the validation loss plateaus or starts to increase, indicating that the model is no longer improving its performance on unseen data. However, this specific criterion is not mentioned in the provided context.

It's also worth noting that the training parameters provided are for a specific use case of the DeepLabV3+ model, as applied to remote sensing data in the study described in the paper. Different criteria may be used in other applications or implementations of the model.

Therefore, while it can be inferred that the DeepLabV3+ model is set to train for a minimum of 100,000 steps, the exact criteria for determining when training is complete are not specified in the given context.
