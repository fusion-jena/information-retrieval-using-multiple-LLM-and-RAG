Based on the provided context, it appears that there is no explicit mention of the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, there are some details about the preprocessing and training data that can be used to infer potential bias mitigation strategies.

Firstly, the dataset was split into training and test sets, with 80% of each dialect class used for training and 20% for testing. This is an example of stratified sampling, where the splits are made in such a way that the distribution of labels remains similar in both sets. Stratified sampling can help reduce bias by ensuring that each subset (training and testing) contains a representative sample of all dialect classes.

Secondly, the training set consisted of 80% of songs from each dialect class, while the test set included all Foreign Out-of-distribution Unseen (FOFU) and Local Out-of-distribution Unseen (LODU) songs, along with 20% of other dialect classes. This approach allowed the model to be exposed to a diverse range of dialects during training, which could potentially help reduce bias towards specific dialects.

Lastly, the context states that "no additional preprocessing was applied to the spectrograms" and that the power of human-machine teaming was demonstrated. This implies that the dataset was not manipulated to favor any particular dialect class or to oversample/undersample any specific dialects.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, it can be inferred that stratified sampling and diverse data collection were employed. However, without further information, it is difficult to definitively state if other bias mitigation strategies, such as oversampling, undersampling, or applying specific data augmentation techniques, were used.
