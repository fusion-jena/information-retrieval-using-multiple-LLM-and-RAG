The provided context discusses the training of Vision Transformer (ViT) models for birdsong classification, but it does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps applied to the data before training the models. However, it can be inferred that some preprocessing steps were taken into account.

Firstly, the authors used ImageNet-based weights for pretraining the ViT models, which suggests that the input data was preprocessed to be compatible with the ImageNet dataset. Common preprocessing steps for ImageNet include resizing the images to 256x256 pixels, randomly cropping them to 224x224 pixels, and applying horizontal flipping for data augmentation (Deng et al., 2009).

Secondly, the authors used various data augmentation techniques, such as adding Gaussian noise, pink noise, primary and secondary background noise soundscapes, and mixed up random bird species. These techniques are typically applied in the frequency domain or spectrogram of the audio data. Although not explicitly stated, these methods might involve additional preprocessing steps, such as Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) or Mel-spectrogram conversion.

Thirdly, the authors used two types of background noise soundscapes from the bird audio detection data set from the DCASE challenge (Berger et al., 2018; Himawan et al., 2018; Liaqat et al., 2018). This suggests that the original bird audio data might have been preprocessed to extract background noise soundscapes.

In summary, based on the provided context, the preprocessing steps for training the ViT models for birdsong classification might include:

1. Resizing and cropping the input data to match the ImageNet dataset dimensions.
2. Applying data augmentation techniques, such as adding Gaussian noise, pink noise, primary and secondary background noise soundscapes, and mixed up random bird species.
3. Preprocessing the bird audio data to extract background noise soundscapes.

However, the context does not provide explicit details about the preprocessing steps, and further investigation would be required to confirm the exact preprocessing methods used.
