The type of deep learning model used in the described pipeline is a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), which is a type of feedforward artificial neural network (ANN). Although the term "deep learning" is often associated with models that have many layers, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), MLPs can also be considered deep learning models when they have multiple hidden layers. In this specific case, the MLP is integrated with a Markov chain (MC) model, forming the MLPnn-MC model. This model is used for robust future Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) simulation, learning complex, multivariate, and non-linear relationships to create several transitions and predict unseen data within the model.
