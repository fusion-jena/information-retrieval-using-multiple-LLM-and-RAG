Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline in this study uses raster data formats as its primary data source.

The study focuses on determining the richness and abundance of invasive alien species in a mountainous region. The data sources for this study include native and alien species pools, which are further categorized into cultivated, casual, naturalized, and invasive species.

To analyze the relationship between invasive alien species and environmental factors, the study uses various data formats. These include:

1. Soil Organic Carbon Content (Hengl and Wheeler, 2018) from OpenLandMap, which is available at six depths and has a spatial resolution of 250 m. These variables are then aggregated to a spatial resolution of 1 km2 in the Google Earth Engine.
2. Topographic variables such as slope, aspect, and elevation are extracted from GTOPO with a spatial resolution of 1 km2.

These data formats are used to determine the relationship between invasive alien species and environmental factors. However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of image, audio, video, or CSV data formats in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline in this study primarily uses raster data formats.
