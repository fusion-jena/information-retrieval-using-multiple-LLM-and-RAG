The provided context discusses the use of deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), in voice feature extraction and classification. However, it does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I will provide a general overview of some common techniques used to address data bias, which include Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and Diverse data collection.



In a deep learning pipeline, data preprocessing plays a crucial role in addressing data bias. Data bias can occur due to various reasons, such as unequal representation, measurement errors, or confounding factors. Here are some common techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing:

1. Stratified splitting: When splitting the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets, it is essential to ensure that each set retains the original data distribution's characteristics. Stratified sampling is a method that ensures each subset has a similar distribution of classes as the original dataset. This technique helps maintain balance and avoid bias in the data distribution across the subsets.

2. Oversampling: In cases where one class is underrepresented compared to others, oversampling can be used to balance the dataset. Oversampling involves creating additional instances of the minority class, either by replicating existing instances or generating synthetic samples using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). By increasing the number of instances in the minority class, the deep learning model is less likely to be biased towards the majority class.

3. Undersampling: Alternatively, when the majority class is overrepresented, undersampling can be used to balance the dataset. Undersampling involves reducing the number of instances in the majority class, either by randomly selecting a subset or using more advanced techniques like Tomek links. However, undersampling may lead to loss of information, so it should be used carefully.

4. Diverse data collection: Addressing data bias starts with collecting diverse and representative data. Ensuring that the dataset includes a wide variety of samples, free from measurement errors and confounding factors, can help minimize data bias. Collecting data from multiple sources, varying conditions, and diverse demographics can contribute to a more balanced and unbiased dataset.

In the context of voice feature extraction and classification using CNNs, these techniques can be applied during the preprocessing phase to ensure a fair and unbiased dataset. By addressing data bias during preprocessing, the deep learning model can provide more accurate and reliable results.
