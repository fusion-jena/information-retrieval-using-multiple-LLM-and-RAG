Based on the provided context, the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model (Multilayer Perceptron) are not explicitly mentioned. However, there are some details about the model's architecture. The Multilayer Perceptron model consists of three layers: an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The input layer has 21 nodes, corresponding to the 21 environmental variables used in the study. The output layer has 4 nodes, representing the four tropical tuna species (Silky shark, Yellowfin tuna, Bigeye tuna, and Skipjack tuna). The number of nodes in the hidden layer is not specified.

As for the learning rate and optimizer, the context does not provide enough information to give a precise answer. However, it is mentioned that the model's performance is compared to other machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SMO), Na√Øve Bayes, and Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SKJ). These algorithms have different default settings for learning rate and optimizer. For instance, the default learning rate for Stochastic Gradient Boosting in the Weka machine learning library (used in the study) is 0.1, and it uses the gradient descent optimizer.

In summary, the provided context does not contain explicit information about the learning rate and optimizer used in the Multilayer Perceptron model. The model's architecture includes an input layer with 21 nodes, a hidden layer with an unspecified number of nodes, and an output layer with 4 nodes. The learning rate and optimizer might be similar to other machine learning algorithms used in the study, but this is only an assumption.
