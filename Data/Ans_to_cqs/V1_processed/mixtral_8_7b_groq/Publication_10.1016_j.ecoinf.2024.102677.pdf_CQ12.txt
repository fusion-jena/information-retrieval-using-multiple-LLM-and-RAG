The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident in the context provided, where it is mentioned that several state-of-the-art CNN architectures, including VGG, Inception, and ResNet, were fine-tuned and evaluated for image classification. Furthermore, the ResNet architecture, a variant of CNN, is reported to have outperformed the other models. Therefore, it can be concluded that a CNN model was used in the pipeline for landscape type classification.
