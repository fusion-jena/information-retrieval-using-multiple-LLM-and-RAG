Based on the provided context, there is no information indicating that a specific deep learning model, such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer, is used in the pipeline. The context mainly discusses the comparison between the Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) model and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for predicting the Ecological Footprint (EF).

The BPNN model is a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that has been widely used for various applications, such as carbon emissions and water issues. However, it has some limitations, such as a slow convergence rate and a tendency to reach a local minimum. The SVM model, on the other hand, has a complete theoretical framework and has been primarily used for regression analysis.

In the study mentioned in the context, the researchers conducted a comparison between the BPNN and SVM models to seek a more suitable prediction model for the EF by taking advantage of both models. Therefore, based on the provided context, the deep learning model used in the pipeline is the Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN), which is a traditional neural network model and not a deep learning model with multiple hidden layers.
