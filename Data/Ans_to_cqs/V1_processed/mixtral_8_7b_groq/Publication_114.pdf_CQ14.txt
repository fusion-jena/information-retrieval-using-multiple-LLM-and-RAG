The provided context does not give specific information on how the hyperparameters of the models were optimized. There is no mention of techniques such as grid search, random search, or any other optimization methods.

The context does provide a table (Table 2) comparing the performance of three deep learning models (VGG16, ResNet50, and AlexNet) in classifying tree species. The metrics used to evaluate the models' performance include user's accuracy (UA), producer's accuracy (PA), and F1-Score for both user's and producer's accuracy. However, the process of hyperparameter tuning for these models is not discussed.

Additionally, the context includes information on the field-surveyed and predicted tree species richness, diversity index comparisons, and diversity maps. While these are important aspects of the study, they do not provide insight into the hyperparameter optimization process.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to answer the query regarding the optimization of the model's hyperparameters.
