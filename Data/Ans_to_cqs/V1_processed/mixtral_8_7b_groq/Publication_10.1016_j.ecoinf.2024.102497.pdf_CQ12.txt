The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of any deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or Transformers in the pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of machine learning techniques for bathymetry retrieval, specifically focusing on CART (Classification and Regression Tree) and Random Forest Regression (RFR) methods.

The CART method is a type of decision tree algorithm that involves feature selection, tree generation, and pruning. It builds a tree model by recursively splitting the data into subsets based on selected features and thresholds that minimize the variance of the target variable within each subset. The RFR method, on the other hand, is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple decision trees to improve the accuracy and stability of the model.

The context also mentions the use of the Python programming language and the 'sklearn' library to implement the CART model. Specific model parameters were fine-tuned to optimize the regression decision tree for efficiency and suitability.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the deep learning models such as CNNs, RNNs, or Transformers are not used in the pipeline. Instead, the focus is on machine learning techniques, specifically CART and RFR methods, for bathymetry retrieval.
