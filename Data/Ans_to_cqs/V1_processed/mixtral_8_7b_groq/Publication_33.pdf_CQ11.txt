The provided context does not include information about a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It mentions that the study applied the proposed framework to a study case of identifying 20 fish species from 13,232 underwater images on coral reefs, but it does not provide a link to the data repository where the pipeline or the dataset is located. The context includes several citations to scientific papers and preprints, but none of them contain or refer to the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
