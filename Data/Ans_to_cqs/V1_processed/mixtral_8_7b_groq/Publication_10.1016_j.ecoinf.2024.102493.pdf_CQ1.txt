The text provided does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of several datasets and data sources that were utilized in a study related to ecological informatics.

The first source of data mentioned is the MOD13A2 dataset from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. This dataset was used to acquire NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data, which has a spatial resolution of 1 km and a temporal resolution of 16 days. The dataset was collected over the period from January 2001 to December 2020, resulting in a total of 460 images (23 images per year). The preprocessing of this dataset included proportional scaling, projection transformations, and mask extraction based on watershed boundaries.

The second set of data mentioned in the text is related to 12 drivers that were selected for the study, which are categorized into climate, terrain, and human activity. These drivers include climate factors such as temperature, precipitation, and sunshine duration; terrain factors such as elevation, slope, aspect, geomorphological type, and nighttime light; and human activity factors such as population density, road distance, and land use/land cover. However, the text does not provide information on how these data were collected or what methods were used for measuring these factors.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the study utilized remote sensing data from the MOD13A2 dataset and other data sources related to climate, terrain, and human activity. However, the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned.
