The deep learning pipeline can be used with various data formats, including image, audio, video, and CSV files. However, the specific context provided does not mention the data formats used. Instead, it focuses on the use of deep learning models for supervised classification of time series data.

In this context, time series data is likely stored in a CSV format, with each row representing a time point and each column representing a feature. The deep learning models are then trained on this data to classify the time series into different categories.

The models used in the pipeline include ResNet, InceptionTime, LSTM, and CNN, which are commonly used for image, audio, and video data. However, these models can also be adapted for time series data by modifying their architecture.

For example, ResNet is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that was originally designed for image classification tasks. However, it can be modified for time series data by replacing the 2D convolutional layers with 1D convolutional layers, which operate on sequences of data rather than images.

Similarly, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that was originally designed for sequential data such as text and speech. It can be used for time series data by treating the time series as a sequence of data points.

InceptionTime is a deep learning architecture specifically designed for time series data. It is based on the Inception architecture, which was originally designed for image classification tasks. InceptionTime modifies the Inception architecture to operate on time series data by replacing the convolutional layers with causal convolutional layers, which only consider past data points.

Overall, while the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are not mentioned in the provided context, it is clear that the pipeline can be used with various data formats, including time series data stored in a CSV format. The models used in the pipeline can be adapted for time series data by modifying their architecture.
