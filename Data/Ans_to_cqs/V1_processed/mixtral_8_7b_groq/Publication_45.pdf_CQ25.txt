The purpose of the deep learning model in this particular study is for ecological prediction. More specifically, it is used to predict bark beetle outbreaks in conifer forests. The deep learning model used here is a deep neural network (DNN), which is a type of artificial neural network consisting of multiple layers and a large number of neurons.

Deep learning models, such as DNNs, have gained popularity in recent years due to their ability to train larger and deeper neural networks, thanks to the development of improved algorithms for optimizing connection weights and the increase in available computing power and training data. These high-capacity networks have been found to outperform simpler ANN ancestors and often perform better than other ML approaches in standardized tests of prediction accuracy.

In this study, the DNN is used to predict bark beetle outbreaks by analyzing ecological data. The researchers repeated experiments using other widely used classification algorithms, such as distributed random forest, gradient boosting machine, and generalized linear model, to compare the performance of the DNN to these other methods. The H2O platform was used to provide a set of fast and scalable learning algorithms and integrate them within the R software and environment.

Overall, the purpose of the deep learning model in this study is to improve ecological prediction by analyzing ecological data and predicting bark beetle outbreaks in conifer forests. The use of a DNN allows for a high-capacity network that can outperform other ML approaches, providing a more accurate prediction of bark beetle outbreaks.
