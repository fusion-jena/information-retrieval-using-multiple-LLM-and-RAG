The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model's performance was evaluated using a validation dataset, which was separate from the training dataset. This is suggested by the mention of "training data and validation distribution data" in the context.

Additionally, the use of the Random Forest (RF) classification algorithm implies that the model's performance was likely evaluated using out-of-bag (OOB) error estimation, which is a built-in feature of RF. OOB error estimation provides an unbiased estimate of the model's generalization error by averaging the prediction errors for each sample when it is not used in the construction of the RF model.

Furthermore, the context mentions that the training dataset was divided into four classes based on the species present, and the response variable was the training dataset divided into these four classes. This suggests that the model's performance was evaluated based on its ability to accurately classify the four classes.

Overall, while the specific strategy for monitoring the model's performance during training is not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that a combination of validation dataset evaluation and OOB error estimation was used, along with classification accuracy metrics.
