Based on the provided context, specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline are not given. However, we can make some educated guesses based on the context.

The context discusses various numerical values and ranges, as well as references to human impact measures, vegetation, and the FWI and FFMC data layers. These references suggest that the data being used is likely related to environmental science or a similar field.

In environmental science, there are several common methods for collecting raw data. These methods include:

1. Surveys: Surveys can be used to collect data from human respondents about their perceptions, attitudes, or behaviors related to the environment. Surveys can be conducted in person, over the phone, or online.
2. Sensors: Sensors can be used to collect data about environmental conditions, such as temperature, humidity, or air quality. Sensors can be placed in fixed locations or mounted on mobile platforms, such as drones or satellites.
3. Public datasets: Public datasets, such as those maintained by government agencies or research institutions, can be used to collect data for deep learning models. These datasets may include information about environmental conditions, species distributions, or human activities.

Based on the context provided, it is likely that a combination of these methods was used to collect the raw data for the deep learning pipeline. For example, sensors may have been used to collect data about environmental conditions, while surveys may have been used to collect data about human impact on the environment. Public datasets may have also been used to supplement the collected data.

However, without more specific information about the data and the deep learning pipeline, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer to this query.
