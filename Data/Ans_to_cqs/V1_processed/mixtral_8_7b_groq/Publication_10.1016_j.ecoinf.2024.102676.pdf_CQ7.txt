Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context mainly focuses on the methods used for analyzing animal tracks and does not mention any details about the data splitting process for deep learning model training.

However, the paper by Garcia-Laencina et al. (2010) provides some insights into pattern classification with missing data, which could be relevant for the data preparation process before splitting the data into training, testing, and validation sets. The authors discuss various methods for handling missing data, such as omitting missing values and mean imputation.

In the context provided, the "Delete Case" and "Mean imputation" methods were used to handle missing data. The "Delete Case" method involves removing all data rows containing missing values, while the "Mean imputation" method replaces missing values with the mean value of the respective feature.

Additionally, the paper by Hasler et al. (2004) presents a footprint recognition method for rodents and insects, which could involve some form of data splitting for model training and evaluation. However, the context does not provide specific details about the data splitting criteria used in this study.

In summary, while the provided context offers some insights into data preprocessing methods, it does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation).
