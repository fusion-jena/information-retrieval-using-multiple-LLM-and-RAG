Based on the provided context, there is no clear information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The text mentions that the paper "Deep Learning for Large Scale Biodiversity Monitoring" was uploaded by Bernie Tershy on 29 September 2015, but it does not specify the repository where the data can be found.

Moreover, the paper describes the use of big data infrastructure and deep learning techniques for biodiversity monitoring, but it does not provide information about the data sources or the data repository. The authors mention that they have a large amount of labeled data produced by analysts using their UI, but they do not specify where this data is stored or how it can be accessed.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine the location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. If the data repository is available in a public repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF, it would be helpful to include this information in the paper or in the associated materials. This would enable other researchers to access and use the data, promoting transparency and reproducibility in the field of biodiversity monitoring.
