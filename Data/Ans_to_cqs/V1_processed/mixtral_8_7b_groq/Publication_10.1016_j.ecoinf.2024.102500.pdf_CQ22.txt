The provided context does not include information about the evaluation metrics used for deep learning models. However, it does provide details about the metrics used to evaluate various machine learning models for dissolved oxygen (DO) prediction.

In the context, the authors used the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean bias error (MBE), mean absolute error (MAE), and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) as statistical markers to evaluate the performance of models for DO prediction. The R2 score measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s). A higher R2 score indicates a better fit of the model to the data. The RMSE measures the difference between predicted and actual values, with a lower value indicating better performance. MBE measures the average magnitude and direction of the prediction error, while MAE measures the average magnitude of the prediction error without considering direction. NSE compares the residual variance with the data variance, providing a measure of how well the model predictions fit the data.

The context also mentions that the models were evaluated using fivefold cross-validation, where the dataset was split into five equal-sized folds, and the training and assessment process was validated five times, each time using a different fold for testing. Averaging the performance metrics across the five iterations improved the model performance and hyperparameter tuning efficiency estimation.

However, the context does not mention any deep learning models, so it is not possible to provide an answer to the query based on the given information. Deep learning models have different evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, which are used depending on the specific problem and the nature of the data.
