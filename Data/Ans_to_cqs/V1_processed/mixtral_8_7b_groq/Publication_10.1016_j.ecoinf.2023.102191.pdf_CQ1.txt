In the study described, the method utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline involves the use of a mobile app to conduct post-dive interviews with recreational SCUBA divers. The app includes a custom species list, and divers are asked to report the frequency and abundance of specific marine taxa that have been selected by local experts based on their conservation status, commercial interest, ecological function, and non-indigenous origin. The app also collects metadata on location, number of dives, and number of divers, which enables normalization based on sampling effort.

This method of data collection combines elements of standardization with the simplicity and accessibility of opportunistic reporting. By focusing on the frequency and abundance of specific taxa and collecting metadata on sampling effort, the method aims to provide higher data quality than opportunistic reporting while still allowing for the participation of recreational SCUBA divers.

It is important to note that this method does not require the submission of photographic evidence, which could be validated by experts or using machine learning. However, the study addresses this potential issue by relying on the knowledge and experience of dive guides to validate the species sighted and reported.

Overall, the method described in the study involves the use of a mobile app to collect data on the frequency and abundance of specific marine taxa from recreational SCUBA divers, while also collecting metadata on sampling effort. This method combines elements of standardization with the simplicity and accessibility of opportunistic reporting, and relies on the knowledge and experience of dive guides to validate the species reported.
