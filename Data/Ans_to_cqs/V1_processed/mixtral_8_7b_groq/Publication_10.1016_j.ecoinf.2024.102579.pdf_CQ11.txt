The provided context does not contain information about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link related to it. The context is about a study that uses relascope sampling and different estimators to calculate the diversity indices of trees in a forest. The study compares the performance of the inventory estimator, NN1, NN2, NN3, and NN4 estimators in estimating tree diversity. The data used in the study may be available in a repository, but the context does not provide a link to it. Therefore, I cannot provide the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline as it is not mentioned in the given context.
