The code repository link for the deep learning pipeline proposed in the study "Hierarchical-taxonomy-aware and attentional convolutional neural networks for acoustic identification of bird species: A phylogenetic perspective" is available on GitHub. You can access the code and comprehensive data sets at <https://github.com/WanderQY/Hierarchical-taxonomy-aware-model>. The repository is fully documented with ISO-compliant metadata, making it easy for users to understand and utilize the code.

The study presents the Phylogenetic Perspective Neural Network (PPNN), a deep learning model that incorporates hierarchical multilevel labels for bird species to better capture feature information and improve classification accuracy. The model consists of three main modules: the backbone feature extraction module, the hierarchical feature interaction module, and the classification module. The hierarchical feature interaction module uses hierarchical attention (HA) and cross-hierarchy orthogonal fusion (CHOF) mechanisms to extract and select common and distinguishing features.

The authors have also provided a path correction strategy to rectify inconsistent predictions, which further enhances the model's performance. The experimental results demonstrate that the PPNN outperforms current methods in bird acoustic recognition.

In summary, if you are interested in implementing or building upon the deep learning pipeline proposed in the study, you can find the code and data sets in the provided GitHub repository. The repository also includes metadata and documentation to help you understand and use the code effectively.
