Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, there are some related discussions on the use of specific techniques and methods in the context of ecological studies and population genetics that can provide some insights.

In the study by Diaz-Papkovich et al. (2021), they used the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) algorithm for dimensionality reduction and visualization in population genetics. UMAP is a probabilistic approach that relies on stochastic optimization techniques. Although the authors did not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness, they noted that UMAP provides consistent results across multiple runs. This suggests that the algorithm may have built-in mechanisms to handle randomness during optimization.

In another study by Dorrity et al. (2020), they applied UMAP for visualizing physical and genetic interactions. They emphasized the importance of setting a random seed value to ensure reproducibility in their analysis. Specifically, they set a fixed random seed value for the UMAP algorithm and other stochastic components in their pipeline. This practice helps to reduce variability in the results and ensures that the same analysis can be repeated with the same input data.

In the context of ecological studies, the use of machine learning techniques such as support vector machines, artificial neural networks, random forests, and maximum entropy for species distribution modeling (SDM) may also involve handling randomness. For instance, the initialization of weights in neural networks or the selection of random subsets for training and validation in other methods may require setting a random seed value. However, the provided context does not contain specific information on how these strategies are employed in SDM.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly answer the query about strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it suggests that setting a random seed value can be important for ensuring reproducibility in some applications. Additionally, some techniques such as UMAP may have built-in mechanisms to handle randomness during optimization. However, further investigation is needed to provide a comprehensive answer to this query in the context of deep learning pipelines for ecological studies.
