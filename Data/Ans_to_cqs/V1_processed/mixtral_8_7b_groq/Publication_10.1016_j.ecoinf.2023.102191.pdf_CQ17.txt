The provided context does not contain information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. The text mainly discusses a study related to marine life conservation, specifically a pilot study that tested the use of an app to compile information on the frequency and abundance of 18 marine taxa.

The app includes features such as a checklist for divers to cross off species they've seen, embedding the interview process into regular dive center operations, and collecting metadata on location, number of dives, and number of divers to enable normalization based on sampling effort. The study also mentions the importance of validating species identification and mitigating reporting bias.

However, the text does not mention any specific deep learning techniques or regularization methods like dropout, L2 regularization, data augmentation, early stopping, or other strategies used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models.

Therefore, I don't have the information to answer this query based on the provided context.
