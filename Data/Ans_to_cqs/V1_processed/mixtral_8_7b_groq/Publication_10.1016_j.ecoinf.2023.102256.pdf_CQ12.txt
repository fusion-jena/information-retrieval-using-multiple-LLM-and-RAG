The type of deep learning model used in the described pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the architecture details provided for the baseline model and the subsequent modifications made to it. The baseline model consists of two convolutional layers, each followed by ReLU activation and max pooling. After these convolutional layers, a flattening operation is performed, and the model concludes with two fully-connected layers. This structure aligns with the design of CNNs, which are particularly effective in processing grid-like data, such as time-series data and images. In this case, the input is a spectrogram, which is a two-dimensional representation of audio data, making a CNN a suitable choice for this task.
