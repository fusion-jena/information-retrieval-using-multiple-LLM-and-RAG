The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for bacterial image recognition in environmental samples. However, it is mentioned that transfer learning was initiated from an already annotated daily common objects dataset (COCO) for training the Mask R-CNN model. Therefore, it can be inferred that the COCO dataset was used as one of the datasets in this deep learning pipeline. The COCO dataset is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset, which contains images of complex everyday scenes. The other datasets used in this pipeline are not specified in the context. It is also important to note that the images used in this study were acquired from soil samples taken from three contrasting locations: Greenland, Sweden, and Kenya. These images were used for training and validating the deep learning model for quantitative analysis of soil bacterial communities.
