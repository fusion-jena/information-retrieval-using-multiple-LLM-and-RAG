Based on the provided context, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images. The large-scale image datasets, after augmentation, resulted in 185,431 images with 38 classes. The image dataset is used to obtain the pretraining weights for the proposed BEiT model. However, the context does not mention any other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV. Therefore, based on the given information, the deep learning pipeline uses image data format.
