The provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for SPAD value prediction. However, it is mentioned that an artificial neural network (ANN) was implemented for SPAD value modelling. ANN construction involved numerical optimization of the model, which typically involves optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. Therefore, it can be inferred that optimization techniques like SGD or Adam were likely used in the deep learning pipeline for SPAD value prediction.

The context also mentions that the ANN was constructed empirically, with the first layer containing two input nodes and the last layer containing only one node for predicted SPAD value. The model residuals obtained in each of the 100 successful runs were analyzed for a more reliable evaluation of the model performance. This suggests that the ANN model was trained and validated using standard deep learning practices, which would have involved optimization techniques.

In summary, while the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for SPAD value prediction are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, it can be inferred that optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam were likely used based on the description of the ANN implementation and deep learning practices followed.
