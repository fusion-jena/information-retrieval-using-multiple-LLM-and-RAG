The provided context focuses on model architectures and training procedures, and it does not explicitly mention any postprocessing steps. However, based on common practices in machine learning and computer vision, we can infer some possible postprocessing steps that might be involved after the model training.

Firstly, once the model training is complete, one typical postprocessing step is to evaluate the model's performance using various metrics. In the given Table 2, several metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score have been calculated for different basic models and proposed methods on the IP102 dataset. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to classify images correctly.

Secondly, another common postprocessing step is to generate a confusion matrix. A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model. It allows visualization of the types of errors made by the classifier, such as false positives and false negatives. However, the provided context does not mention the calculation of a confusion matrix.

Lastly, saliency maps can be used as a postprocessing step to visualize the regions of an input image that are most important for the model's prediction. Saliency maps can help in interpreting the model's decision-making process and understanding which parts of the image the model is focusing on. However, the provided context does not mention the use of saliency maps.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention any postprocessing steps, it is common practice to calculate various metrics, generate confusion matrices, and use saliency maps to gain insights into the model's performance and decision-making process after training.
