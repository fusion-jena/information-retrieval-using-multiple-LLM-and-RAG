Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention some details about the evaluation metrics used during the model selection process.

For the RI models, a grid search was performed to find the hyperparameters with the highest level of accuracy, and the number of iterations required until convergence was determined using early stopping. Similarly, for the RY models, the number of iterations was kept at 500. The tuned hyperparameters of the final models are presented in Table 2, which includes the number of iterations, learning rate, and tree depth.

In addition, the top four most influential variables from the GBRT models were included in a series of generalised additive models (GAM). However, these steps seem to be part of the model training process rather than postprocessing.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to provide a specific answer regarding the postprocessing steps involved after the model training.
