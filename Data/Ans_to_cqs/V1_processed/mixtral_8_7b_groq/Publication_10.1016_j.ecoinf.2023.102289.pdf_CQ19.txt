The deep learning model in this study is built using the MXNet framework, which offers a comprehensive suite of neural network models and functionalities for AI development. This is evident in section A.1.1, where it is stated that LaDeco runs on MXNet's framework, chosen for its wide variety of semantic segmentation (SS) models that meet diverse research requirements. Furthermore, in section 2.3, it is mentioned that MXNet serves as the central computational module and was used in conjunction with GluonCV to develop LaDeco. However, it is important to note that other frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch could have been used for different studies, but in this specific case, MXNet was the chosen platform.
