In the context provided, the primary example of raw data collection is through the use of camera traps in ecological studies. Camera traps are remotely triggered cameras that capture images of wildlife, resulting in a large volume of data in the form of images. This method is used for non-invasive surveying of wildlife and has led to an enormous volume of raw data that needs to be reviewed and analyzed.

However, the text does not explicitly mention other methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. It can be inferred that other methods such as surveys, sensors, and public datasets are also used for collecting raw data, as these are common sources of data in many fields.

Surveys can be used to collect data through questionnaires, interviews, or observations. Sensors can be used to collect data through various types of measurements, such as temperature, pressure, or motion. Public datasets are often available in many fields, such as healthcare, finance, or social media, and can be used as a source of raw data for deep learning.

In summary, while the text primarily focuses on the use of camera traps for collecting raw data in the context of ecological studies, other methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline include surveys, sensors, and public datasets.
