Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning models. However, we can infer some steps that might have been taken based on common practices in the field of machine learning and deep learning.



After training the deep learning models for site data, coral cover, and connectivity, the models would need to be deployed in a suitable environment for use in a decision support tool. While the context does not provide specific details about the deployment process, we can make some educated guesses based on standard practices.

Firstly, the trained models would likely need to be serialized, which involves saving the model's architecture, weights, and other relevant information to a file. This allows the model to be easily loaded and used in a different environment without requiring the original training code and data.

Next, a platform would need to be selected for deploying the models. This could involve using a cloud-based platform, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or deploying the models on-premises, depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the project.

Once the platform is selected, the serialized models would be loaded onto the platform and integrated into the decision support tool. This might involve using a web-based interface, a desktop application, or a mobile app, depending on the intended use case.

Finally, the deployed models would need to be monitored and maintained to ensure they continue to perform accurately and efficiently. This might involve tracking metrics such as accuracy, runtime, and memory usage, and periodically retraining the models with new data to maintain their performance.

Overall, while the context does not provide specific details about the deployment process for the deep learning models, we can infer that the models would likely have been serialized, deployed on a suitable platform, integrated into a decision support tool, and monitored and maintained over time.
