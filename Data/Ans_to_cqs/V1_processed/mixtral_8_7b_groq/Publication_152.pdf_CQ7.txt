The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as train, test, and validation sets, are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the results were measured, which implies the existence of a test set to evaluate the performance of the model. Additionally, the use of epochs and custom loss functions suggest the presence of a validation set to tune the model's hyperparameters during the training phase.

In the study "Learning image features with fewer labels using a semi-supervised deep convolutional network," the authors might have used a data splitting strategy to ensure the model's generalization. Commonly, data is split into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to optimize the model's parameters, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the test set is used to evaluate the final model's performance.

In the context of the paper "The Euclidean Distance Transform in Arbitrary Dimensions," the data splitting criteria are not relevant, as this paper focuses on a mathematical transform used for image processing.

In the specific project mentioned in the context, the data gathering process involves collecting images of the Hedychium Coronarium species using a DJI Phantom 2 drone. After gathering the images, they are pre-processed, and the U-Net model is trained for classification. Although the data splitting criteria are not explicitly stated, it is assumed that a suitable data splitting strategy was applied to ensure the model's generalization and performance evaluation.
