The provided context does not contain information specific to addressing data bias during the preprocessing of deep learning pipelines. However, in the context of data preprocessing for machine learning in general, several techniques are commonly used to address data bias, including:

1. Stratified sampling: This technique involves dividing the data into homogeneous subgroups (strata) and then randomly selecting a fixed number of samples from each stratum. Stratified sampling ensures that the distribution of samples across different subgroups is representative of the original dataset.

2. Oversampling: In cases where certain classes are underrepresented in the dataset, oversampling can be used to increase the number of samples from these classes. This can be done by randomly duplicating samples from the underrepresented classes or by using techniques like Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to generate synthetic samples.

3. Undersampling: Conversely, if certain classes are overrepresented in the dataset, undersampling can be used to reduce the number of samples from these classes. This can be done by randomly selecting a subset of samples from the overrepresented classes or by using techniques like NearMiss to select a subset of samples that are close to the decision boundary.

4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from a variety of sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population of interest. This can help to reduce bias by ensuring that the data reflects the diversity of the population.

In the context of deep learning, these techniques can be applied during the data preprocessing stage to ensure that the training data is representative of the population of interest and that any bias in the data is minimized. However, the provided context does not contain specific information on how these techniques are used in the context of deep learning.
