Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, such as through methods like grid search or random search. The text describes the process of fine-tuning the base model with Gulf of Mexico data, but it does not mention any specific techniques for hyperparameter optimization.

However, it does provide some details about the fine-tuning process, which could be considered as a part of the hyperparameter optimization. During fine-tuning, the feature extractor remains frozen, and the models are trained with the same parameters as the base model. A cyclical learning rate of 0.0004 is used, and the models are set to run for 50 epochs with early stopping if the validation loss does not improve within 10 epochs. A dropout rate of 0.2 is used during fine-tuning, and DropConnect is employed.

Additionally, the context explains that the random pooling used to curate each training set allows for the possibility that scarce or novel signals are not included, resulting in a large degree of error between model runs with small batch sizes. This implies that the data preprocessing and curation techniques could be considered as a part of the hyperparameter optimization process.

In summary, while the text does not explicitly mention any hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search, it does provide details about the fine-tuning process and data preprocessing techniques that could be considered as a part of the hyperparameter optimization.
