Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used for semantic segmentation of herbarium specimens. The context focuses on the methodology and techniques used for developing the deep learning model, such as the DeepLabv3+ architecture, ResNet-101 feature extractor, and data augmentation techniques. However, it does not mention any data repository or sharing platform where the pipeline or dataset is available. If you need access to the dataset or pipeline, I would recommend contacting the authors of the study for further information.
