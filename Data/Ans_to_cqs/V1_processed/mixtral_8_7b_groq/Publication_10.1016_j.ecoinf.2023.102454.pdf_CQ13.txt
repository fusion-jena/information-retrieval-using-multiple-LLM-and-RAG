I'm sorry for any confusion, but the provided context does not include information about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model. The context focuses on the study area of Xi'an, data sources, and the construction of provincial-scale fitting models for ecological informatics. It does not delve into the specifics of a deep learning model's hyperparameters.
