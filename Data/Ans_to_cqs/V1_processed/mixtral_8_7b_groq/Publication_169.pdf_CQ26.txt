The provided context discusses various aspects of deep learning models applied to document recognition, plant species recognition, and image classification, but it does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. However, it does mention a technique used to address overfitting due to a limited dataset size, which is data augmentation.

Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the diversity of the training dataset by applying random (but realistic) transformations to the existing data. For example, in the context of image classification, data augmentation can include rotating, flipping, zooming, or cropping the images. This technique helps the model generalize better and reduces overfitting.

While data augmentation does not directly address data bias, it can help indirectly by increasing the diversity of the training data. For instance, if certain classes are underrepresented in the dataset, data augmentation can help balance the class distribution.

Other techniques to address data bias during preprocessing include:

1. Stratified splitting: When splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test sets, it is essential to ensure that each set has a similar distribution of classes. Stratified splitting ensures that each subset has the same percentage of samples for each class as the original dataset.
2. Oversampling: If some classes are underrepresented in the dataset, oversampling can help balance the class distribution by replicating samples from the underrepresented classes.
3. Undersampling: If some classes have too many samples, undersampling can help balance the class distribution by removing samples from the overrepresented classes.
4. Diverse data collection: Collecting a diverse dataset with equal representation from different demographics, regions, or conditions can help reduce data bias.

In summary, the provided context discusses data augmentation as a technique to address overfitting in a limited dataset. However, it does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. Other techniques to address data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.
