Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the postprocessing steps involved after the training of the model in question. The context focuses on model pre-validation, specifically in the context of moisture, quality & natural resource management, tuberculosis epidemiology, and permafrost degradation.

However, in general, postprocessing steps after model training can include:

1. Saliency maps: These are used to visualize the importance of input features in the prediction made by the model. Saliency maps highlight the parts of the input data that the model considers most relevant for its decision.

2. Metrics calculation: After model training, it is essential to evaluate the model's performance using various metrics. These metrics can include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the curve (AUC), among others. These metrics help assess the model's overall performance and identify any potential issues.

3. Confusion matrix: A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification model. It compares the actual values with the predicted values and provides information on true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

4. Model interpretation: This step involves understanding how the model arrived at its predictions. Techniques such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) can be used to interpret the model's predictions.

5. Model deployment: Once the model has been trained and evaluated, it can be deployed in a production environment. This step involves integrating the model into a larger system or workflow.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not mention any specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, general postprocessing steps can include saliency maps, metrics calculation, confusion matrix, model interpretation, and model deployment.
