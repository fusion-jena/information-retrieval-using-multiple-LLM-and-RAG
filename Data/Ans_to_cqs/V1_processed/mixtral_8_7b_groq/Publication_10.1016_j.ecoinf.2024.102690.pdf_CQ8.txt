The provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in this research. The text focuses on the methodology and results of a study on ecological corridors and their classification, using the Platalea minor waterbird species as a reference, and does not mention any code repositories or their locations. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
