The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the context is image classification. This is evident from the discussion of training deep learning models on a small-size dataset for image recognition tasks. Moreover, the reference to the CNN architecture known as AlexNet, which was proposed for image classification in the 2012 ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge, further supports this conclusion. AlexNet is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that consists of eight layers, including five convolutional layers and three fully connected layers, designed specifically for image classification tasks.

The training of the deep learning models was carried out using stochastic gradient descent and the backpropagation algorithm included in Caffe, with the learning rate policy set to “step”. The learning rate was initially set to 10-2 for all layers, including the newly defined last fully connected layer. These details further confirm that the deep learning models in question are used for image classification tasks.

In summary, based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning models is image classification.
