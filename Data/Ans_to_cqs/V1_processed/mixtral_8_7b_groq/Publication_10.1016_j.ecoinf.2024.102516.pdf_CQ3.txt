Based on the provided context, the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline involve extracting plant cover information without training on actual annotated plant cover data. This suggests an unsupervised or weakly supervised learning approach, where the model learns to estimate plant cover information from the data itself, without explicit annotations.

The context does not mention any specific annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does mention that the network is trained on images of resolution 1536 Ã— 768 pixels, and data augmentation is performed using horizontal flipping. These techniques are commonly used to increase the diversity of the training data and improve the generalization of the model.

Furthermore, the context provides a comparison with a baseline model based on a ResNet50 architecture pre-trained on the ImageNet classification dataset. This model is then fine-tuned on the dedicated plant cover dataset. In this case, the annotations are likely to be at the image level, where each image is labeled with the corresponding plant cover information.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention any specific data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, it suggests an unsupervised or weakly supervised learning approach for estimating plant cover information. Additionally, it mentions the use of image-level annotations for fine-tuning a pre-trained model on the dedicated plant cover dataset.
