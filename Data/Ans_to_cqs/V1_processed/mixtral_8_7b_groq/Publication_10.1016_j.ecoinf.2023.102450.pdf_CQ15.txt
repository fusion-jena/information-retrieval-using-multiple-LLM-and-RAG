The provided context does not give specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipelines for training the models. However, it does mention the use of deep learning techniques in various studies related to animal tracking and wildlife video analysis.

In the study by Clune (2018), deep learning is used for automatically identifying, counting, and describing wild animals in camera-trap images. Similarly, Okafor et al. (2016) conducted a comparative study between deep learning and bag of visual words for wild-animal recognition. The study by Sch√ºtz et al. (2021) applied YOLOv4 for detection and motion monitoring of red foxes. Wang et al. (2021) presented a group behavior tracking of Daphnia magna based on motion estimation and appearance models using deep learning techniques. Willi et al. (2019) identified animal species in camera trap images using deep learning and citizen science.

These studies use deep learning techniques for various applications, but they do not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in their deep learning pipelines. Common optimization techniques used in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSprop, and Adam. These optimizers are used to minimize the loss function and update the model parameters during training.

Without specific information from the provided context, it is not possible to determine which optimization techniques were used in these deep learning pipelines. However, it is important to note that the choice of optimization technique can significantly impact the training process and the final model performance. Researchers and practitioners should carefully consider the optimization technique that best suits their specific problem and dataset.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipelines for animal tracking and wildlife video analysis, it is essential to consider the optimization technique when implementing deep learning models. Common optimization techniques include SGD, Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSprop, and Adam. The choice of optimization technique can significantly impact the training process and the final model performance.
