Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the use of a deep learning model in the described system. The text focuses on the description of a database schema and data platform for ecological informatics, including details about data sources, the creation of a spatial cube for multidimensional data analysis, and the implementation of the Access tier for analytical purposes.

However, it does not mention any deep learning models or their hyperparameters. Hyperparameters are configuration variables that are set before the learning process begins, which can significantly impact the performance of deep learning models. Examples of hyperparameters include learning rate, number of layers, number of units in each layer, type of optimizer, batch size, and regularization techniques.

Therefore, without further information, it is not possible to provide an answer to the query regarding the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
