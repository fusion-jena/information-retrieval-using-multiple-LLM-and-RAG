Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The context includes several sources that discuss deep learning and data processing, but none of them mention where the data for these pipelines is stored or deposited.

The sources do mention several tools and platforms used for data processing and analysis, such as AWS kinesis, Apache Kibana, Elasticsearch, GStreamer, and various machine learning frameworks like Theano, Torch, Caffe, Tensorflow, and deeplearning4j. However, these tools are focused on processing and analyzing data, not on storing or depositing data.

In addition, the context discusses the importance of high-quality data for machine learning and artificial intelligence applications, as well as the use of event-stream processing for real-time data analysis. However, it does not provide information on where the data for these applications is stored or deposited.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
