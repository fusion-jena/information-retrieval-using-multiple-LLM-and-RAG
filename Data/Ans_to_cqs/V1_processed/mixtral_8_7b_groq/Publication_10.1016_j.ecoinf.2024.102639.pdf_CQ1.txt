The provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the researchers worked with data related to zebrafish and rat movements within T-maze environments. This data was likely collected using sensors or some form of tracking system inside the T-maze.

In the study "Strategic neuronal encoding in medial prefrontal cortex of spatial working memory in the T-maze" by Yang and Mailman (2018), it is mentioned that they worked with T-maze environments, but there is no explicit information about data collection methods. Similarly, in the study "EcologicalInformatics81(2024)10263916" by Turab et al., the focus is on the analysis of zebrafish and rat behavior in T-maze environments using various classification algorithms, but the data collection methods are not discussed.

In the field of deep learning and machine learning, raw data can be collected from various sources, such as surveys, sensors, public datasets, and other sources depending on the specific problem and context. For example, in the study "Accelerating very deep convolutional networks for classification and detection" by Zhang et al. (2015), the authors used the ImageNet dataset, which is a large public dataset for image classification tasks. In the context of the provided studies, however, the data collection methods remain undisclosed.


Based on the provided context, the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for studies related to zebrafish and rat movements in T-maze environments are not explicitly mentioned. It can be inferred that sensors or tracking systems were used, but the context does not offer enough information to give a definitive answer.
