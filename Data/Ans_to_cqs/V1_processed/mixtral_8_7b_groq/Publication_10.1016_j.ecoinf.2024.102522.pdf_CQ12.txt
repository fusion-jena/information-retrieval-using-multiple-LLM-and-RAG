The provided context does not include information about the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. The tables and descriptions given focus on variable classifications, biological and geographical factors, and a classification table for a model. However, there is no mention of the specific deep learning model used, such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query based on the given context.
