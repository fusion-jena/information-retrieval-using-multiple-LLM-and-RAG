The deep learning models for tree species classification were implemented and trained using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in Cafe on a NVIDIA GTX Titan X GPU.

The text mentions that the training was conducted on a specific type of GPU, which is the NVIDIA GTX Titan X. However, it does not mention the use of any other hardware resources such as TPUs (Tensor Processing Units). Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be concluded that the deep learning models were trained using a NVIDIA GTX Titan X GPU.
