The provided context discusses hyperparameter optimization in machine learning models, specifically focusing on XGBoost and LightGBM. However, it does not directly mention deep learning models or their hyperparameters.

In general, deep learning models have various hyperparameters that need to be optimized for better performance. Some common hyperparameters include:

1. Learning rate: The step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function.
2. Optimizer: An algorithm used to update the weights and biases in the model based on the gradient of the loss function. Examples include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSprop, and Adam.
3. Number of layers and number of neurons per layer: The architecture of the deep learning model.
4. Activation functions: Functions applied to the output of each layer, such as ReLU, sigmoid, or tanh.
5. Regularization techniques and strength of regularization: Methods to prevent overfitting, such as L1, L2, or dropout regularization.

To determine the specific hyperparameters for a deep learning model, one needs to refer to the documentation or literature associated with the model or framework being used.
