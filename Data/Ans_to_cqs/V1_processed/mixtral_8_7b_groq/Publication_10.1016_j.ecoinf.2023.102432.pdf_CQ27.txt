Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. However, we can infer that the researchers used a multiple-instance learning algorithm, MTMI-SMF, to train their model for detecting invasive plant species.

The study aimed to address the challenge of training datasets being riddled with variability or errors by using MTMI-SMF, which can handle imperfect data. The algorithm groups pixels surrounding a training location that could have the invader, unlike most other machine learning algorithms that require a single pixel to represent a training location.

The researchers trained the model using multispectral airborne and satellite imagery, specifically NAIP, RapidEye, and Landsat 8, to detect the Brazilian peppertree in the Everglades National Park. They achieved a detection accuracy of over 70%.

However, the context does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as whether it was serialized and deployed as a web service, or if it was integrated into a larger system or application. Additionally, there is no information on the platform used for deployment, such as a cloud-based platform or a local server.

Therefore, while we can infer some details about the training process, the context does not provide enough information to answer the query about the deployment of the trained deep learning model.
