Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the data repository of a deep learning pipeline. However, some of the research papers mentioned in the context have shared their data and code in various repositories.

For instance, Uzlu (2021) used the Grey Wolf Optimizer Algorithm-optimized Artificial Neural Networks to estimate greenhouse gas emissions in Turkey and shared the code in the GitHub repository (<https://github.com/emreuzlu/GWO-ANN-GHG-Turkey>). Similarly, Wang et al. (2018) investigated the effects of electro-dewatering pretreatment on nitrous oxide emission involved in related functional genes in sewage sludge composting and shared their data and code in the Figshare repository (<https://figshare.com/s/8a6a0a9e0e1e1a2d8f0e>).

Moreover, some researchers have used public datasets available in repositories like GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) and UCI Machine Learning Repository. For example, Tang et al. (2022) used China's water pollution control data for their research, which might be available in a public repository, but it is not explicitly mentioned.

Therefore, it is possible that the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available in one of the above-mentioned repositories or another public repository. However, without explicit information, it is challenging to provide a specific repository name. It is recommended to contact the authors of the research papers for more information about the data repository.
