Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the Random Forest model were optimized in the study being discussed. Hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search are commonly used in machine learning to find the best set of hyperparameters for a given model. Grid search involves systematically trying out different combinations of hyperparameters, while random search involves randomly selecting hyperparameters to try within a given range.

However, the context does mention that the performance of the Random Forest model was compared to a different classification approach called MTMI-SMF. It is possible that the hyperparameters of the Random Forest model were optimized using one of these techniques as part of the development of the MTMI-SMF approach.

Additionally, the context states that the confusion matrix and accuracy metrics were calculated on a holdout set of data that was not used for training the model. This is a common practice in machine learning and can provide an estimate of the model's performance on unseen data. However, it does not provide information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized.

In summary, based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the Random Forest model were optimized. It is possible that they were optimized using grid search or random search as part of the development of the MTMI-SMF approach, but this is not stated in the context.
