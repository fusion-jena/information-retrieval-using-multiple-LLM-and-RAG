The provided context does not discuss specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that deep learning algorithms were considered in a study related to water quality prediction, but the limited number of samples was not conducive to deep learning.

Data augmentation techniques are commonly used in deep learning to increase the size of the training dataset and improve model performance by creating modified versions of the existing data. Some common data augmentation techniques for image data include flipping, rotating, and scaling. Flipping involves horizontally or vertically flipping the image, while rotating involves rotating the image by a certain angle. Scaling involves changing the size of the image.

In the context of water quality prediction, data augmentation techniques could be used to generate additional data points by modifying existing data. For example, if the dataset includes water quality measurements taken at different times of the day, data augmentation techniques could be used to generate additional data points by shifting the measurement times.

However, the provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for water quality prediction. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
