Based on the provided context, there is no specific information given about the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the BANTER automated machine learning classification. However, it is mentioned that the development of automated classification routines generally aims to improve efficiency, reduce subjectivity, and decrease the cost of analyzing large datasets. In the context of beaked whale call classification, it is recommended to include a high level of confidence for inclusion in the training data, especially for species with small study areas.

In general, machine learning models, including those used for classification, use various criteria to determine when training is complete. One common method is to monitor the validation loss, which measures the error of the model on unseen data, and stop training when the validation loss plateaus or starts to increase, indicating that the model is no longer improving its performance on new data. This is known as early stopping.

Another criterion that can be used to determine when training is complete is convergence, which occurs when the model's weights and biases no longer change significantly during training. This can be monitored using various metrics, such as the gradient of the loss function or the change in the model's performance on the training data.

In addition, cross-validation can be used to assess the performance of the model and determine when training is complete. This involves dividing the data into multiple folds, training the model on one fold while evaluating its performance on the remaining folds, and repeating this process for each fold. The performance of the model can then be averaged across all folds to obtain a more robust estimate of its generalization ability.

Overall, while the provided context does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the BANTER automated machine learning classification, there are various methods that can be used to monitor the model's performance and determine when training is complete in general. These include early stopping, convergence, and cross-validation.
