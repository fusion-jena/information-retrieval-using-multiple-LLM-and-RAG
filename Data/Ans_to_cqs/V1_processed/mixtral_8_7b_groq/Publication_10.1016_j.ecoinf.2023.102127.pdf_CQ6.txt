The provided context discusses the challenges of model evaluation in species distribution modeling (SDM), but it does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps for deep learning models. However, it is generally applicable that data preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning are crucial for the success of any machine learning model, including deep learning models.

Normalization and scaling are essential for many machine learning algorithms, including deep learning models, to converge during training and to achieve better performance. These techniques ensure that all features have similar ranges and distributions, preventing any single feature from dominating the learning process. Common normalization and scaling techniques include z-score normalization, min-max scaling, and robust scaling.

Cleaning refers to the process of removing or correcting erroneous or missing data points. Deep learning models are sensitive to noisy or missing data, and cleaning is necessary to ensure that the model learns from high-quality data. Cleaning techniques include imputation, outlier detection, and data augmentation.

In the context of SDM, curation and bias correction are also important preprocessing steps. Curating data involves selecting relevant and informative data points while accounting for biases that plague biodiversity datasets. Bias correction techniques include rarefaction, stratified sampling, and environmental surrogates.

Therefore, before training a deep learning model for SDM or any other application, it is essential to perform data preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, cleaning, curation, and bias correction. These steps ensure that the model learns from high-quality, normalized, and unbiased data, leading to better performance and more reliable predictions.
