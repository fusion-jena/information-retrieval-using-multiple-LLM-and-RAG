Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, there are some related practices mentioned that can help manage the randomness and variability inherent in machine learning and deep learning models.

In the study by Miura et al. (2023), they used a machine learning algorithm called Support Vector Machine (SVM) in combination with a technique called Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD) for sparse modeling. ARD is a Bayesian approach that helps in feature selection by determining the relevance of input features, thus reducing the impact of less relevant features and managing the model's complexity.

In the study by Noori et al. (2019), they presented a simple model for simulating reservoir stratification using a deterministic approach. While this study does not directly address deep learning or randomness, it highlights the importance of understanding and modeling physical processes in water bodies, which can help reduce uncertainty and variability in machine learning models.

In the context of machine learning and deep learning frameworks, Nguyen et al. (2019) mentioned the importance of cross-validation and ensemble methods for improving model performance and managing overfitting. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into multiple folds, training the model on different subsets, and evaluating its performance on the remaining portions. Ensemble methods, such as bagging and boosting, combine multiple models to improve overall performance and reduce the impact of individual model variability.

In the study by Miura et al. (2023), they used lagged variables to predict algal blooms, which can be seen as a way to account for temporal dependencies and reduce the impact of random fluctuations in the data.

While not explicitly mentioned, setting a random seed value is a common practice in deep learning to ensure reproducibility and manage randomness. By setting a seed value, the random initialization of weights and biases, data shuffling, and other stochastic processes become deterministic, allowing for consistent results across multiple runs.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, there are related practices mentioned, such as feature selection, physical process modeling, cross-validation, ensemble methods, and lagged variables. Additionally, setting a random seed value is a common and important practice in deep learning for ensuring reproducibility and managing randomness.
