The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific cloud platform used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) as a cloud-processing platform for image analysis and selection. GEE is a platform developed by Google that provides a large catalog of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets, enabling high-performance and rapid processing of images.

It is important to note that while GEE provides the ability to perform image analysis and selection, it may not support the deployment of deep learning models. Therefore, it is possible that the deep learning model was developed and trained using a different cloud platform, such as Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Amazon Web Services (AWS), or Microsoft Azure.

Without further information, it is not possible to determine with certainty which cloud platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. However, based on the context provided, it is clear that Google Earth Engine was used for image analysis and selection in the study.
