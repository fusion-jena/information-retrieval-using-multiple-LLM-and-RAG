Based on the provided context, there is no code repository link for the deep learning pipeline mentioned. The context consists of various research papers and a conference article, but none of them have provided a link to the code repository for a deep learning pipeline. The papers discuss different topics such as digital soil mapping, remote sensing image classification, and soil spectroscopy, but they do not include any information about a deep learning pipeline code repository.

An example of a paper that uses a deep learning method is "UAV-based classification of maritime Antarctic vegetation types using GEOBIA and random forest" by Duan et al. (2022). However, this paper uses the Random Forest algorithm, which is not a deep learning method.

Another paper that uses machine learning techniques is "Prediction and mapping of soil clay and sand contents using visible and near-infrared spectroscopy" by Tümsavas¸ et al. (2018). This paper uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for prediction, but it does not provide a code repository link.

Therefore, I cannot provide a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
