The criteria used to split the data for training the deep learning model, specifically the AlexNet convolutional neural network (AN), involves dividing the dataset into a training set and a testing set. In this particular study, 80% of the dataset was used for training, while the remaining 20% was used for testing. This division was random and applied to the entire dataset, which consisted of 6570 pictures.

Furthermore, to gauge the performance consistency of the algorithms, the training-testing process was repeated 10 times for each algorithm, using the same training and testing picture subsets in each replicate run. This approach allowed for a more robust assessment of the model's performance.

It is important to note that the context does not mention the use of a validation set in this study. While the use of a validation set is a common practice in deep learning to fine-tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, it appears that it was not implemented in this particular research. However, this does not necessarily mean that the data splitting criteria used in this study are inadequate, as the specific research question and context may have influenced the decision not to include a validation set.
