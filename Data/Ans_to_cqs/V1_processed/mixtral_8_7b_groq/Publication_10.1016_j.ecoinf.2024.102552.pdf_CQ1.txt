The provided context does not give specific details about the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of "NAIP" and "historical imagery" as inputs for machine learning classification, which implies the use of remote sensing data, most likely in the form of aerial or satellite imagery.

Additionally, the authors mention the potential use of "online spectral libraries or other remote sensing products with more detailed spectral information and coarser spatial detail" to refine classifications. This further supports the idea that remote sensing data is being used as input for the deep learning pipeline.

The authors also mention the possibility of using "more detailed classification" for individual sites or images, which could imply the use of higher resolution imagery or other forms of data for specific areas of interest.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data, it does imply the use of remote sensing data, specifically aerial or satellite imagery, as inputs for the deep learning pipeline.
