While the provided context does not contain information about specific preprocessing steps for a particular deep learning model, it is common to perform certain preprocessing techniques such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning before training a deep learning model.

Normalization is a process that adjusts the range of input features to ensure that all features contribute equally to the learning process. This is often achieved by scaling the input data between a specific range, typically between 0 and 1. In some cases, more advanced normalization techniques like mean normalization or standardization may be used.

Scaling is another preprocessing technique that adjusts the range of input features to improve the model's performance. This is particularly important when the input features have different scales or units. For example, if one feature is measured in meters while another is measured in kilometers, scaling can help ensure that both features are given equal importance during training.

Cleaning is an essential preprocessing step that involves removing or correcting errors, inconsistencies, or missing values in the input data. This step is crucial for ensuring that the model learns from high-quality data and reduces the risk of learning from noisy or incorrect information.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps, it is common to perform normalization, scaling, and cleaning before training a deep learning model. These steps help ensure that the input data is of high quality, properly scaled, and contributes equally to the learning process.
