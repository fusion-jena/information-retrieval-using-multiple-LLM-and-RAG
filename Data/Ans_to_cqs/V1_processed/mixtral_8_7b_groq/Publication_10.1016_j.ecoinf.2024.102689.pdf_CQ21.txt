Based on the provided context, there are mentions of specific metrics used for evaluating the performance of the model, but there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, I can provide some common postprocessing steps that are often used in machine learning tasks.



In the context of machine learning model training, postprocessing typically involves several steps to further analyze and interpret the model's performance. While the specific postprocessing steps are not mentioned in the provided context, I will outline some common ones below.

1. Metrics calculation: After evaluating the model on a test set, various performance metrics are calculated. In the context, recognition accuracy and recall are mentioned. Other common metrics include precision, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC).

2. Confusion matrix: A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification model. It presents the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. From the confusion matrix, other metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall can be calculated.

3. Saliency maps: Saliency maps are a way to visualize the importance of input features for a specific model prediction. They highlight the parts of the input that the model finds most relevant for its decision. Saliency maps are not explicitly mentioned in the context, but they can be a useful tool for understanding and interpreting model predictions.

4. Model interpretation and explanation: This step involves analyzing the model's behavior and understanding how it makes predictions. Techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) or LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) can be used to gain insights into the model's decision-making process.

5. Error analysis: Error analysis involves investigating the cases where the model performs poorly. This can help identify patterns or issues in the data that the model struggles with, leading to improvements in the model or the data preprocessing steps.

Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps most likely involved are metrics calculation and generating data visualizations to compare the proposed model with the benchmark model. However, the context does not explicitly mention other common postprocessing steps like generating a confusion matrix, creating saliency maps, or performing error analysis.
