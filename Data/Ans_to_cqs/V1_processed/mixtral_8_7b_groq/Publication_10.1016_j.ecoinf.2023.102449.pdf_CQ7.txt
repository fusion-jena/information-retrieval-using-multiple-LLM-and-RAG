The text provided does not give specific details about the criteria used to split the data for training, testing, and validation of the deep learning model. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to split the data into these three sets to evaluate the model's performance and prevent overfitting.

Typically, the data is split into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and select the best model, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final model's performance.

The exact proportions for splitting the data can vary depending on the size and complexity of the dataset. A common approach is to use 70% of the data for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. Alternatively, a 60-20-20 or 80-10-10 split can also be used.

In some cases, the data may be split based on other factors, such as time or location. For example, if the data is time-series data, it may be split based on time, with the training set containing data from an earlier time period and the testing set containing data from a later time period. Similarly, if the data is geographical, it may be split based on location, with the training set containing data from one region and the testing set containing data from another region.

Overall, while the text does not provide specific details about the criteria used to split the data for the deep learning model, it is clear that the model involves several stages of processing, including pre-processing, encoding, temporal framing, bottlenecking, reparameterization, decoding, and post-processing. These stages involve various operations, such as convolution, batch normalization, residual blocks, downsampling, upsampling, and linear layers, which are used to extract features from the input data and generate the final output.
