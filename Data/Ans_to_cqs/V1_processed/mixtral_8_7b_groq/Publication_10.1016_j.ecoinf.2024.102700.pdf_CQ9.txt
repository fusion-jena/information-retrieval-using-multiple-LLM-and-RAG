Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text mentions the use of deep learning strategies, specifically neural networks, in the study by Cazau et al., but it does not provide any details about the data repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.

However, the context does mention that the literature search considered studies available in two databases, Scopus and Web of Science, until 31 December 2022. It is possible that the data repository is linked to one of these studies or is available in one of these databases. Therefore, I would recommend checking these databases for further information on the deep learning pipeline and its data repository.

Additionally, the context mentions that the study considered various data sources, including ecological surveys, which exhibit poor quality and lack comprehensive metadata. Therefore, it is possible that the data repository is not publicly available due to concerns about data quality or the need to protect sensitive information.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline, it is possible that the repository is available in one of the databases used in the literature search. It is also possible that the repository is not publicly available due to concerns about data quality or sensitivity.
