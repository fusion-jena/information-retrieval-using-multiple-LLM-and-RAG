Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The articles and appendix focus on smart farming categories, data analytics techniques, and the need for Internet of Things (IoT) technology in the domain, but they do not mention any specific strategies for monitoring model performance during training.

However, it can be inferred that some form of monitoring or evaluation would be necessary to ensure the effectiveness of the designed reference architecture in the Indonesian dairy and fish farming case study. This might include techniques such as cross-validation, early stopping, or monitoring metrics such as loss or accuracy over time.

In addition, the focus on data analytics techniques such as machine learning, deep learning, and statistical-based models suggests that these methods could be used to monitor model performance during training. For example, machine learning models can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, while deep learning models can be evaluated using metrics such as loss, accuracy, and confusion matrix.

Overall, while there is no explicit information provided on the strategy implemented to monitor model performance during training, it is likely that some form of monitoring or evaluation would be necessary to ensure the effectiveness of the models used in the smart farming domain.
