The performance of the deep learning model for predicting the concentration of atmospheric CO was evaluated using the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metrics. These metrics were used to assess the differences between the predicted and actual values, thereby indicating the accuracy of the model. The MAPE values of the SGRU model were found to be lower than those of the other models, including ARIMA, SARIMA, ETS, HWETS, SVR, and SLSTM, indicating a higher accuracy of prediction for the SGRU model. The RMSE values were not provided in the given context, but it is another commonly used metric for evaluating the accuracy of regression models.

The MAPE metric is a popular evaluation metric for forecasting models, and it measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values as a percentage of actual values. It is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values divided by the actual values, and then multiplied by 100%. A lower MAPE value indicates a better performance of the model.

The RMSE metric measures the standard deviation of the prediction errors, and it is calculated as the square root of the average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values. It is a commonly used metric for evaluating the accuracy of regression models, and a lower RMSE value indicates a better performance of the model.

In summary, the performance of the deep learning model for predicting the concentration of atmospheric CO was evaluated using the MAPE and RMSE metrics. The SGRU model outperformed other models, including ARIMA, SARIMA, ETS, HWETS, SVR, and SLSTM, in terms of MAPE values, indicating a higher accuracy of prediction.
