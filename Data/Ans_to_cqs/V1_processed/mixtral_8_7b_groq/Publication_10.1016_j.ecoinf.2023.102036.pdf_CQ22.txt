The context provided does not specify the exact metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that TensorBoard, a visualization tool from TensorFlow, was used to study the performance of the runs. TensorFlow supports a variety of metrics for evaluating models, including common ones such as accuracy, precision, and recall. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions made, precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made, and recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances. Therefore, it is highly likely that at least one of these metrics, or possibly others, were used to evaluate the model's performance.
