The provided context does not give information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context includes a table (Table 7) with parameters and performance results of a MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) model, but it does not mention any details about the hardware used for training. Similarly, the text describes the MLPnn-MC model, which integrates the MLP algorithm and Markov chain for land use and land cover (LULC) classification, but it does not provide information about the hardware resources. Lastly, Table 1 lists the raster and supplementary data used in the study, but it does not mention any hardware details. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
