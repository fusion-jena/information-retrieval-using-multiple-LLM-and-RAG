The provided context does not directly discuss the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, it does contain information about various statistical methods and data analysis techniques.


The context provided focuses on data analysis, spatial statistics, and functional data analysis. While it does not explicitly mention regularization methods used in deep learning, it is still relevant to discuss dropout and L2 regularization as they are common techniques to prevent overfitting.

Dropout is a regularization technique used in deep learning to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping out, or deactivating, neurons during training. This helps to promote independence among the neurons and improves the model's generalization capability.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is another common technique used to prevent overfitting. It adds a penalty term to the loss function, which is proportional to the sum of squares of the model's weights. This encourages smaller weights, reducing the complexity of the model and helping to improve its generalization performance.

In summary, the provided context does not discuss dropout or L2 regularization explicitly. However, these techniques are essential for preventing overfitting in deep learning pipelines. Dropout randomly deactivates neurons during training, promoting independence and improving generalization, while L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, encouraging smaller weights and reducing model complexity.
