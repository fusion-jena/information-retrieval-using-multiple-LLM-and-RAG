The optimization of hyperparameters in machine learning models, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), is crucial for achieving good performance. However, the provided context does not give specific details on how the hyperparameters of the models are optimized in the mentioned studies.

Generally, there are several methods for optimizing hyperparameters, including grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization. Grid search involves creating a grid of hyperparameter values and training the model for each combination of values. The combination that results in the best performance is then selected. Random search, on the other hand, involves randomly selecting hyperparameter values from a defined range and training the model for each selected combination. Bayesian optimization uses a probabilistic approach to select the most promising hyperparameter values to train the model.

In the context of SVM, some of the hyperparameters that may need optimization include the regularization parameter, the kernel function, and the kernel coefficient. The regularization parameter controls the trade-off between fitting the training data and avoiding overfitting. The kernel function determines the type of nonlinearity used in the SVM, and the kernel coefficient controls the width of the kernel.

In the study by Leng et al. (2017), they used SVM to predict the concentration of airborne particle-bound metals. However, the context does not provide information on how they optimized the hyperparameters of the SVM model. Similarly, in the study by Li et al. (2014), they developed an ecological security evaluation method based on the ecological footprint, but the context does not provide details on the optimization of hyperparameters.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not give specific details on how the hyperparameters of the models are optimized, there are several methods available for optimizing hyperparameters, including grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization. The optimization of hyperparameters is crucial for achieving good performance in machine learning models, including SVM.
