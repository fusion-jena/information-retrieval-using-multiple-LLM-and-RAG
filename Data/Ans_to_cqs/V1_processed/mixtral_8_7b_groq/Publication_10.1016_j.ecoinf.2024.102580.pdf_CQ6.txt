Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved to prepare the data. According to the provided context, these steps include normalization, scaling, and cleaning.

In the context of ecological informatics and deep learning models used for vegetation mapping and turtle detection, the images are first reduced in resolution to 1000 Ã— 1333 pixels. This step may be considered a form of scaling, as it reduces the size of the input data.

Next, the three color channels of the images are normalized by subtracting the means and dividing by the standard deviations per channel. The means and standard deviations used for this normalization are based on the ImageNet dataset, which is a large dataset of natural images used in the training of many deep learning models. Specifically, the mean values used are [0.485, 0.456, 0.406], and the standard deviations are [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]. Normalization is an important step in deep learning as it helps to ensure that all input features are on a similar scale, which can improve the training of the model.

Cleaning of the data may also be an important preprocessing step, although it is not specifically mentioned in the provided context. Cleaning can involve removing or correcting any errors or inconsistencies in the data, such as missing values or outliers. This step can help to improve the accuracy and reliability of the deep learning model.

Overall, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model can include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. These steps are important for preparing the data and improving the training of the model.
