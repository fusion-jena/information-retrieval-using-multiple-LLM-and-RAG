The provided context discusses the use of a hybrid MCMC algorithm and a least squares (LS) algorithm with a genetic algorithm (GA) for processing data, but it does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing in a deep learning pipeline.

In general, there are several techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing in a deep learning pipeline, including:

1. **Stratified sampling**: This technique involves dividing the data into strata based on the distribution of the target variable, and then randomly sampling an equal number of observations from each stratum. This helps to ensure that the training and test sets have a similar distribution of the target variable.
2. **Oversampling**: This technique involves randomly duplicating observations from the minority class in the training set to balance it with the majority class. This helps to prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.
3. **Undersampling**: This technique involves randomly removing observations from the majority class in the training set to balance it with the minority class. This helps to prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.
4. **Diverse data collection**: This technique involves collecting data from a variety of sources and ensuring that the data is representative of the population. This helps to prevent the model from being biased towards a particular subset of the population.

It's important to note that the choice of technique depends on the specific dataset and the problem at hand. In some cases, a combination of techniques may be necessary to effectively address data bias.
