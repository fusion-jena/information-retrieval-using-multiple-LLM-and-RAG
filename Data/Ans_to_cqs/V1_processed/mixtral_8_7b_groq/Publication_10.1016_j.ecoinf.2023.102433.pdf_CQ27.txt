Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the deployment of a trained deep learning model. However, we can infer some practices that were followed during the development of the system that might be relevant for model deployment.



The system was developed using Python 3.9, and two processes were deployed: a static process and a periodic process. Each process was contained in a separate virtual environment, which suggests that the dependencies were isolated from the system, and reciprocally. This practice is beneficial for model deployment, as it ensures that the required libraries and packages are available and compatible with the model.

Moreover, the system used the nasawebservice package, which provides methods for data ingestion from the NASA server. The execute\_many() method returns a lazy iterator, which improves the memory management for data ingestion operations. This feature is useful for model deployment, as it allows handling large volumes of data efficiently.

Additionally, the system used virtual machines (VMs) for deployment. This practice is common for model deployment, as it provides a controlled environment for running the model and ensures that the required resources are available.

Regarding model serialization, the context does not provide information on how the trained deep learning model was saved and loaded. However, Python provides several libraries for model serialization, such as pickle, joblib, and torch.save(). These libraries allow saving the model's architecture, weights, and biases in a file, which can be loaded later for inference.

In summary, although the context does not provide explicit information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, we can infer some practices that were followed during the development of the system that might be relevant for model deployment. These practices include using virtual environments, handling large volumes of data efficiently, and using virtual machines for deployment. Additionally, the system used the nasawebservice package, which provides methods for data ingestion that can be useful for model deployment. However, the context does not provide information on how the trained deep learning model was serialized and loaded.
