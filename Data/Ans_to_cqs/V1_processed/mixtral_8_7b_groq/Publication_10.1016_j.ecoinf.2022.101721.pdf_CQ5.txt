The provided context does not include information about deep learning pipelines or datasets commonly used in deep learning, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it focuses on species identification and population size estimation using machine learning and statistical methods.

However, I can provide a general answer to the query about common datasets used in deep learning:


 In deep learning, several benchmark datasets are commonly used for training and evaluating models. These include:

1. MNIST: A dataset of handwritten digits, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each of size 28x28 pixels, with 10 classes (0-9).
2. CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100: Image datasets consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 and 100 classes, respectively, with 6,000 images per class. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
3. ImageNet: A large-scale image dataset with over 14 million images, organized according to the WordNet hierarchy, with 1,000 object categories for the ILSVRC (ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge) competition.

These datasets are widely used for tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation.
