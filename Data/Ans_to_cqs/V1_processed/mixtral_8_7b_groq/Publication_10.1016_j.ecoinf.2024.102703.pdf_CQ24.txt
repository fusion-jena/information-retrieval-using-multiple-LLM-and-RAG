The provided context does not contain information about deep learning pipelines or strategies employed to handle randomness in such pipelines, including the use of random seed values. The context focuses on the study of the optical properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in water samples from the Erhai watershed in China.

In this study, the authors used the LASSO model for variable selection and statistical regularization to enhance the prediction accuracy of their model. They analyzed the impact of nutrient and environmental factors on DOM, including pH, water temperature, and trophic state index (TSI). The TSI ranged from 31 to 67, and the values of Fn(355), an optical property of DOM, ranged from 1.16 to 2.97. The study found that pH consistently correlates with FDOM, with the highest pH values found under light-eutrophic conditions.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query regarding deep learning pipelines and strategies for handling randomness based on the given context.
