The provided context does not contain information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. There are references to various studies that have utilized artificial neural networks and deep learning techniques for different applications such as vegetation biomass density prediction, recruitment forecasting of yellowfin tuna, urban built-up area extraction, and land use and land cover changes mapping. However, there is no mention of the cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform) that was used for deploying these models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
