Based on the information provided, there is no explicit mention of how the hyperparameters of the proposed classification network are optimized. The text mentions the use of a classification network that outperforms other models such as ResNet50 and ViT in classifying objects of different sizes, and provides accuracy percentages for the "medium" and "small" categories. However, it does not include details about the optimization techniques used for the hyperparameters of the proposed model.

Hyperparameter optimization is an essential step in building machine learning models, as it can significantly impact the model's performance. Common methods for hyperparameter optimization include grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization. Grid search involves systematically trying all possible combinations of hyperparameters within a predefined range, while random search selects hyperparameters at random from a specified distribution. Bayesian optimization, on the other hand, uses a probabilistic model to estimate the performance of different hyperparameter configurations and selects the most promising ones for evaluation.

Without information on how the hyperparameters of the proposed classification network are optimized, it is difficult to assess the validity of the reported results fully. However, it is still possible to evaluate the model's performance based on the accuracy percentages provided in the text.

In summary, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the proposed classification network are optimized. Hyperparameter optimization is an essential step in building machine learning models, and common methods include grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization. The proposed classification network's performance can still be evaluated based on the accuracy percentages provided in the text.
