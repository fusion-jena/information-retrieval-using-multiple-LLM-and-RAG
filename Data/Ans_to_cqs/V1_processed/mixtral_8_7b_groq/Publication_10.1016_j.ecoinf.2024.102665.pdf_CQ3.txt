The provided context does not include specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for underwater species detection. However, it does mention the use of deep learning models for detecting and classifying underwater species in several studies.

In general, there are various data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines for object detection and segmentation. Here are some of the commonly used ones:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing a rectangle (bounding box) around the object of interest in an image. The bounding box should be tight enough to enclose the object while excluding the background. This technique is commonly used for object detection tasks.
2. Instance segmentation: This technique involves segmenting each instance of an object in an image. It is more precise than bounding box annotation as it provides a pixel-level mask for each object instance. This technique is commonly used for image segmentation tasks.
3. Semantic segmentation: This technique involves segmenting objects in an image based on their class labels. It does not differentiate between individual instances of the same class. This technique is commonly used for scene understanding tasks.
4. Landmark annotation: This technique involves identifying and labeling key points or landmarks on an object. It is commonly used for facial recognition, human pose estimation, and animal tracking tasks.
5. Polygon annotation: This technique involves drawing a polygon around the object of interest in an image. It is more precise than bounding box annotation and is commonly used for object detection tasks that require precise object boundaries.

In the context of underwater species detection, data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation and instance segmentation are commonly used for annotating fish, corals, sponges, and other benthic organisms in underwater images. These annotations are used to train deep learning models to detect and classify underwater species in new images. However, the specific data annotation techniques used in the studies mentioned in the provided context are not specified.
