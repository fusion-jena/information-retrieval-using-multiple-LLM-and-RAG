The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the following metrics: true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN). These metrics are used to calculate the accuracy, precision, and recall of the model.

True positive (TP) represents the number of endemic birds that are correctly detected as such. True negative (TN) represents the number of non-endemic birds that are correctly identified as non-endemic. False positive (FP) represents the number of non-endemic birds that are incorrectly detected as endemic. False negative (FN) represents the number of endemic birds that are not detected by the predictive system.

Accuracy is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of input samples. It is calculated as:

Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)

Precision is the ratio of the number of true positives to the total number of positive predictions. It is calculated as:

Precision = TP / (TP + FP)

Recall is the ratio of the number of true positives to the total number of actual positives. It is calculated as:

Recall = TP / (TP + FN)

In the study, Inception-ResNet-v2 was found to have a high accuracy of 97.11% in detecting endemic bird species. However, the precision and recall are not provided in the context. It is important to consider both accuracy and recall when evaluating the performance of a deep learning model, especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets. A high accuracy may not necessarily mean that the model is performing well if the recall is low. Similarly, a high recall may not be sufficient if the precision is low. Therefore, it is essential to consider both precision and recall when evaluating the performance of a deep learning model.
