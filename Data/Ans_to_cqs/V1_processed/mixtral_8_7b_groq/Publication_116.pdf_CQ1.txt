The provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for plant identification. However, it does provide details about the preprocessing and network architecture used for the plant identification task.

In the hand-crafted feature extraction experiment, a biased dataset was created by randomly taking 70% of the data in dataset D for training and 30% for testing. The distribution of data for each species in dataset D was not explicitly mentioned, but it was stated that the distribution depends on the number of photos per species. This suggests that the data was collected through some form of image acquisition, such as photography or scanning.

In the deep learning experiment, no segmentation was applied to the data, and it was resized to 224x224 pixels before running the network on the data. This implies that the raw data used in this experiment was likely collected as images.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly state the methods used for collecting raw data, it can be inferred that the data was collected as images through photography or scanning.
