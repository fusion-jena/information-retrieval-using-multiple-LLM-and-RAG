Unfortunately, there is no specific link provided in the context regarding the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses various aspects of using Big Data related to environmental conditions, air pollution, and the course of COVID-19 cases. However, it does not mention any data repository link for the deep learning pipeline.

The sources cited in the context include research papers and reports from WHO and Wikipedia, but none of them provide information on the data repository link for the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to this query.
