The criteria used to determine when training is complete in object detection models is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is common practice in machine learning to monitor validation loss or metrics related to the task as an indicator of convergence. When the validation loss plateaus or stops decreasing significantly, even if the training loss continues to decrease, it suggests that the model has learned enough from the training data and further training may lead to overfitting.

In the context of object detection, the evaluation metric could be Average Precision (AP) calculated over different pixel size ranges (APs, APm, APl) as described in Table 4. These metrics assess the precision of the model in detecting bird instances of varying sizes. Therefore, monitoring the AP over different pixel size ranges on the validation set could be a potential criterion to determine when training is complete.

Moreover, the provided context highlights the challenges of noise and environmental clutter in the bird detection dataset. These factors could affect the model's ability to learn the features of specific bird species, thereby impacting its detection and recognition capabilities. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that the model has learned robust features that generalize well to complex, real-world ecological settings.

In summary, while the exact criteria for determining training completion are not specified in the given context, it is reasonable to monitor the validation AP over different pixel size ranges and observe the model's performance in complex, noisy environments as indicators of convergence.
