The context provided does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search or random search. However, it does give some insight into the initialization of the HMM parameters.

The distribution parameters B of the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) are initialized using a sequential combination of the k-means clustering algorithm and the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). The k-means algorithm is used to cluster the data, and then the GMM is used to model the distribution of each cluster. This is done to determine the mean (μ) and covariance matrix (Σ) of the emission distribution. The mixture weight (σ) is also a part of the distribution parameters.

For the WT-HMM algorithm, the context suggests that varying dataset sizes were used to train the model over 10 runs. The average, maximum, and minimum accuracy and F1-score were recorded for each dataset size. This process might implicitly involve some form of hyperparameter tuning, as different runs could correspond to different initializations or configurations of the model. However, the specific methods are not mentioned.

In conclusion, while the context provides information on how the initial parameters of the HMM are determined, it does not explicitly mention the methods used for hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search or random search.
