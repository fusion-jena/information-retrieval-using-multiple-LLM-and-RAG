The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does discuss the data splitting approach used for machine learning models (MLMs), which can be informative.

In the described methodology, the data was split using a 10-fold cross-validation (CV) design. This means that the entire dataset was divided into 10 equal parts or folds. For each of the 10 runs of the cross-validation procedure, one fold was reserved as a validation set, and the remaining 70% of the data was used to train the model. This process was repeated 10 times, with a different fold being used as the validation set each time. 

However, this approach is specific to MLMs and not deep learning models. In deep learning, the data splitting criteria often involve a training set, a validation set, and a test set. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and make decisions during the model building process, and the test set is used to evaluate the final model's performance.

Given that the context focuses on MLMs and not deep learning, it's possible that the data splitting criteria for deep learning models were not specified in the text. Therefore, without additional information, it's not possible to provide a definitive answer to this query based on the provided context.
