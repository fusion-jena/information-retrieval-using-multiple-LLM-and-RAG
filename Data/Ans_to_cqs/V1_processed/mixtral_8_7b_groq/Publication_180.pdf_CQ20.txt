The context provided does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that TensorFlow, a software platform for deep learning, was used in this project. TensorFlow supports the use of both CPUs and GPUs for training deep learning models. In fact, TensorFlow has built-in support for GPUs, which can significantly speed up the training process compared to using a CPU alone.

Moreover, TensorFlow also supports the use of TPUs (Tensor Processing Units), which are custom-built ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) designed specifically for machine learning tasks. TPUs can provide even faster training times than GPUs, but they are less commonly available than CPUs and GPUs.

Therefore, while the context does not provide specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, it is likely that either a GPU or a TPU was used, given that the project involved deep learning and used TensorFlow.
