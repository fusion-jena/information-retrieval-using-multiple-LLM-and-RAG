Based on the information provided, it is not explicitly stated which cloud platform, such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform, was used to deploy the deep learning model. The machine configuration information table only provides details about the hardware and software specifications of the local machine or server used for data processing. It includes details about the central processing unit (CPU), memory, video card, operating system, CUDA version, and the programming languages and libraries used for the project.

However, it is mentioned that the Transformer model, which is a deep neural network architecture originally designed for natural language processing, was applied to computer vision tasks. This implies that the model was likely trained and deployed using a high-performance computing environment, which could be located on-premises or in the cloud.

Therefore, while the specific cloud platform used for deployment is not mentioned in the provided context, it is clear that a powerful computing environment was used to train and deploy the deep learning model.
