The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This information can be inferred from the context provided in the first paragraph, which mentions the use of CNNs for the customized architecture. Additionally, the details about the architecture of the customized models further confirm the use of CNNs. The customized models are composed of three convolutional layers, each followed by dropout and a max pooling layer. This is a common architecture for CNNs, and there is no mention of any other type of deep learning model such as RNN or Transformer being used in the pipeline. Therefore, it can be concluded that a CNN is the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
