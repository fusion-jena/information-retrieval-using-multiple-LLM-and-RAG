The provided context does not give information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. It mentions that the data used in the study consists of labeled videos of coral reef fish, which were cropped and processed to create a training database of 13,000 fish thumbnails. However, it does not provide a link to the repository where this data is stored. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
