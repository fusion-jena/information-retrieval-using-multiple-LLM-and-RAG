Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. It mentions the use of the "serf dataset" but does not specify where this dataset can be found or accessed. Therefore, I am unable to provide the requested link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other data repository.
