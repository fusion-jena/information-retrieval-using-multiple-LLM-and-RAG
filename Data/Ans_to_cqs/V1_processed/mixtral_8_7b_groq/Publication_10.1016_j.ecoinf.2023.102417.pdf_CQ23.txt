The text provided discusses several measures that were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model for biocrust image data. However, it does not explicitly mention the use of diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Instead, it highlights the importance of considering the transferability of the model when training and application datasets are recorded with different devices, illumination conditions, or acquisition geometries.

To address this issue, the authors created specific datasets tailored to the desired application, focusing on the problem of insufficient transferability of deep learning models between datasets obtained with different camera sensors. This approach aims to increase the model's transferability to datasets with similar statistical properties.

In addition, the authors emphasized the need for training the model on data that resemble the data on which the model will be applied later. This is crucial, especially when the model is applied over a longer period of time, as data distributions might change due to different recording conditions or devices.

While not explicitly stated, the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model can be inferred as follows:

1. Domain adaptation: By focusing on the problem of insufficient transferability between datasets obtained with different camera sensors, the authors applied the principles of domain adaptation. This approach aims to increase the model's ability to generalize to new datasets with similar statistical properties.
2. Specific datasets: Creating tailored datasets for the desired application ensures that the training data better represent the data the model will encounter during application. This can help reduce overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize.
3. Training on representative data: Emphasizing the importance of training the model on data that resemble the application data suggests that the training dataset was carefully selected to be representative of the problem domain. This can help ensure that the model learns relevant features and patterns that are applicable to new, unseen data.

In summary, although the text does not explicitly mention diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, it implies that the authors addressed the generalizability of the deep learning model through domain adaptation, creating specific datasets, and training on representative data.
