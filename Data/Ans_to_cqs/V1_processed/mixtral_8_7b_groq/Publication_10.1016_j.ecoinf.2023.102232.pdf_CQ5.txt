Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline in this particular study did not involve any of the commonly used datasets in machine learning literature, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, this study focused on a specific scientific problem where the dataset was collected and processed to fit the model.

The dataset used in this study pertains to a field dataset, which was analyzed using a hybrid MCMC algorithm. This algorithm provides a series of independent chains, each containing a trace of values for each parameter to estimate. The traces corresponding to each chain are stored in specific text files and can be further analyzed to obtain the final parameter values, their distribution, and their associated uncertainty.

In this study, the genetic algorithm (GA) was used to generate four random combinations of initial values, which were considered as input for the LS procedure. The GA was run for a total of nGAC = 2 cycles, leading to a total number of nTGA = 1536 LS fit evaluations.

The final set of parameters was calculated by considering the second dataset and generating the a posteriori distribution of the parameters by merging all the traces of each of the correct simulations in a single database. The statistical distribution of the parameters was reported by its mean and the standard deviation of the traces of the database of MCMC simulations.

Therefore, the datasets used in this study were specific to the scientific problem being addressed and were processed and analyzed using the described hybrid MCMC algorithm and genetic algorithm.
