Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The context discusses various models used for predicting aboveground biomass (AGB), including SVR, XGBoost, and Random Forest (RF), but it does not mention deep learning models.

However, some of the techniques mentioned in the context are commonly used to enhance the generalizability of models, and these could potentially be applied to deep learning models as well. For instance:

1. **Diverse dataset**: The context highlights the importance of integrating various variable sets, including spectral bands, SRTM DEM, and vegetation-derived indices, to improve the predictive outcomes. Using a diverse dataset with multiple variable sets could also benefit deep learning models by providing a richer feature space.

2. **Cross-validation**: Although not explicitly mentioned, cross-validation is a standard technique for assessing the performance and generalizability of models. It involves dividing the dataset into multiple folds, training the model on different subsets, and evaluating its performance on the remaining portions. This can help to ensure that the model's performance is not overly dependent on specific subsets of the data.

3. **Stratified splitting**: This technique involves dividing the data into subsets in a way that maintains the same distribution of key variables in each subset. This can help to ensure that the training, validation, and test sets are representative of the overall data distribution, which can improve the model's ability to generalize.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not specifically mention the use of these techniques for a deep learning model, they are commonly used methods to enhance the generalizability of models and could be applied to deep learning models as well.
