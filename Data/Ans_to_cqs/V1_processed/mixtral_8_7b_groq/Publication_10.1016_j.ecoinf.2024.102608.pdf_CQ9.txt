Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of a data repository for the deep learning pipeline. The articles and abstracts mentioned in the context do not specify where the data or code for their deep learning pipelines are stored or shared. It is a common practice in research to share data and code to promote transparency and reproducibility, but this information is sometimes not included in the published articles.

However, some of the articles mention the use of publicly available datasets, such as Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellite data. These datasets can be accessed through platforms like the US Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Explorer or the European Space Agency (ESA) Copernicus Open Access Hub.

Additionally, some researchers share their code and data through personal or institutional repositories, such as GitHub or university-specific data repositories. It may be worth reaching out to the authors of the articles for more information on their data and code availability.

In summary, while the specific data repository for the deep learning pipeline is not mentioned in the provided context, some of the datasets used in the research are publicly available, and it may be possible to obtain the code and data from the authors directly.
