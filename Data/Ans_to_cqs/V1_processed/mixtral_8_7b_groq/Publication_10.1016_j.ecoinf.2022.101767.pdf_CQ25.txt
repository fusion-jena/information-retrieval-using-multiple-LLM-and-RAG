Based on the provided context, it is not explicitly stated what type of deep learning model is being used or its specific purpose (classification, segmentation, detection, etc.). However, we can infer some information about the potential use of a deep learning model in this study.

The researchers analyzed video data with various factors, such as thumbnail information, the number of subscribers and uploaded videos on each channel, and the presence/absence of wild bird species in each video. They used a machine learning algorithm to select important video factors that affect the number of views.

In the context of this study, a deep learning model might be used for tasks such as:

1. Object detection: To identify and locate objects like cameras or binoculars in the video thumbnails, as these objects were classified as separate categories.
2. Wildlife detection: To detect and identify wild bird species in the videos, as the researchers analyzed the relationship between the number of views and the presence of specific bird species.
3. Image classification: To classify thumbnail characteristics into the six predefined categories (people, birds, objects, scenery, text, and food).

While the text does not explicitly mention deep learning, the complexity of the tasks and the use of machine learning suggest that a deep learning model could be employed for these purposes. However, without further information, this is just an educated guess based on the given context.
