The provided context discusses the use of data augmentation strategies to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, but it does not explicitly mention the use of regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization.

Data augmentation is a common technique used to increase the size of the training set and prevent overfitting by creating new training examples through various transformations of the original images. In this study, the authors used horizontal flip, Gaussian noise addition, and contrast reduction as data augmentation strategies. These methods help to increase the variability of the training data, which can improve the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

However, data augmentation alone may not be sufficient to prevent overfitting, especially when dealing with a small set of images, as was the case in this study. Regularization techniques, such as dropout and L2 regularization, can be used in conjunction with data augmentation to further reduce overfitting.

Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly sets a fraction of the neurons in a layer to zero during training, which helps to prevent overfitting by reducing the co-adaptation of neurons. L2 regularization, on the other hand, adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This encourages the model to learn smaller weights, which can help to prevent overfitting by reducing the complexity of the model.

In summary, while the provided context discusses the use of data augmentation strategies to prevent overfitting, it does not explicitly mention the use of regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization. These techniques can be used in conjunction with data augmentation to further reduce overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.
