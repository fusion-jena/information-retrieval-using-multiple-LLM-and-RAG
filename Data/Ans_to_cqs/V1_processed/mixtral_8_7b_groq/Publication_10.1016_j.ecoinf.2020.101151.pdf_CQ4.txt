Based on the context provided, there is no explicit mention of specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling being applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, there is a reference to a "nine-cell approach" that led to improved prediction results. This approach likely involves averaging or smoothing data from nine adjacent grid cells to reduce inaccuracies within single cells.
