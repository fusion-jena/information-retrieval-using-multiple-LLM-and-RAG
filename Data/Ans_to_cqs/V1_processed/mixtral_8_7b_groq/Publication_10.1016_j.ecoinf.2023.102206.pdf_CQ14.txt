The provided context does not give specific information about how the hyperparameters of the model, excluding the refinement impact factor 'gamma,' are optimized. The text does not mention any methods such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization. The 'gamma' hyperparameter is kept constant at 10% for all experiments of IFTL and FTL.

In the context, the authors focus on the comparison of IFTL and FTL methods with different Transfer Understanding Representations (TUR) like ELM, GRNN, and SVR. They do not discuss the optimization of hyperparameters for these TUR models. The authors do mention that the refinement impact factor 'gamma' is set to 10% (Î³ = 0.1) for both IFTL and FTL, and it governs the impact of refinement in IFTL. However, they do not elaborate on the optimization process for this hyperparameter.

In summary, the provided context does not contain information on how the hyperparameters of the model, excluding 'gamma,' are optimized.
