The provided context does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention that a prediction error is obtained by comparing the predicted value Å·m+ma with the validation data ym+ma at different starting times. This suggests that some form of validation-based stopping criterion may be used, such as stopping training when the validation error stops decreasing or when it reaches a certain threshold. Additionally, the context mentions the use of a climate time series composed of 12 indices and the training of machine learning (ML) models with the object variable being the NINO3.4 index at a future time point, using explanatory variables derived from a segment of the time series. However, the specific training algorithm or stopping criterion used for these ML models is not provided. Therefore, while it is likely that some form of validation-based stopping criterion is used, the specific criteria cannot be determined from the given context.
