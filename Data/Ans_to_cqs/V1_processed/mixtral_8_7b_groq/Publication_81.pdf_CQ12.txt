The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is Elastic Net-Stacked Autoencoder (EN-SAE), which is a variant of a Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (SAE) with Elastic Net regularization. The SAE is a type of artificial neural network that is used for learning and extracting useful features from high-dimensional data. It consists of multiple layers of autoencoders, where each autoencoder is trained to reconstruct the input of the previous layer. The output of the last autoencoder is then used as the input to a softmax classifier for making predictions.

In the EN-SAE model, Elastic Net regularization is applied to the weights of the autoencoders to promote sparsity and prevent overfitting. Elastic Net is a linear combination of L1 and L2 regularization, which encourages the model to learn a sparse representation of the input data. This is particularly useful in the context of DNA barcode sequences, where the genetic characteristics of species belong to high-dimensional data, and directly combining a set of fully connected autoencoders often has little effect for extracting useful information.

The EN-SAE model is used in the ESK (EN-SAE with KDE) model proposed in the paper for classifying fish from different families based on DNA barcode sequences. The ESK model consists of three stages: (1) preprocessing the original data from DNA barcode sequences, (2) using EN-SAE to learn the deep features and obtain the outgroup score of each fish, and (3) using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to select a threshold based on the outgroup scores and classify fish from different families.

Therefore, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is Elastic Net-Stacked Autoencoder (EN-SAE), which is a sparse autoencoder that learns deep features from high-dimensional DNA barcode sequences and obtains an outgroup score for each fish. These scores are then used for classifying fish from different families using KDE.
