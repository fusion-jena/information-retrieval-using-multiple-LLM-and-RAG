The criteria used to determine when training is complete in the context provided is not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred that the training process involves a two-phase approach: first, training only the fully connected layer while keeping the ResNet-50 encoder frozen, followed by training the whole network to fine-tune and learn additional features specific to the dataset.

In the validation set, the classifier's performance is evaluated at species, genus, and subfamily levels of taxonomic identification. The number of misclassified images and accuracy are reported for both the train and validation sets. It can be inferred that the training process might be complete when there is no significant improvement in the validation set's accuracy or when the validation loss plateaus.

For instance, at the species level, the classifier achieved 98.78% accuracy in the validation set, with only 18 misclassified images out of 1472. This high accuracy and low misclassification rate suggest that the model has learned the relevant features and may not require further training. However, without explicit information on the training stopping criteria, this is an inferred conclusion.
