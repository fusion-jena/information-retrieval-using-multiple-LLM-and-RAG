Based on the provided context, the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline for forest biomass estimation are preprocessed Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data and field data.

The ALS data is a type of light detection and ranging data that measures the distance between the sensor and the ground by emitting laser pulses. In this case, the ALS data is preprocessed (Section 2.3) and then combined with the field data. The preprocessing of ALS data involves creating cylindrical plots based on the coordinates of the center of each field plot, followed by lidar data thinning to unify cloud density. Four point density levels are used, including 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10.0 points per m2, achieved by randomly selecting a specific number of points from each cloud subsection. These point counts are weighted by the ratio of first return versus all returns to simulate a uniform density of emitted laser pulses.

After preprocessing, descriptive statistics are calculated from each cloud subsection with a unified density. These statistics, referred to as predictors, are used in the deep learning pipeline.

The field data, on the other hand, is collected from the forest and includes information about the biomass. This data is combined with the preprocessed ALS data and further processed in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline for forest biomass estimation are preprocessed ALS data and field data. These data formats are used to calculate descriptive statistics and train the deep learning model for predicting forest biomass.
