The context provided does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the models. However, it is common practice in machine learning to use a validation loss plateau or a convergence of validation metrics as an indicator of training completion. This means that training continues until the model's performance on a validation set stops improving or reaches a satisfactory level. It's possible that this approach was used in the training of the models mentioned in the tables, but the specifics are not provided in the context.
