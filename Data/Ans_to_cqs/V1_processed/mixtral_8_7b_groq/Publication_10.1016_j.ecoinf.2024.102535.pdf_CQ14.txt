Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about how the hyperparameters of the models were optimized. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to the query.

However, the context does mention that the network architectures of the models evaluated in the experiments are described in detail in Fig. 9, and that each column in the figure contains results for each substratum characterization criteria. This suggests that the models were evaluated for different criteria, and possibly for different hyperparameters.

Additionally, the context mentions that the ensemble of networks reached similar scores to those obtained by each network individually, and that in general, the ensemble of networks reached results that are superior to most of those obtained with the individual models. This suggests that some form of hyperparameter optimization was performed, as the ensemble of networks would not be expected to perform better than individual models without careful tuning of hyperparameters.

Overall, while the specific method of hyperparameter optimization is not mentioned in the provided context, it is likely that some form of hyperparameter tuning was performed in order to achieve the results reported in the study.
