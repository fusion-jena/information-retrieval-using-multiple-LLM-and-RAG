Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context focuses on the data sources and methods used for processing NDVI, DEM, vegetation type, temperature, precipitation, radiation, road, GDP, and population data. However, it does not mention where the deep learning pipeline data or code is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
