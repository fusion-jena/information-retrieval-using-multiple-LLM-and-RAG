Based on the provided context, there is no information indicating which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model for forest biomass estimation. The context includes several studies that discuss the use of deep learning and machine learning techniques for estimating aboveground biomass using LiDAR and Landsat data. However, none of these studies mention the specific cloud platform used for deep learning model deployment.
