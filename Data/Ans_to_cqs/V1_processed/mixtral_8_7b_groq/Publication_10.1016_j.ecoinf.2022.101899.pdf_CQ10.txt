The provided context does not include any information about a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link for it. The context mainly discusses a study that analyzed forest areas using NDVI scores and recorded the percentage of vegetation with low NDVI scores. The study used the Code Editor tool and JavaScript to extract NDVI data and calculate mean NDVI scores for each forest area. The final dataset included the mean NDVI score, month date stamp, and forest vulnerability as the percentage of vegetation with low NDVI scores. The context also mentions that some images had to be excluded due to inappropriate NDVI estimates, lack of such estimates, and cloud coverage. However, there is no information about a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link for it.
