I'm sorry for any confusion, but the provided context does not contain information about the data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as Flipping, Rotating, or Scaling. The context focuses on research about land use/cover changes, growing season NDVI, human activities, and climate change in China. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given information.
