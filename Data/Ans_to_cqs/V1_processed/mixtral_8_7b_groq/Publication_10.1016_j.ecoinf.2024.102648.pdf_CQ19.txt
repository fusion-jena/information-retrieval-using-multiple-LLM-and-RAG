The context does not provide specific information about the framework used to build the deep learning model. Only the type of deep learning model, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), is mentioned. Two popular frameworks for building ANNs are TensorFlow and PyTorch. However, without further information, it is not possible to give a definitive answer.
