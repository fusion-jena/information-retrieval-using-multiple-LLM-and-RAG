In the context provided, there is no explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, it is mentioned that "independent testing data, i.e., same for all models, is used for model evaluation" (7 of 29). This suggests that the data was split into training and testing sets, and the same testing set was used for comparing the accuracy of various models.

Moreover, the deep learning model mentioned in the context is a Deep Neural Network (DNN) implemented using a specific network architecture (Figure 4). The DNN model's performance was improved by adding a batch normalization layer after hidden layer 2 and tuning the hyperparameters, such as the learning rate and batch size. However, there is no information about how the data was split for training and testing the DNN model.

In general, data splitting for deep learning model training involves dividing the dataset into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune the hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance.

Therefore, while the context provided does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it can be inferred that the data was split into training and testing sets, and possibly a validation set, for model evaluation.
