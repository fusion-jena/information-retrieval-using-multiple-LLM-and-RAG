The provided context does not include information about a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The article focuses on the development of spectral-phenological features for deep learning to understand the invasion of Spartina alterniflora, but it does not mention where the data and code for the deep learning pipeline are stored and made available for the community. Therefore, I cannot provide a data repository link based on the given context.
