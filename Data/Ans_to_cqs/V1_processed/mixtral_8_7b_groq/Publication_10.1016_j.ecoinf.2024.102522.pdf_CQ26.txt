The provided context does not contain specific information about the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss a study related to ecological informatics that uses various bioclimate, biological, and geographical environment factors as variables in their models.

In the context of this ecological study, techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling could be used during the data preprocessing stage to address potential data bias. Stratified splitting involves dividing the data into subgroups that are representative of the entire population, ensuring that each subset contains a similar proportion of observations for each class. Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to balance the class distribution in the dataset. Oversampling replicates samples from the minority class to reach a balance with the majority class, while undersampling reduces the number of samples from the majority class.

Additionally, diverse data collection is another technique that could be employed to minimize data bias. By gathering data from various sources, researchers can ensure that their dataset is more representative of the real-world scenario, thus reducing the likelihood of bias.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, it can be inferred that techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection could be applied in this study or any other deep learning pipeline to mitigate data bias.
