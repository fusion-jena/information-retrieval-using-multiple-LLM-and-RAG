The code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in this study is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The experiments were conducted using the Google Colab repository, which is a cloud-based platform that allows users to write and execute Python code through a browser. However, Google Colab is not a version control system like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.

It is possible that the authors did not make the code publicly available, or it could be hosted on a platform other than GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, without further information, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to this query.
