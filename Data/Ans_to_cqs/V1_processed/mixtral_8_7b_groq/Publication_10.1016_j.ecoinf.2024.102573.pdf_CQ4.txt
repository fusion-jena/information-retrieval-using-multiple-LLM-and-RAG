The data augmentation techniques applied in the described deep learning pipeline are changing audio speed, pitch shift, amplitude scaling (also known as gain modification), and adding Gaussian noise. These techniques are used to artificially enrich the dataset size and diversity while preserving the original semantic meaning of the data. However, the text suggests that the data augmentation was less effective than anticipated and encourages practitioners to try both waveform and time-frequency augmentation techniques for potential gain. It is also recommended to focus on sensible transformations that respect the physical meaning of time-frequency representations, as extreme image data augmentation methods may not be effective or trustworthy for audio classification tasks. The text does not mention techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling, which are commonly used for image data augmentation. Instead, the focus is on audio-specific transformations that maintain the semantic meaning of the audio data.
