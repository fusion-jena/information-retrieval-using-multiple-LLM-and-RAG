The provided context does not directly discuss the strategies employed to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of a specific random forests variant called Boruta in the context of ecological data analysis.

Boruta is a feature selection method for random forests that addresses the problem of randomness by permuting the input variables and comparing the importance scores of the original and permuted variables (Kursa and Rudnicki, 2010). This helps to determine whether the importance of each variable significantly differs from that of a random variable, thereby reducing the impact of randomness on feature selection.

In the context of deep learning, randomness can be handled in several ways. One common method is to set a random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results. This is particularly important in tasks such as hyperparameter tuning and model initialization, where randomness can affect the final model's performance.

Another way to handle randomness in deep learning is through the use of techniques such as dropout and batch normalization. Dropout randomly sets a fraction of input units to zero during training, which helps to prevent overfitting and improves the model's generalization performance (Srivastava et al., 2014). Batch normalization, on the other hand, normalizes the inputs of each batch to have zero mean and unit variance, which can improve the model's convergence speed and reduce the impact of randomness in the initialization of weights (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015).

Overall, while the provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, it does mention the use of a feature selection method that addresses randomness in the context of ecological data analysis. In deep learning, randomness can be handled through methods such as setting a random seed value, dropout, and batch normalization.
