The specific deep learning framework used to build the model is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model was built using a deep learning framework that supports the EfficientNet architecture, Adam optimizer, and cyclical learning rates. Both TensorFlow and PyTorch have implementations of the EfficientNet architecture and support for the Adam optimizer.

In addition, the model was trained within the Google Colaboratory 'Colab' platform, which is a web-based platform for running Jupyter notebooks and supports both TensorFlow and PyTorch. Therefore, it is highly likely that either TensorFlow or PyTorch was used to build the deep learning model.
