The provided context does not include information about the deep learning pipeline or data bias techniques used during preprocessing. The text focuses on a study about the vulnerability of lowland and upland orchids to climate change and land cover change, and lists the contributions of various authors in terms of tasks such as writing, validation, supervision, resources, investigation, data curation, project administration, and conceptualization.

However, I can provide some general techniques that are commonly used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline:

1. **Stratified sampling**: This technique involves dividing the dataset into strata based on certain characteristics, and then ensuring that each stratum is proportionally represented in the training, validation, and test sets. This can help ensure that the model is exposed to a diverse range of data points and reduces the risk of bias.
2. **Oversampling**: In cases where certain classes or categories are underrepresented in the dataset, oversampling can be used to increase the number of instances from these classes. This can help prevent the model from being biased towards the majority classes.
3. **Undersampling**: Conversely, if certain classes are overrepresented in the dataset, undersampling can be used to reduce the number of instances from these classes. This can help prevent the model from being overfit to the majority classes.
4. **Diverse data collection**: This involves collecting data from a wide range of sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population or problem space. This can help reduce the risk of bias and ensure that the model is exposed to a diverse range of data points.

It's important to note that the choice of technique will depend on the specific dataset and problem at hand. Careful consideration should be given to the potential biases in the dataset and appropriate techniques should be used to mitigate these biases during preprocessing.
