The deep learning model described in the context uses a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architecture with four layers, each containing 512 neurons. The layers are connected with residual connections and utilize batch normalization and the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function, except for the final layer which uses a sigmoid function for multi-label classification. The model is trained with a batch size of 256 for 30 epochs using the AdamW optimizer. Both the weight decay and learning rate are set to 0.0001. Additionally, a learning rate scheduler with exponential decay of 0.95 and dropout are employed.

Furthermore, the model's performance can be improved by setting different values for the hyperparameter λ2 for different species within the same region. Higher values of λ2 could be set for known generalist species, especially if there is a strong sampling bias.

The context also provides a table (Table B.4) that compares the mean AUC performance of other alternative ML loss functions, such as weighted Cross-Entropy (CE), Focal CE with different values of γ, LDAM with different values of C, DB loss with different values of λ, and Entmax with different values of α. These loss functions could be considered as alternative hyperparameters to improve the model's performance.

However, the context does not provide specific information on how these alternative loss functions were implemented or tuned in the model. Therefore, further investigation would be required to determine the optimal values for these loss functions.

In summary, the deep learning model uses a multi-layer perceptron architecture with residual connections, batch normalization, and the Rectified Linear Unit activation function. The model is trained using the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001 and a weight decay of 0.0001. The performance of the model can be improved by setting different values for the hyperparameter λ2 for different species and by considering alternative loss functions such as weighted Cross-Entropy, Focal CE, LDAM, DB loss, and Entmax.
