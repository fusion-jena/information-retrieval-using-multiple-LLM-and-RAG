The text provided does not give specific details about the data preprocessing techniques used to address data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it does mention that dataset imbalance was dealt with by including class weights in the cross-entropy loss function. This is a common technique used to handle class imbalance, where the loss function is adjusted to give more weight to the classes with fewer examples, so that the model pays more attention to those classes during training.

In addition, the text mentions that the learning curve of the models was studied in relation to the amount of training data. This can provide insights into whether the models are benefiting from additional training data and whether there is a risk of overfitting. However, it does not provide information on whether diverse data collection or other preprocessing techniques were used to address data bias.

Finally, the text mentions that the HuggingFace implementations of ViT and ResNet, as well as the Keras implementation of Inception-V3, were used for fine-tuning, and that all models had been pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. However, it does not provide information on whether the ImageNet dataset was curated to address data bias or whether other preprocessing techniques were used.

In summary, while the text provides some information on how dataset imbalance was handled during training, it does not provide specific details about other data preprocessing techniques used to address data bias during the deep learning pipeline.
