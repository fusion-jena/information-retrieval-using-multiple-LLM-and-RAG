The provided article does not specifically discuss the deep learning pipeline or data bias techniques used during its preprocessing. However, it does mention some techniques related to data preprocessing and bias reduction in the context of machine learning and ensemble predictions.

One such technique is the use of balanced weights during the RandomForest analysis (2.3.4). Balanced weights can help reduce bias when the classes are imbalanced, ensuring that each class is given equal importance during the training process.

Another technique mentioned is the 'bagging' method used in RandomForest, which is an ensemble learning technique that helps reduce overfitting and variance by combining multiple decision trees, each trained on a random subset of the data (Breiman, 2001). This method can help improve the robustness and generalizability of the model, reducing potential biases that may arise from relying on a single decision tree.

The article also discusses the use of various predictors, including socio-economic, geographic, and environmental factors (2.3.5, Table 3). By incorporating a diverse set of predictors, the model can capture a more comprehensive understanding of the problem, potentially reducing biases that may arise from relying on a limited set of features.

However, these techniques are not explicitly discussed in the context of deep learning or data bias reduction during preprocessing. For deep learning pipelines, techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection can be employed to address data bias.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the data into subsets while preserving the original class distribution, ensuring that each subset contains a representative sample of each class. Oversampling and undersampling techniques can help balance the class distribution by either duplicating instances from the minority class (oversampling) or removing instances from the majority class (undersampling). Diverse data collection focuses on gathering data from various sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the target population, reducing potential biases that may arise from limited data sources or underrepresentation.

In summary, while the provided article does not explicitly discuss data bias techniques during deep learning pipeline preprocessing, it does mention some related techniques in the context of machine learning and ensemble predictions, such as balanced weights, bagging, and diverse predictor sets. For deep learning pipelines, techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection can be employed to address data bias.
