The deep learning pipeline described in the text uses stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as the optimization technique for minimizing the cross-entropy loss. Specifically, mini-batch SGD is used, which involves processing the training data in small batches and updating the model parameters after each batch. This approach allows for more efficient computation and memory usage compared to processing the entire training dataset at once.

The learning rate for SGD is set to a constant value of 0.01. The learning rate is a hyperparameter that controls the step size of each parameter update during training. A learning rate that is too high may cause the model to converge too quickly to a suboptimal solution, while a learning rate that is too low may result in slow convergence.

In addition to SGD, other optimization techniques such as Adam or RMSprop could have been used in the deep learning pipeline. These methods are designed to adaptively adjust the learning rate during training, which can potentially lead to faster convergence and better model performance. However, the text does not provide information on whether these techniques were considered or compared to SGD.

Another optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline is dropout. Dropout is a regularization method that randomly sets a fraction of the input units to zero during training, which helps to prevent overfitting by reducing the co-adaptation of feature detectors. In this case, dropout is applied to the input of the last two layers with a probability of 0.5.

Finally, L2-regularization is applied to the weights of the last two layers with a penalty factor of 0.001. L2-regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the squared magnitude of the model weights. This helps to prevent overfitting by encouraging the model to learn smaller weight values, which can improve generalization performance.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline described in the text uses mini-batch SGD with a constant learning rate of 0.01, dropout regularization, and L2-regularization to optimize the cross-entropy loss for bird species classification from flight calls. Other optimization techniques such as Adam or RMSprop are not mentioned in the text.
