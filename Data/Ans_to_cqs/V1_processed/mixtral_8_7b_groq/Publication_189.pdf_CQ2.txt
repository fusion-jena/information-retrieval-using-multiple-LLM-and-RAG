The provided context includes information about the use of image data in deep learning pipelines. In the research conducted by Zhao and Ren (2020), the Region of Interest Extraction for Image Linear Distortion Correction was implemented using Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs). This research utilized image data as the input format for the deep learning pipeline.

In another study, a HOG-CNN Based Real Time Face Recognition system was developed (Ahamed, Alam, and Islam, 2018). This system also used image data as the input format for the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, the researchers used face images for training and testing their model.

Furthermore, the Computer Vision Annotation Tool (Sekachev, Zhavoronkov, and Manovich) is a universal approach to data annotation that can be used for various data formats, including images, audio, and video. However, the provided context does not include specific details about the use of audio or video data formats in this tool.

The IKKAKU Project (<https://ikkaku.lne.st/en/vision/>) is a computer vision system that can be used for various applications, including object detection and image recognition. While the provided context does not include specific details about the data formats used in this project, it is likely that image data is used as an input format for the deep learning pipeline.

In addition, the use of data augmentation techniques on fine-tuned CNN models (Poojary, Raina, and Mondal, 2020) implies the use of image data as an input format for the deep learning pipeline. Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, scaling, and flipping are commonly used for image data to increase the size of the training dataset and improve the model's performance.

Finally, the use of the LIBSVM library for support vector machines (Chang and Lin, 2011) does not provide specific details about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, this library can be used for various data formats, including image, audio, and text data.

In summary, the provided context suggests that image data is the most commonly used data format in deep learning pipelines. While other data formats such as audio and video may be used, the provided context does not include specific details about their use.
