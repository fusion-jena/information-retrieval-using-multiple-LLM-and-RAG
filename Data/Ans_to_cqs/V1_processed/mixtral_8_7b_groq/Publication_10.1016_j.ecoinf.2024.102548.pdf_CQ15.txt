The text provided discusses various aspects of a deep learning pipeline for diagnosing a specific medical condition (YVMV), but it does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used during training. However, based on common practices in deep learning, I will provide a probable answer.

In deep learning, optimizers are essential for minimizing the loss function and finding optimal model parameters. Some popular optimizers include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adagrad, Adadelta, and Adam.

Considering the context, it is highly likely that the deep learning pipeline utilizes the Adam optimizer. The reason for this assumption is that the pipeline involves transfer learning, where models are initialized with pre-trained weights from large-scale datasets like ImageNet. Adam is a widely-used optimizer in transfer learning scenarios due to its adaptive learning rate, which allows it to perform well even when dealing with different tasks and datasets.

Additionally, the pipeline uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) like LSTM and GRUs to capture sequential dependencies in the data. These RNNs can be trained using various optimizers, including Adam, which is a suitable choice for optimizing the parameters of RNNs.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it is highly probable that the pipeline utilizes the Adam optimizer due to its widespread use in transfer learning and RNN training scenarios.
