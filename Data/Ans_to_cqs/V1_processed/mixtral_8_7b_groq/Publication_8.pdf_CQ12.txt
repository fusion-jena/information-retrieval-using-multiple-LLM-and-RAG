The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is mentioned at the beginning of the first piece of context: "The most common type of deep learning network architecture being used for extracting image features is the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)". CNNs are well-suited to image processing tasks due to their ability to extract visual features from images using convolution operations. The specific CNN used in the pipeline is not specified, but it includes convolutional, non-linear, and pooling layers, and is trained using transfer learning with pre-trained weights from the ImageNet dataset. The trained model is then fine-tuned on an annotated herbarium scan dataset for the specific task of predicting plant organs.

In addition, the use of a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) is mentioned in the context. An FPN is a type of architecture that can be added to a CNN to improve the detection of objects at different scales. The illustration of an FPN in Figure 5 shows how feature maps at different levels of the network are combined to create a feature pyramid, allowing the network to detect objects at different scales. However, it is not explicitly stated whether an FPN is used in the pipeline or not.

It is also worth noting that the specific CNN architecture used in the pipeline is not specified, and there are many different CNN architectures that could be used for image processing tasks. Some examples include LeNet, AlexNet, VGG, GoogLeNet, ResNet, and DenseNet. The choice of CNN architecture may depend on factors such as the size and complexity of the dataset, the computational resources available, and the specific task at hand.

In summary, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and it is trained using transfer learning with pre-trained weights from the ImageNet dataset. The pipeline may also use a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) to improve object detection at different scales. However, the specific CNN architecture used in the pipeline is not specified.
