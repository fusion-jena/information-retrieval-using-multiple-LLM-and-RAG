The provided context does not include information about the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text focuses on presenting the results of a study that used deep learning to map the conservation status of orchid assemblages at a global scale. While it mentions the use of deep learning models and provides references to other studies that used similar approaches, it does not give details about the specific code repository or implementation. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository based on the given context.
