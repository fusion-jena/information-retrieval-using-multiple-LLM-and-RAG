The provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in this research. The text focuses on the importance of fish biomass estimation, the challenges in turbid environments, and the potential benefits of using deep learning techniques for this task. It discusses various aspects of deep learning model training, such as the number of epochs, learning rate, cosine learning rate, optimizer, and initial learning rate. However, there is no mention of where the code repository is located. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information.
