The provided context does not include information about the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in the study by Couttenier et al., 2022 and Elmes et al., 2020. The studies describe the development of deep learning models for detecting artisanal and small-scale mining (ASGM) using satellite imagery and Google Earth Engine (GEE), but there is no mention of a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline.

The study by Couttenier et al., 2022 uses a deep learning model based on a U-Net architecture to map ASGM at a large scale from space. The study by Elmes et al., 2020 uses a Sentinel-2 based multispectral convolutional neural network for detecting ASGM in Ghana. However, neither study provides a link to the code repository for their deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I am unable to provide the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline based on the given context.
