Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. However, the context does provide information about how the accuracy of a thematic map produced by a calibrated statistical prediction method was assessed.

In the context, it is mentioned that data availability is often limited, and therefore resampling methods are used to assess the accuracy of the final model. This is similar to the approach used in machine learning, where the full dataset is divided into a training set, a validation set, and a test set. However, in this case, the test set is not set aside, and resampling methods are used instead.

One possible process for deploying a trained deep learning model, given the information in the context, would be to use resampling methods to assess the accuracy of the final model. This could involve using techniques such as cross-validation, where the data is divided into multiple folds, and the model is trained and tested on different subsets of the data. This can help to provide a more robust estimate of the model's performance, as it allows for the evaluation of the model on different subsets of the data.

Once the accuracy of the model has been assessed, the next step would be to serialize the model so that it can be deployed on a platform. Model serialization involves saving the model's architecture and weights so that it can be loaded and used for making predictions on new data. There are many different formats for serializing deep learning models, such as HDF5, JSON, and YAML, and the choice of format will depend on the platform on which the model will be deployed.

After the model has been serialized, it can be deployed on a platform for making predictions. There are many different platforms that can be used for deploying deep learning models, such as cloud-based platforms, edge devices, and embedded systems. The choice of platform will depend on the specific requirements of the application, such as the need for low latency, high throughput, or scalability.

In summary, while there is no explicit information given in the context about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model, it is mentioned that resampling methods are used to assess the accuracy of the final model. Based on this information, one possible process for deploying a trained deep learning model would be to use resampling methods to assess the accuracy of the model, serialize the model, and then deploy it on a platform for making predictions.
