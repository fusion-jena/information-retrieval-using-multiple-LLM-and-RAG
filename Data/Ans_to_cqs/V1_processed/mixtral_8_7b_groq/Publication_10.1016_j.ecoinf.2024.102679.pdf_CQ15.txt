The provided context does not give specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The text mentions the use of deep learning for wildlife population estimation and biodiversity monitoring, but it does not specify which optimization algorithms were applied during the training of the deep learning models.

Optimization techniques, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), and others, are essential components of deep learning pipelines. These algorithms help minimize the loss function and find the optimal set of weights and biases for the neural network.

Without more information from the sources mentioned in the context, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to this query. However, it is reasonable to assume that some optimization technique was used during the deep learning training process, considering it is a standard practice in the field.

An optimization technique might have been chosen based on the specific requirements of the problem, such as the size and complexity of the dataset, the computational resources available, and the desired convergence speed. The choice of optimization technique can significantly impact the performance and efficiency of the deep learning model.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it is likely that an optimization algorithm was employed to train the deep learning models for wildlife population estimation and biodiversity monitoring.
