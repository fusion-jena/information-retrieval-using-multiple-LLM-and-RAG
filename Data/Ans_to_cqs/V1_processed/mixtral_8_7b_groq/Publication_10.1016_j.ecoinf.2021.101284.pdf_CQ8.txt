The provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text focuses on the use of a Maximum Entropy-based Ecological Niche Model (ME-ENM) to determine a risk index for COVID-19 infection rate increase, but it does not mention the code repository or the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
