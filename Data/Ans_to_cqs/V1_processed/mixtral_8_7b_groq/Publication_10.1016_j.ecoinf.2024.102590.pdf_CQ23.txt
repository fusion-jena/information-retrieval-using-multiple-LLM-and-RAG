The text provided does not give specific details about the use of a deep learning model in the study. However, it does mention some measures that were taken to ensure the quality and representativeness of the training and validation data used in a Landsat 8 data classification study. These measures could potentially contribute to the generalizability of a deep learning model if one were used.

Firstly, the sampling plots for data collection were placed within vegetation types described by Gertenbach (1983), rather than randomly over the entire boundary. This ensured that the training and validation points were representative of the diverse vegetation within each boundary. The creation of several small sampling plots within each vegetation type also helped speed up the sampling process and increased the likelihood of capturing the variability within each vegetation type.

Secondly, the size of the sampling plots was determined by calculating 5% of the total area covered by the boundary and dividing that area by the number of vegetation types intersecting the boundary. This approach ensured that the sampling plots were of a consistent size and that they were distributed across the different vegetation types.

Thirdly, the statistics table provides information on the overall accuracy, producer’s accuracy, and user’s accuracy for each photojob. These metrics provide insights into the performance of the classification model and could be used to assess its generalizability.

Finally, the study results can be used as a baseline for future LULC analysis performed with other methodologies, such as deep learning CNN. This suggests that the authors consider the results of their study to be robust and applicable to other contexts.

In summary, while the text does not explicitly mention the use of measures such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting for a deep learning model, it does describe measures that were taken to ensure the quality and representativeness of the training and validation data. These measures could contribute to the generalizability of a deep learning model if one were used.
