I regret to inform you that there is no code repository link provided in the given pieces of context regarding the deep learning pipeline used for canopy height model or forest aboveground biomass estimation. The research papers mention the use of Google Earth Engine, machine learning, and deep learning techniques but do not share the code or repository details.

For reference, Tamiminia et al. (2021) and Tamiminia et al. (2021a) compare machine and deep learning methods for shrub willow biomass and forest above-ground biomass estimation, respectively. Ma et al. (2019) provide a meta-analysis and review of deep learning in remote sensing applications. However, none of these papers share their code or repository.

If you are interested in the specific deep learning techniques used in these studies, I would recommend reaching out to the authors directly for more information. They may be willing to share their code or provide further insights into their methods.
