The process of deploying the trained deep learning model involves several steps, although the specifics of model serialization and platform selection are not provided in the given context. However, we can infer the general process based on the information available.

First, the model is trained and validated using a combination of datasets and evaluation methods. This includes data collection, preprocessing, and augmentation, followed by training the model using a supervised approach. The model's performance is then evaluated using a separate testing dataset, and it undergoes three phases of testing: i) checking for overfitting, ii) comparing the model's performance with other state-of-the-art methods, and iii) having field experts evaluate the model using a completely new dataset independent from the first and second datasets.

Once the model has successfully passed these three phases, it can be considered for deployment. The context suggests that the deep learning model will be integrated with camera systems used in aeroplanes and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for real-time rescue missions on high seas and open oceans, specifically after aeroplane crashes and maritime accidents to find wreckages and survivals. However, the specifics of model serialization and platform selection are not mentioned.

Model serialization typically involves saving the trained model's architecture, weights, and other relevant information in a file format that can be easily loaded and used for making predictions on new data. Common model serialization formats include HDF5, JSON, XML, and protocol buffers.

Platform selection involves choosing the appropriate hardware and software environment for deploying the model. This could include edge devices, cloud servers, or a combination of both. The choice of platform depends on various factors such as the model's size, computational requirements, latency constraints, and the availability of resources.

In summary, while the specifics of model serialization and platform selection are not provided in the given context, we can infer that the deep learning model undergoes rigorous testing and evaluation before deployment. The model is intended to be integrated with camera systems in aeroplanes and UAVs for real-time rescue missions, and the choice of model serialization format and platform will depend on various factors such as the model's size, computational requirements, and available resources.
