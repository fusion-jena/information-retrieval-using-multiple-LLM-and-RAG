In the context provided, while there is no explicit list of preprocessing steps for training a deep learning model, we can infer some possible steps based on the given information.

1. **Image Orientation and Alignment**: Given the emphasis on camera orientation to the subject and the use of calibrated cameras, it's likely that one preprocessing step would be to ensure all images are aligned in a consistent manner. This could involve rotating images so that they are upright or have a consistent angle relative to the subject of interest.

2. **Illumination Correction**: The context mentions different types of illumination (sunlight, artificial light, mixed light), which could affect the training of a deep learning model. Preprocessing might include correcting for different illumination conditions to ensure consistency across the dataset.

3. **Scaling and Normalization**: These are common preprocessing steps in deep learning. Scaling could involve adjusting the pixel values to a similar range, while normalization often involves transforming the data so that it has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This can help the model converge during training.

4. **Cleaning**: This could involve removing images that are not useful for the model, such as those that are out of focus, have significant motion blur, or do not contain the subject of interest.

5. **Data Augmentation**: Although not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, data augmentation is a common preprocessing step for deep learning. This could involve flipping, rotating, or zooming in/out on images to artificially increase the size of the dataset and help the model generalize better.

6. **Ancillary Data Integration**: If there are other types of data being captured alongside the images (like GPS coordinates or depth), these might need to be preprocessed and integrated with the images before training the model.

7. **Metadata Incorporation**: The context also mentions various metadata fields. Some of this information might be useful as additional channels or inputs to the deep learning model.

Remember, the specific preprocessing steps can vary depending on the specific task, dataset, and model being used.
