Based on the information provided, there is no explicit mention of how the hyperparameters of the MaxEnt model were optimized. Hyperparameters are parameters whose values are set before the learning process begins and are not learned from the data. Common methods for hyperparameter optimization include grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization.

In the given context, the focus is on the analysis of the MaxEnt model's output, specifically the relative contributions of environmental and territorial variables. The table shows the average of 10 replicate runs, with each run using a subsample of the data and a 30% random test percentage. The percent contribution and permutation importance of temperature factors, precipitation factors, and geographical factors are presented for Quercus pubescens Willd. and Quercus ilex subsp. ilex.

However, the process of selecting the hyperparameters of the MaxEnt model, such as the regularization value or the maximum number of iterations, is not discussed. Therefore, it is not possible to provide an answer to this query without additional information.
