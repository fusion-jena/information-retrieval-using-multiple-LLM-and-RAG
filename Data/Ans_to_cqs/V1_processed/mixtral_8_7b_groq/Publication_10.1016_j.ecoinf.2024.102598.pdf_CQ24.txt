While the provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, it does offer some insights into how randomness is managed in related machine learning models.

In the context of Random Forest, a specific number of trees (500) was set as an additional parameter. This is a way to manage randomness because it determines the number of times a random subset of features is selected for splitting at each node. By setting a fixed number of trees, the model's variability due to this randomness is reduced.

Additionally, the use of 10-fold cross-validation (CV) in the model validation process also helps manage randomness. In CV, the data is divided into k folds (in this case, k=10), and the model is trained and tested k times, each time with a different fold held out as a validation set. This means that each data point is used for validation exactly once, and the final performance of the model is an average of the performance across all k runs. This averaging process helps to reduce the impact of randomness on the model's performance.

However, the provided context does not mention any specific strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Deep learning models, like neural networks, often have more sources of randomness than Random Forest, such as the initialization of weights and biases, the order of training examples, and the use of dropout regularization.

To handle these sources of randomness, deep learning practitioners often use techniques such as setting a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility, using techniques like batch normalization to reduce the impact of weight initialization, and using techniques like early stopping to prevent overfitting due to the order of training examples.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does offer insights into how randomness is managed in related machine learning models. Deep learning practitioners use a variety of techniques to manage randomness, such as setting a fixed random seed value, using batch normalization, and using early stopping.
