The context provided does not give specific details on the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the target model or the attack model. However, it does mention that hyper-parameters are validated using a validation set during the training process of the target model. In many machine learning models, training is often considered complete when the validation loss plateaus or stops decreasing significantly, indicating that the model has learned enough from the training data to generalize well to unseen data. This process could potentially be applied to the target model in this context, but it is not explicitly stated. As for the attack model, the context only mentions that it is trained using an attack training dataset and the learning algorithm A, without specifying the training completion criteria. Therefore, while it is likely that a similar validation-based approach is used, the specific criteria are not provided in the context.
