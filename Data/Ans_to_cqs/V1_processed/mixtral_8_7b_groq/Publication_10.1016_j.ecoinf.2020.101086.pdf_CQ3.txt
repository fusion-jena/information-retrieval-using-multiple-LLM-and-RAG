The provided context does not contain information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context focuses on a study that proposes a new method for correcting the effect of sampling bias in species distribution modeling when the number of presence sites is low. The method, proposed by Moua et al. (2017), is based on the estimation of the sampling effort within the environmental space using a Gaussian-like membership function.

The study area's pixels are represented in the environmental variable space using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), or Factor Analysis of Mixed Data (FAMD) depending on the data type. The sampling effort associated with a given pixel corresponds to the ratio of the number of sampled pixels over the total number of pixels within the environmental neighborhood of the pixel.

Therefore, the context does not provide information on data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines.
