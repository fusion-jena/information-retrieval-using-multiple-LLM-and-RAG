The provided context does not specify the exact deep learning model used in the study, so I cannot give you the exact hyperparameters that were used. However, I can tell you that common hyperparameters for deep learning models include:

1. Learning rate: This controls how quickly the model learns from the data. A learning rate that is too high may cause the model to converge too quickly to a suboptimal solution, while a learning rate that is too low may cause the model to learn too slowly.
2. Optimizer: This is the algorithm used to update the model's weights and biases based on the gradient of the loss function. Common optimizers include stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop.
3. Number of layers and number of neurons per layer: These determine the complexity of the model. A model with more layers and more neurons per layer will be more complex and may be able to learn more complex patterns in the data, but it will also be more prone to overfitting.
4. Regularization parameters: These are used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. Common regularization techniques include L1 and L2 regularization.
5. Batch size: This is the number of samples used in each update of the model's weights and biases. A larger batch size will result in more stable updates but may require more memory, while a smaller batch size will result in noisier updates but may be more memory-efficient.
6. Number of epochs: This is the number of times the model sees the entire training dataset. A larger number of epochs will result in a model that has seen the data more times, but it may also result in overfitting if the model is not regularized properly.

It's important to note that the choice of hyperparameters depends on the specific deep learning model and the dataset being used. Therefore, it's common to use techniques such as grid search or random search to find the best set of hyperparameters for a given problem.
