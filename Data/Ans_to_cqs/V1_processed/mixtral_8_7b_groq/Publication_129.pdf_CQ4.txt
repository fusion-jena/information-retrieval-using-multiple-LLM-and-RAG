The provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses the use of the Faster R-CNN model for agricultural pest recognition, which can be implemented with data augmentation techniques to improve model performance.

Common data augmentation techniques for computer vision tasks include flipping, rotating, and scaling. Flipping involves creating new images by horizontally or vertically flipping the original images. Rotating involves rotating the original images by a certain angle. Scaling involves changing the size of the original images. These techniques can increase the size of the training dataset, reduce overfitting, and improve the model's ability to generalize.

In the context of the Faster R-CNN model, data augmentation techniques can be applied during the training process. For example, during the Region Proposal Network (RPN) stage, the input images can be augmented by flipping, rotating, and scaling to generate more region proposals. During the RoI pooling layer, the augmented regions can be divided into sub-windows, and the maximum pooling can be performed to give the output of the RoI pooling layer. After passing through two fully connected layers, the features can be fed into the classifier and regressor branches.

In the study mentioned in the context, the authors used the IP102 dataset, which contains images of five crop pest classes. They achieved a high accuracy score of 98.8% using the Faster R-CNN model. However, they did not mention whether they used data augmentation techniques in their implementation.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it is common practice to use flipping, rotating, and scaling techniques to improve model performance.
