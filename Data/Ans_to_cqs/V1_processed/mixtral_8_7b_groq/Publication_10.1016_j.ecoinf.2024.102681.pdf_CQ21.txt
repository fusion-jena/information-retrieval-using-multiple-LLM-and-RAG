Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps applied after the model training process. However, it can be inferred that metrics calculation was performed since the text mentions an improvement in the model's prediction accuracy by about 20% after embedding an LSTM into the CNN.

The context also mentions the use of a CNN-LSTM (C-L) hybrid model, which implies that feature extraction and convolution were carried out as part of the model training process. Additionally, the LSTM network was employed to capture time dependency and model the interplay between drought propagation times and eight influencing factors.

However, the context does not mention any postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrix calculations. Saliency maps are often used to visualize the importance of input features in the prediction made by a model, while a confusion matrix is a table used to describe the performance of a classification model.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we can only confirm that metrics calculation was performed after the model training process. The other postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrix calculations are not mentioned in the context.
