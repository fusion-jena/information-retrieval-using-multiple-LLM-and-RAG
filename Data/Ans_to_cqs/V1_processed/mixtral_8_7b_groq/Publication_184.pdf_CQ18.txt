The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of evaluation indices such as recall and precision. Recall is calculated as the true positives (TP) divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives (FN), while precision is calculated as the true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false positives (FP). These indices are used to assess the performance of the model in detecting fish objects within the images.

Additionally, the training process is divided into two phases: the training phase and the testing phase. During the training phase, the model's performance is evaluated after each epoch by calculating the recall and precision of the detected fish objects. This allows for the monitoring of the model's performance over time and the identification of any trends or issues that may arise.

Furthermore, the training data is augmented to increase the amount of data available for training. This is done by parsing the x, y coordinates, width, and height of the fish in the image annotations and using this information to generate new training samples. This data augmentation strategy helps to prevent overfitting of the model to the training data and ensures that the model is able to generalize well to new, unseen data.

The model's performance is also monitored by observing the loss function over time. As the model is trained, the loss function is expected to decrease, indicating that the model is improving. In this case, the loss function showed a rapid decline around 1000 iterations, indicating that the model was improving swiftly during this time.

Finally, the model's performance is evaluated using the mean average precision (mAP) metric, which takes into account both the precision and recall of the model. This metric is calculated based on the ground truth bounding boxes (GT bboxes) and the predicted bounding boxes plus the confidence scores. This allows for a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance in detecting fish objects within the images.

In summary, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of recall and precision indices, data augmentation, observation of the loss function, and evaluation using the mAP metric. These strategies allow for the effective monitoring of the model's performance and the identification of any issues that may arise during training.
