Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the use of satellite images and in-situ measured data for mapping turbidity, chlorophyll-a, and cyanobacteria in water bodies using various methods such as Landsat, random forest, and three-band model. However, it does not mention any deep learning pipeline or the data repository for it. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
