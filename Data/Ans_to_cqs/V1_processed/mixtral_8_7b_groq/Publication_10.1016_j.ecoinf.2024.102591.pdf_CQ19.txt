The provided context does not specify which framework was used to build the deep learning model for wildfire science. However, it is mentioned that Google Earth Engine (GEE) provides a platform for high-performance computing and hosts a vast remote sensing data catalog, which can be processed using automatic parallel processing and advanced image processing techniques. The GEE platform supports JavaScript, Python, and R application programming interfaces (APIs), which can be used to build and implement machine learning algorithms.

Deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch are widely used in remote sensing and wildfire science. TensorFlow is an open-source platform for machine learning and artificial intelligence, developed by Google Brain Team. It provides a comprehensive ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML-powered applications. PyTorch, developed by Facebook's AI Research lab, is another popular open-source machine learning library based on the Torch library. It is used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention which deep learning framework was used, it is likely that one of these popular frameworks, TensorFlow or PyTorch, was used to build the deep learning model for wildfire science, implemented on the Google Earth Engine platform.
