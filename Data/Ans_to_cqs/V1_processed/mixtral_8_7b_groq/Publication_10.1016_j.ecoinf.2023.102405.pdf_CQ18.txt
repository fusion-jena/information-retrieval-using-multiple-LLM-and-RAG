The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves tracking the training loss and accuracy for each epoch. Specifically, at the beginning of each epoch, the total loss and total correct predictions are initialized to zero. Then, as the model processes each mini-batch of input data, the loss between the predicted labels and the true labels is calculated and added to the total loss. Additionally, the number of correct predictions is also updated. Once all mini-batches have been processed, the average training loss and accuracy for that epoch are calculated and stored.

This approach allows for a systematic evaluation of how well the model is learning over time. By monitoring the training loss, it is possible to determine if the model is overfitting or underfitting the data. If the training loss is consistently high, it may indicate that the model is underfitting and needs to be adjusted. Conversely, if the training loss is very low but the validation loss is much higher, it may indicate that the model is overfitting and needs to be regularized.

Furthermore, the attention mechanism in the AODEGRU model provides additional insights into the model's behavior. By calculating the attention scores for each input feature, it is possible to identify which features the model is focusing on the most. This information can be used to better understand the relationships between the input features and the target labels, and to identify any potential issues with the data or the model.

Overall, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves tracking the training loss and accuracy for each epoch, as well as calculating the attention scores for each input feature. This approach allows for a comprehensive evaluation of the model's behavior and performance, enabling researchers to identify and address any issues that may arise during training.
