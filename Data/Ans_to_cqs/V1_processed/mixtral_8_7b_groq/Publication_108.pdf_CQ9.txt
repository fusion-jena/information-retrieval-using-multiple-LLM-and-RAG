The provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The text describes a case study that uses high-resolution orthophotos with 20-cm spatial resolution obtained from an aerial survey to train a deep learning model for a specific task. However, it does not mention where the data or the code for the deep learning pipeline are available. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query. If the data repository is available on platforms such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF, it would be helpful if the authors of the study provided this information in their paper or in their correspondence.
