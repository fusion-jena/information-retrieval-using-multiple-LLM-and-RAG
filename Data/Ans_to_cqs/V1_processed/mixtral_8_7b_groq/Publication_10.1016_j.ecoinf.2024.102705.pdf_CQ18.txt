The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of Average Precision (AP) as the primary performance metric. AP calculates the area under the precision-recall curve at different thresholds, represented as P (precision) and R (recall). This metric is commonly used for evaluating model performance.

During the training process, the YOLOv3 model was used as the baseline for all experiments, and the AIP-OD model was trained using the Adam optimizer. The training process consisted of 150 epochs with a batch size of 4, which was gradually decreased to 4. The learning rate started at 10-3 over the course of training.

To expand the training dataset, various data augmentation techniques were employed, including random adjustments to image size, image flipping, cropping, and conversion. These techniques helped ensure that the model was exposed to a diverse range of inputs, thereby improving its ability to generalize and monitor performance.

The training process was executed on a GTX2080Ti GPU using Tensorflow 1.14. The experiments conducted in this study involved the DIP module, which was used for monitoring the model's performance during training.

The DIP module summarizes the ecological environment in test datasets, providing the number and frequency of each species in all environmental types. For instance, in the case of conifer forests, the DIP module reports the number of cougars and black bears observed. Similarly, for deciduous forests, the module reports the number of cougars, black bears, bobcats, wild boars, coyotes, raccoons, wild turkeys, jackrabbits, quails, red squirrels, red foxes, opossums, and martens observed.

By monitoring the model's performance using the DIP module and evaluating it using the Average Precision metric, the study was able to ensure that the image processing results contributed to improved performance of the deep learning model. This strategy enabled expedited transitions from field surveys to reporting, even in challenging circumstances, thereby facilitating efficient data collection and analysis on a larger scale.
