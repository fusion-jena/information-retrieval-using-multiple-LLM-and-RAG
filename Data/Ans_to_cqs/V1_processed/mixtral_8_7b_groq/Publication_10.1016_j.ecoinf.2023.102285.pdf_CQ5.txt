Based on the provided references, there is no specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipelines for underwater man-made object detection or marine bird community surveys. However, it can be inferred that these studies might have used their own proprietary or specific datasets for training and testing their deep learning models.

In the context of underwater man-made object detection, Han et al. (2022) proposed a deep learning technique for detecting, classifying, and locating vessels and oil platforms based on remote optical imagery. Although the reference does not explicitly mention the dataset used, it can be inferred that the authors might have used a dataset of remote optical images of marine environments containing vessels and oil platforms for training and testing their deep learning model.

Similarly, in the context of marine bird community surveys, Clements and Robinson (2022) conducted a re-survey of winter bird communities in the Oregon coast range, USA, initially surveyed in 1968-1970. Although the reference does not explicitly mention the use of deep learning techniques, it can be inferred that the authors might have used machine learning or deep learning techniques for analyzing the bird survey data. However, the reference does not provide information on the dataset used for training and testing the machine learning or deep learning models.

Therefore, it can be concluded that the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipelines for underwater man-made object detection or marine bird community surveys are not provided in the given references. However, it can be inferred that the authors might have used their own proprietary or specific datasets for training and testing their deep learning models.
