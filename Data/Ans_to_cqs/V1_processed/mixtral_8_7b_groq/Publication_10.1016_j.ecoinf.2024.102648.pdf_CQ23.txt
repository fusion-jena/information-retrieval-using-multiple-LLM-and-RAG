Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that several measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, specifically the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model.

Firstly, the model was developed using a diverse and extensive dataset. The dataset used for the analysis included multiyear multilocation data, which suggests that the data used for training the model came from various sources and locations over multiple years. This approach helps to improve the model's ability to generalize and perform well in different contexts.

Secondly, the model was compared with other statistical and machine learning models, including multiple linear regression, bootstrap forest, and boosted tree models. Comparing the performance of the ANN model with other models helps to ensure that the model's performance is not due to chance or overfitting.

Thirdly, the ANN model was analyzed using growing degree days (GDD) data. GDD is a measure of heat accumulation used in agriculture and horticulture to predict plant development rates. By analyzing the model using GDD data, the dependency on other data, such as relative humidity and rainfall, was reduced, which helped to improve the model's generalizability.

Lastly, the model was tested and validated using different activation functions and testing and training data sets. Testing and validating the model using different data sets and activation functions helps to ensure that the model's performance is not specific to a particular data set or activation function.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be concluded that several measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, including using a diverse dataset, comparing the model with other models, analyzing the model using GDD data, and testing and validating the model using different data sets and activation functions.
