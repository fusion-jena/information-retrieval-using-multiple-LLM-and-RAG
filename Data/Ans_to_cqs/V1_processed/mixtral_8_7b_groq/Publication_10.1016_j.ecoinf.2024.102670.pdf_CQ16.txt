The provided context does not contain information about the specific criteria used to determine when training of a machine learning or image processing model is complete. The text focuses on the validation of mycelium detection and separation of filaments in microscopy images, and does not mention training or evaluation metrics for model training.

In general, there are several common criteria used to determine when training of a machine learning model is complete, such as:

1. Validation loss plateau: Training can be considered complete when the validation loss stops decreasing or starts increasing, indicating that the model has learned the underlying patterns in the training data and is not overfitting.
2. Early stopping: Training can be stopped before the validation loss plateaus if the validation loss starts increasing, preventing overfitting.
3. Patience: Training can be stopped if the validation loss does not improve for a certain number of epochs or iterations.
4. Learning rate decay: Training can be stopped when the learning rate is decreased to a certain value, indicating that the model has reached a stable minimum.
5. Model performance: Training can be stopped when the model achieves a desired level of performance on a validation set or a test set.

These criteria can be used in combination to determine when training is complete. However, the provided context does not mention any of these criteria.
