The context provided does not give information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the use of artificial neural networks (ANN) and a hybrid model combining wavelet analysis and the NARX ANN algorithm for predicting vegetation biomass density. The ANN model consists of input, hidden, and output layers, and the number of neurons in the hidden layer was optimized. The training values and estimated percentages for Iznik and Alanya are mentioned, but there is no information about the hardware resources used for training the model.
