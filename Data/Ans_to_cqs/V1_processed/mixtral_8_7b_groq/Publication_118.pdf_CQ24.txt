The provided context discusses the use of a deep learning model, specifically an auto-encoder, for ecoacoustic analysis. However, it does not explicitly mention any strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value.

In general, deep learning models have several sources of randomness, including the initialization of model weights, the order of training samples, and the dropout regularization technique. To ensure reproducibility of results, it is common practice to set a random seed value to control these sources of randomness.

In the context of the provided document, the authors mention using PyTorch for their deep learning implementation. PyTorch provides a function called `torch.manual_seed()` to set the random seed value for reproducibility. Although the document does not explicitly mention the use of this function, it is a standard practice that responsible researchers may employ.

Furthermore, the authors mention using max-pooling and max-unpooling layers in their auto-encoder architecture. These layers may introduce randomness due to their implicit pooling determination. However, the document does not provide enough information to determine whether any strategies are used to handle this randomness.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention any strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it is a common practice to set a random seed value in deep learning implementations. The authors' use of PyTorch suggests that they may have employed this practice. However, without further information, it is impossible to determine whether any strategies were used to handle randomness introduced by max-pooling and max-unpooling layers.
