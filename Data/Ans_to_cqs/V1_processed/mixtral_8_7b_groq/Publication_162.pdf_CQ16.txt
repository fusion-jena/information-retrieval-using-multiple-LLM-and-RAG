The provided context does not give specific criteria for determining when training is complete in the context of the long-term wildlife classification project. However, it does mention some evaluation metrics for the object detection and segmentation tasks, such as AP50, AP75, and AP, which are calculated based on the intersection over union (IoU) threshold. These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the system on a retained test set of manually annotated images.

In addition, the project aims to apply and improve lifelong learning algorithms for the identification of wildlife animal species. Lifelong learning is a process that enables updates of the classification models once new data is available. This suggests that the training of the system is not a one-time event, but rather a continuous process that occurs as new data is collected over the long-term operation of the AMMOD stations.

Furthermore, the system uses active learning, which involves the user in the optimization of the system by forwarding images to humans for annotation at certain intervals. These annotated images are then used to train a classifier iteratively. This feedback mechanism allows the system to improve its performance over time by exploiting the data that is recorded during operation.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the training of the system is not complete in the traditional sense, but rather it is an ongoing process that is continuously updated and improved as new data becomes available. The system uses evaluation metrics such as AP50, AP75, and AP to assess the performance of the system, and active learning to improve the system's performance over time.

In summary, the provided context does not give specific criteria for determining when training is complete, but it suggests that the training of the system is an ongoing process that is continuously updated and improved as new data becomes available through the use of evaluation metrics and active learning.
