The provided context does not give specific information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline for the coral reef classification problem. However, it is mentioned that the deep neural network is fine-tuned using the Benthoz15 dataset, which consists of expert-annotated and geo-referenced marine images from Australian seas. It can be inferred that the deep learning pipeline could have used regularization techniques such as dropout, L2 regularization, or others to prevent overfitting, as these are common methods used in deep learning. Dropout involves randomly setting a fraction of the input units to zero during training, which helps in preventing over-dependence on individual neurons and thus reducing overfitting. L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, which is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This encourages smaller weights, reducing the complexity of the model and preventing overfitting. However, the specific regularization methods used in this study are not mentioned in the provided context.
