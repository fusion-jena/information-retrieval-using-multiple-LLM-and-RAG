The provided context discusses a study that used pre-trained ResNet152V2 model for audio classification, with a focus on the methodology and results of the study. However, it does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps applied to the audio data before training the deep learning model.

However, based on common practices in deep learning and the tools mentioned in the context, we can infer some preprocessing steps that were likely applied to the audio data.

Firstly, the audio data was pre-processed using Python 3 and the Librosa library was used to generate spectrograms. Spectrograms are a common preprocessing step for audio data in deep learning models. They represent the time-varying frequency content of a signal, and are used as input features for the deep learning model.

Secondly, normalization or scaling of the input features is a common preprocessing step in deep learning. Although not explicitly mentioned, it is likely that the spectrograms were normalized or scaled before being fed into the deep learning model. This is done to ensure that all input features are on a similar scale, which can help the model converge faster and improve its performance.

Thirdly, data cleaning is an important preprocessing step in any machine learning task. Although not explicitly mentioned, it is likely that the audio data was cleaned before being used in the study. This could involve removing any silent or corrupted segments from the audio data.

In summary, based on common practices in deep learning and the tools mentioned in the context, it is likely that the audio data was preprocessed using spectrograms, normalization or scaling, and data cleaning before being fed into the deep learning model. However, the context does not provide explicit details on these preprocessing steps.
