Unfortunately, the provided context does not include a direct link to the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. Commercial restrictions apply to the availability of data used in this work, which might be the reason why the code repository is not publicly shared. However, the documentation for the entire machine learning pipeline can be found at the following links: PyTorch (<https://pytorch.org/>) for PyTorch, scikit-learn (<https://scikit-learn.org/>) for scikit-learn, and skorch (<https://skorch.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>) for skorch. These resources should provide useful information on how to implement the deep learning pipeline. Additionally, the paper includes detailed descriptions of the steps required for data management and feature extraction, which can help guide users in implementing the pipeline.
