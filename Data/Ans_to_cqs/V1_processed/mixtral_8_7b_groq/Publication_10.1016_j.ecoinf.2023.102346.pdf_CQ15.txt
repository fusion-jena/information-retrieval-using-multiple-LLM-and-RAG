Based on the provided context, the text does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of machine learning algorithms such as Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), Random Forest (RF), Flexible Discriminant Analysis (FDA), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Generalized Boosting regression Model (GBM) and Maximum-Entropy learning (MAXENT) for habitat suitability prediction.

These algorithms are not considered deep learning algorithms, but rather traditional machine learning algorithms. Deep learning algorithms, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, typically require optimization techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad to update the weights during training.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.


The provided context does not mention any specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It mainly focuses on traditional machine learning algorithms and their application in habitat suitability prediction. Deep learning algorithms, which typically require optimization techniques for weight updates during training, are not mentioned. Therefore, the answer to the query is not available based on the given context.
