The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that deep learning models, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have been used for pattern recognition in insect images. Therefore, it can be inferred that the raw data used in these studies likely consists of images of insects.

There are various ways to collect such image data, including surveys, sensors, and public datasets. Surveys could involve manual collection of images by researchers or volunteers in the field. Sensors, on the other hand, could refer to automated cameras or drones that capture images of insects in their natural habitat. Public datasets, such as those provided by institutions or organizations, could also be a valuable source of image data for deep learning models.

For instance, in the context provided, the authors trained five different versions of the YOLOv5 model family to detect alates on sorghum leaves. It can be assumed that the raw data used in this study consisted of images of sorghum leaves with and without alates. The images were likely collected through a combination of surveys, sensors, and public datasets.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that image data is used in deep learning models for pattern recognition in insect images. Such image data can be collected through surveys, sensors, and public datasets.
