Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about postprocessing steps involving Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix after model training. The study focuses on proposing an end-to-end solution for the automated analysis of key features in filamentous organisms, such as filament length and network topology.

However, the context does mention some postprocessing steps related to the analysis of the filamentous organism Rhizophagus irregularis. These steps include:

1. Identifying the passage points attached to the filament.
2. Creating a straight line between these pairs of passage points.
3. Identifying branches connected to the Central Branching Point (CBP).
4. Removing the part of the encircling that does not represent the shortest geodesic path between a Branching Point (BP) and the CBP.

Additionally, the context mentions adjacent applications that will be developed in future studies, including:

1. Computing branching angles.
2. Computing line density.

Therefore, while the provided context does not directly answer the query regarding Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix, it does provide insight into the postprocessing steps taken to analyze and process the filamentous organism data.
