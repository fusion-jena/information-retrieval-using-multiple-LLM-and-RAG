Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling that were applied in the described deep learning pipeline. Data augmentation is a common technique used to increase the diversity of training data and improve model performance, especially when dealing with limited datasets. It involves creating modified versions of the original images by applying various transformations.

However, the text does mention that the study uses multi-temporal data from three different months (March, September, and October 2015) and three different environments. This approach can be seen as a form of implicit data augmentation since it increases the variety of data by including images from different time periods and environments.

The researchers also employed transfer learning using a pre-trained ResNet-34 architecture, which was initially trained on a large dataset called ImageNet. This technique can help improve model performance even without explicitly applying data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling.

In summary, while the text does not explicitly mention specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling, it does describe the use of multi-temporal data and transfer learning, which can be seen as forms of implicit data augmentation.
