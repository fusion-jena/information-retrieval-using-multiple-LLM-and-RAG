The specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the study involved a comparison of deep learning approaches with traditional machine learning methods, and the development of a new CNN-based model called SeedNet for single seed classification and retrieval.

The datasets used in the study are referred to as the "Canadian" and "local" retrieval datasets. The Canadian dataset is mentioned to have 6 class labels, while the local retrieval dataset has 23 class labels. These datasets are likely specific to the study and not publicly available, as they are not referred to by their standard names such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.

It is also mentioned that SeedNet was tested on these datasets and obtained outstanding performance results with low training times. Other CNNs such as Residual Networks (ResNet18) and SqueezeNet were also tested and obtained satisfactory results.

Therefore, while the specific datasets used in the study are not identified, it is clear that the study involved the use of custom datasets for seed classification and retrieval.
