The provided context does not contain specific information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of deep learning in various studies and the importance of high-quality data in machine learning, computer vision, and artificial intelligence.

In general, data augmentation techniques are commonly used in deep learning to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset, improve model performance, and prevent overfitting. Some of the most popular data augmentation techniques include:

1. Flipping: This involves horizontally flipping the images in the dataset, which can help the model learn rotation and direction invariance.
2. Rotating: This involves rotating the images in the dataset by a certain angle, which can help the model learn to recognize objects in different orientations.
3. Scaling: This involves resizing the images in the dataset by a certain scale factor, which can help the model learn to recognize objects of different sizes.
4. Translation: This involves shifting the images in the dataset horizontally or vertically, which can help the model learn to recognize objects in different positions.
5. Color jittering: This involves randomly changing the brightness, contrast, and saturation of the images in the dataset, which can help the model learn to recognize objects in different lighting conditions.
6. Cropping: This involves randomly cropping parts of the images in the dataset, which can help the model learn to focus on the most important features of the objects.

These techniques can be applied to the dataset during the training phase of the deep learning pipeline to generate new variations of the original images. The augmented dataset can then be used to train the model, which can improve its ability to generalize and recognize objects in different conditions.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques used in deep learning, these techniques are commonly used to improve model performance and prevent overfitting. Some of the most popular techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, translation, color jittering, and cropping.
