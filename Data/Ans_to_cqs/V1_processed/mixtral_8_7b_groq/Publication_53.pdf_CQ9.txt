The provided context does not explicitly mention where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only states that they used Python, fastai, and high-definition satellite images from three different repositories (i.e., <http://ecn.t3.tiles.virtualearth.net>, <https://api.mapbox.com>, and <https://server.arcgisonline.com>) for training a deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect farm dams. However, it does not specify if the data or code repository is available on Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other platform. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
