The provided context does not give specific details about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention some metrics and techniques related to the evaluation of the proposed IFTL method.

The context discusses the use of a predictive function f() that is trained using pairs (xi, yi) and used for predicting labels for new instances. This implies that the performance of the model could be evaluated by comparing the predicted labels with the actual labels using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a confusion matrix, which is a table used to describe the performance of a classification model. It summarizes the number of false positives, false negatives, true positives, and true negatives.

The context also discusses the concept of overconfidence in ELM, GRNN, or SVR, which arises when they make predictions on a dataset (target domain) that has a huge data distribution difference from the source domain data on which they are trained. To handle this issue, the proposed IFTL technique is implemented under the framework of label refinement.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the postprocessing steps involved after the model training may include the calculation of various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the generation of a confusion matrix. Additionally, the proposed IFTL technique involves a label refinement step to handle the issue of overconfidence.
