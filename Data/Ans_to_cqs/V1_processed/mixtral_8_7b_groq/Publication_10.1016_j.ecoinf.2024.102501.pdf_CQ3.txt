The provided context does not directly discuss data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of deep learning models for predicting dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in water. In this context, the deep learning model used is a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, which is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) used for sequential data.

For the data preprocessing methods, the context mentions that three different methods were trained and tested using the proposed method. However, it does not provide details on the specific data annotation techniques used.

In general, data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines depend on the specific task and data modality. For object detection and image segmentation tasks, common annotation techniques include bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and panoptic segmentation.

Bounding box annotation involves drawing a rectangle around an object of interest in an image. This technique is commonly used for object detection tasks, where the goal is to detect and classify objects in an image.

Instance segmentation involves labeling each pixel in an image with the class of the object it belongs to, while also distinguishing between different instances of the same class. This technique is commonly used for tasks such as image segmentation, where the goal is to identify and segment objects in an image.

Semantic segmentation involves labeling each pixel in an image with the class of the object it belongs to, but without distinguishing between different instances of the same class. This technique is commonly used for tasks such as scene understanding, where the goal is to identify and classify objects in a scene.

Panoptic segmentation involves both semantic and instance segmentation, where each pixel in an image is labeled with the class of the object it belongs to, while also distinguishing between different instances of the same class. This technique is commonly used for tasks such as scene understanding and autonomous driving.

In summary, while the provided context does not discuss specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for predicting DO concentration, common annotation techniques for object detection and image segmentation tasks include bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and panoptic segmentation.
