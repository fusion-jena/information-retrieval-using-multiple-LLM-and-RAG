I don't have access to the specific code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study you mentioned, as the context provided does not include a link to it. The context focuses on the comparison of various models for ecological data analysis, particularly the Sparrow population dataset, and their performance evaluation. However, it does not provide information about the code repository used for the deep learning pipeline. I recommend checking the paper's supplementary materials or contacting the authors directly to inquire about the code repository.
