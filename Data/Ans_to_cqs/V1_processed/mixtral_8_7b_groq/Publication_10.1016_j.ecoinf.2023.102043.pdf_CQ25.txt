The deep learning model in question is used for the purpose of audio classification, specifically for goat vocalization detection. The model is built upon YAMNet, a pre-trained deep neural network that has been trained on data from 521 classes. YAMNet follows the MobileV1 convolution architecture and is trained on the AudioSet-YouTube corpus.

To use YAMNet for goat vocalization detection, the audio data must first be processed by converting it to a monophonic channel, resampling it at 16 kHz, extracting the spectrogram using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) magnitudes of 25 ms overlapped by 15 ms, and calculating the Mel spectrogram by mapping to 64 bins of the Mel scale within the range of 125â€“7500 Hz. The processed audio data is then passed through the YAMNet model to extract embeddings. These embeddings are then fed as input to a sequential model with a reduce mean layer, which maps the YAMNet embeddings to the available labels.

The final layers of the network map the YAMNet embeddings to the available classes, which in this case is goat vocalizations. The dataset used for training, validation, and testing is divided into 70%, 10%, and 20% respectively. The model's performance is then evaluated based on its ability to accurately detect goat vocalizations in the test dataset.

In summary, the deep learning model in question is used for the purpose of audio classification, specifically for detecting goat vocalizations. The model utilizes YAMNet, a pre-trained deep neural network, and follows a series of processing steps to extract embeddings from the audio data, which are then mapped to the available classes.
