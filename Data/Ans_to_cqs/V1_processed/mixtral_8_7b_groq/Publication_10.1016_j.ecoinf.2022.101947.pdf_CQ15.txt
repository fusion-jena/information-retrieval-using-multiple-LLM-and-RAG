Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam used in the deep learning pipeline. However, the text does provide information about the process of optimizing the classification accuracy and the algorithm validation.

In the data validation process (Section 3.3), the researchers aimed to determine the optimal size for algorithm training and test sets. They observed that the optimal classification accuracy was obtained when the test set size was smallest relative to the training set. This suggests that the researchers used a technique to find the best balance between the training and test sets to optimize the performance of the model.

Furthermore, the researchers conducted algorithm validation using holdback trials to establish the minimum number of trails required for testing. They plotted the test set size against the actual test size, the predicted value for the test size, and the mean predicted value for each test size. This process helped them understand the variation in the sequential trials and how it could potentially impact the algorithm's accuracy.

While the context does not explicitly mention SGD, Adam, or any other optimization techniques, it is evident that the researchers followed a systematic approach to optimize their deep learning pipeline. They focused on finding the optimal balance between the training and test sets, validated their algorithm using holdback trials, and monitored the variation in the sequential trials to ensure the robustness of their model.

In summary, although the context does not provide specific information on the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it indicates that the researchers followed a rigorous process to optimize their model's performance. They focused on determining the optimal size for training and test sets, validated their algorithm using holdback trials, and monitored the variation in the sequential trials to ensure the robustness of their model.
