The deep learning pipeline in question utilizes the Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2015) for training both the autoencoder and the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classifier. The Adam optimizer is a popular choice due to its adaptive learning rate and ability to handle non-stationary objectives.

In the context of the autoencoder, the Adam optimizer is used to update the network weights iteratively during the training process. Additionally, a scheduler is employed to adjust the learning rate when the loss plateaus, ensuring improved convergence and preventing the learning process from getting stuck.

Similarly, in the MLP classifier, the Adam optimizer is utilized for training with the learning rate modified by a scheduler when the network reaches a plateau. This approach allows the model to fine-tune its parameters and adapt to the complexity of the classification task.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), it is worth noting that the Adam optimizer is an extension of SGD, incorporating techniques such as momentum and adaptive learning rates. Consequently, the deep learning pipeline benefits from the robustness and efficiency of SGD through the Adam optimizer.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline described in the context employs the Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2015) for training both the autoencoder and the MLP classifier. This optimizer, being an extension of SGD, offers adaptive learning rates and improved convergence, making it a suitable choice for the pipeline's optimization needs.
