The provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the methodology used in a study by E. Prasetyo et al. for clustering freshness data of species using ecological informatics. The study utilizes 2 to 10 clusters to find the appropriate number of freshness clusters for each species, and groups the data using a clustering method to automatically determine freshness class based on the dataset. However, it does not mention where the data repository is available. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
