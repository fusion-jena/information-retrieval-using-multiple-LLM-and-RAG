The context does not provide specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning models, including SeedNet. However, it is common practice to use Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) for training deep learning models due to their ability to perform parallel processing, which is well-suited for the matrix and vector operations used in deep learning. GPUs can significantly reduce training times compared to using only a Central Processing Unit (CPU). Other hardware accelerators, such as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) developed by Google, can also be used for deep learning training, offering even greater performance improvements. However, without specific information in the context, it is not possible to determine which specific hardware resources were used in this study.
