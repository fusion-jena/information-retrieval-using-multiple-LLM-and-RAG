After the model training process, there are several postprocessing steps that can be involved, such as the calculation of various metrics, generation of confusion matrices, and visualization of saliency maps. However, based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of these specific postprocessing steps having been carried out.

The context does mention that the data was divided into training, validation, and test sets, and that predictive models were constructed using both deep learning algorithms and traditional machine learning approaches. It also mentions that hyperparameter tuning was performed using GridSearchCV with cross-validation.

In the context of model evaluation, the test set is used to indicate the model's performance in real-world scenarios. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score can be calculated to evaluate the performance of the model. A confusion matrix can also be generated to provide a more detailed breakdown of the model's performance.

Saliency maps can be used as a tool for visualizing the importance of input features in the prediction made by a model. However, the provided context does not mention the use of saliency maps in the postprocessing stage.

In conclusion, while there are several postprocessing steps that are commonly used after model training, such as the calculation of metrics, generation of confusion matrices, and visualization of saliency maps, the provided context does not explicitly mention these steps having been carried out in this particular study.
