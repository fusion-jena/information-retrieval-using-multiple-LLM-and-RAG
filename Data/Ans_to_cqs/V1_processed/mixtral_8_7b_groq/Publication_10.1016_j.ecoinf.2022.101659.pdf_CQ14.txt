Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the use of data on valve gaping, temperature, and chlorophyll to improve predictions on productivity and aid in aquaculture decision-making. It also mentions the potential for further experimentation to devise indices that could be used in bioenergetic models. However, it does not mention any specific methods for hyperparameter optimization.

In general, there are several methods that can be used to optimize the hyperparameters of a model, including grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization. Grid search involves specifying a range of possible values for each hyperparameter and then training the model with all possible combinations of these values. Random search involves randomly selecting values for each hyperparameter from a specified range and then training the model with these values. Bayesian optimization involves using a probabilistic model to suggest the next set of hyperparameters to try based on the performance of previous sets of hyperparameters.

Without more information, it is not possible to say for certain how the hyperparameters of the model in this case are being optimized. It may be that the authors used one of the methods mentioned above or a different method entirely. Further details on the model and its training process would be needed in order to accurately answer this question.
