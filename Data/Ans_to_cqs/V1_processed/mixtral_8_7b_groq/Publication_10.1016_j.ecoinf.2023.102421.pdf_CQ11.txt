I'm sorry, but the provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The context mainly discusses LightGBM, a gradient boosting machine learning algorithm proposed by Microsoft, and the features used for aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation in ecological informatics.

The features mentioned include various bands and indices from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-1A satellites, such as Blue, Green, Red, Near Infrared, Vertical Transmit-Horizontal Receive Polarizations (VH), Vertical Transmit-Vertical Receive Polarizations (VV), and different vegetation indices.

LightGBM is a tree-based learning algorithm that implements leaf-wise splits and a novel sampling method called Gradient-Based One-Side Sampling. It is designed for handling large datasets and improving predictive efficiency. The algorithm is controlled by several parameter groups, including boosting parameters and learning task parameters.

However, the context does not provide any information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline.
