The provided context discusses the Wav2Vec model, a deep learning model used for Automatic Speech Recognition and other audio-related tasks. While it focuses on the architecture and training objectives of the model, it does mention some preprocessing steps taken before training.

The first step mentioned is normalization. In the feature encoder section, it's stated that the waveform is normalized before passing through the convolutional layer. Normalization is a common preprocessing step in deep learning, where the data is scaled to a smaller range, often between -1 and 1 or 0 and 1. This helps the model converge faster during training and can improve its performance.

The context also implies that the audio data is converted into a sequence of feature vectors, which involves dimensionality reduction. This is done by the feature encoder, which reduces the raw waveform into a sequence of feature vectors every 20 milliseconds. This step can be seen as a form of cleaning, as it removes unnecessary information and keeps only the relevant features.

However, the context does not explicitly mention other common preprocessing steps such as scaling or additional cleaning techniques. Scaling, like normalization, is a method used to adjust the range of the data. It's often used in conjunction with normalization and can help the model generalize better. Cleaning, on the other hand, can involve many techniques, from handling missing data to removing outliers. The context does not mention these additional steps.

In summary, the provided context mentions normalization and a form of cleaning (dimensionality reduction) as preprocessing steps for the Wav2Vec model. However, it does not discuss scaling or other cleaning techniques. Therefore, the answer to the query would be:


The preprocessing steps mentioned for the Wav2Vec model include normalization of the waveform and a form of cleaning through dimensionality reduction. However, the context does not explicitly mention scaling or other cleaning techniques.
