The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model is likely to be a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or a variant of it.

The context mentions that the study is about detecting underwater man-made objects (MMOs) in optical and sonar data using a non-supervised technique. In the study by Abu and Diamant (2022), a contour-based features analysis method is proposed to discern MMOs from natural environment, which suggests the use of shape-based features. CNNs are particularly good at extracting and learning shape-based features from images, making them a popular choice for object detection tasks.

Furthermore, the study by Han et al. (Han et al., 2022) proposed a DL technique titled LCSE-ResNet to detect, classify and locate vessels and oil platforms based on remote optical imagery. ResNet is a type of CNN that has shown excellent performance in various computer vision tasks.

Therefore, it can be reasonably assumed that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a CNN or a variant of it. However, this is an inference based on the provided context, and the exact type of model is not explicitly stated.
