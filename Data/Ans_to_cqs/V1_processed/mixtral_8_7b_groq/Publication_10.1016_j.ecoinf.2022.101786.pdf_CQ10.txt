The provided context does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The authors mention using the Darknet framework for their convolutional neural network (CNN) but do not provide a link to the specific code repository used in their research. They do mention that some model parameters were modified from the default configuration, but there is no information on how these modifications were implemented. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to the code repository for this deep learning pipeline.
