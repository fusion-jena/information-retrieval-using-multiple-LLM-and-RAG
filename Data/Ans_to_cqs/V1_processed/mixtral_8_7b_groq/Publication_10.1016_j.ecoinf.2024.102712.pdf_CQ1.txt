The provided context discusses the use of Sentinel-2 data in model-assisted frameworks and hierarchical modeling for various applications, but it does not directly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does imply that remote sensing data collected by sensors, such as Sentinel-2, are used in these modeling frameworks.

Deep learning pipelines often involve several stages, including data collection, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. In the context of remote sensing and geospatial analysis, data collection typically involves acquiring raw data from sensors, such as satellites or drones. This data can be in various forms, such as multispectral or hyperspectral images, LiDAR point clouds, or radar data.

For the specific case of Sentinel-2, it is a European Space Agency (ESA) Earth observation mission that provides high-resolution optical imagery. Sentinel-2 sensors acquire data in 13 spectral bands, with a spatial resolution ranging from 10 to 60 meters. This data can be used for land cover mapping, change detection, and other applications in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context and general knowledge of remote sensing and deep learning pipelines, we can infer that sensors, such as Sentinel-2, are used to collect raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Other methods for collecting raw data, such as surveys and public datasets, may also be used depending on the specific application and data requirements.
