Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The sources given mainly discuss various aspects of smart farming, such as precision agriculture, IoT-based monitoring systems, big data analysis, and reference architectures for smart farming data management. However, they do not mention any specific code repository for a deep learning pipeline.

One of the sources, Zhang et al. (2024), presents a fully automatic system for fish biomass estimation based on a deep neural network. Although the paper provides a detailed explanation of the system's architecture and methodology, it does not give information about the code repository or how to access the implementation.

In summary, I cannot find the code repository of the deep learning pipeline in the provided context. If the code repository is available, it has not been mentioned in the sources given.
