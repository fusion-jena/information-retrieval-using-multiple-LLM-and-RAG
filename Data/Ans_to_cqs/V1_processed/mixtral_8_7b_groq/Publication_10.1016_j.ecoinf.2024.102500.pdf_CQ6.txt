The provided context discusses the hyperparameter tuning process for Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), Gradient Boost (GB), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Random Forest (RF), and Extra Trees (ET) models, but it does not mention any preprocessing steps specifically for deep learning models. However, it can be inferred from general machine learning practices that preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, and cleaning are also essential for deep learning models.

In machine learning and deep learning, data preprocessing is a crucial step that includes various techniques to make the data suitable for modeling. These techniques help to bring the data into a standard format, which improves model performance and convergence during training. Some common preprocessing steps are:

1. Data cleaning: This step involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistent data entries.

2. Normalization and Scaling: These techniques are used to transform the data within a specific range or distribution, often between 0 and 1 or using standard normal distribution. Normalization and scaling are essential for distance-based algorithms and deep learning models, as they help to maintain a balanced contribution of each feature during training. Common techniques include min-max scaling, z-score normalization, and robust scaling.

3. Feature engineering: This step involves creating new features from existing ones, such as polynomial features, interaction features, or encoding categorical variables. Feature engineering can help improve model performance and interpretability.

4. Data splitting: This step involves dividing the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets. Proper data splitting helps to assess the model's performance and avoid overfitting.

5. Feature selection: This step involves selecting the most relevant features for the model, which can help reduce dimensionality, improve performance, and reduce training time.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps for deep learning models, it can be inferred that data preprocessing is an essential step in deep learning, as it is for other machine learning algorithms. Preprocessing techniques like data cleaning, normalization, scaling, feature engineering, data splitting, and feature selection are commonly applied to deep learning models to improve their performance and convergence during training.
