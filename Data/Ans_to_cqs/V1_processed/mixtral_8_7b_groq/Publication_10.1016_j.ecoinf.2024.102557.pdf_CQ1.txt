Based on the provided context, the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for studying fungal productivity in Mediterranean forest ecosystems are not explicitly mentioned. However, we can infer that the data collection process likely involves the use of permanent sample plots and field sampling over a period of 20 years.

In the study "A parsimonious view of the parsimony principle in ecology and evolution" by Coelho, Diniz-Filho, and Rangel (2019), they mention the use of "hundred permanent sample plots" for their research. This suggests that the data collection for the study on fungal productivity might have also involved setting up permanent sample plots to monitor and collect data on macrofungal productivity.

Additionally, the study "Synthesis and use of conservation and environmental evidence" by Christin, Hervet, Lecomte (2019) mentions the use of a "fungal database resulting from the sampling of more than 100 permanent sampling plots over 20 years." This explicitly confirms the use of permanent sample plots and long-term field sampling for data collection.

While the context does not explicitly mention the use of surveys, sensors, or public datasets, it is possible that these methods were also used in conjunction with the permanent sample plots. Surveys could have been used to gather additional information about the study area and the fungal species present. Sensors might have been used to collect real-time data on environmental factors affecting fungal productivity. Public datasets could have been used to supplement the data collected from the permanent sample plots.

In summary, while the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for studying fungal productivity in Mediterranean forest ecosystems are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, it is likely that the data collection involved the use of permanent sample plots and long-term field sampling. Additionally, surveys, sensors, or public datasets might have also been used in the data collection process.
