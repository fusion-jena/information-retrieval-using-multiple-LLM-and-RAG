The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of four parameters, namely, coefficient of determination (R2), root-mean-square error (RMSE), ratio of performance to deviation (RPD), and ratio of performance to interquartile range (RPIQ). These parameters are used to assess the accuracy of both calibrated and validated models. The model is considered accurate when the bias is close to zero. RPD corresponds to the ratio of standard deviation (SD) to RMSE, which is widely used to evaluate VNIR spectral models. RPIQ considers prediction errors and variations in observations simultaneously, providing a more objective and easily comparable measure of model validity in model validation studies.

In the specific case of the study in question, the authors used SVM (Support Vector Machine) as a kernel-based machine learning algorithm for regression. The algorithm maps each covariate in the training set to a high-dimensional feature space by using a kernel function. Epsilon refers to an insensitive loss function that maps the maximum epsilon deviation of the independent data and the associated training data. Errors within the epsilon are ignored, whereas errors larger than the epsilon are penalized. The epsilon-SVR model and Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) are used to construct the calibration model. Epsilon-SVR optimal parameters (e.g., cost C, epsilon p, and gamma g) are used to make the model achieve the best accuracy, where parameters C and p help us avoid overfitting of SVMR.

The authors performed SVM in MATLAB R2016a, and the training model was established by using the libsvm package in MATLAB. The authors used the RPD parameter to select the best parameter values for the SVM model, as mentioned in the first sentence of the context. Therefore, it can be inferred that the authors monitored the model performance during training by evaluating the RPD parameter for different combinations of cost C, epsilon p, and gamma g parameters. The authors selected the parameter values that resulted in the highest RPD value, indicating the best model performance.

In summary, the authors implemented a strategy to monitor the model performance during training by evaluating the RPD parameter for different combinations of cost C, epsilon p, and gamma g parameters. The authors selected the parameter values that resulted in the highest RPD value, indicating the best model performance.
