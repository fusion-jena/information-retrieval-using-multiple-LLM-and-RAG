The specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the CNN model was trained on a dataset using manual annotations of moths. This dataset was collected for the purpose of training and validating the CNN model for moth classification. The authors mention that one of the potential sources of error in the algorithm was the choice of dataset used for training and validation. They also mention that increasing the number of images available for training the CNN model could improve performance. Therefore, it can be inferred that the dataset used is specific to moths and was created by the authors or obtained through some other means specific to their research. The context does not provide enough information to determine if other datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet were used in this research.
