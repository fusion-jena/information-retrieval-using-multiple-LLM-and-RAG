The data formats used in the deep learning pipeline described in the provided context are audio and image. The audio recordings are converted into spectrograms, which are then represented as single-channel images. These image representations are used as input for the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based models, such as ResNet-50 and Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST). Additionally, the HuBERT model operates directly on the 1-D waveform of the audio recordings. Therefore, the data formats used in this pipeline are specifically audio and its derived image representation (spectrograms), and not video or CSV files.
