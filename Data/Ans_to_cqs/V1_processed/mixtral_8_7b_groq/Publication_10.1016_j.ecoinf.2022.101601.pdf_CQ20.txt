The provided context does not seem to contain information about the specific hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. The texts focus on various topics, including permafrost, tuberculosis epidemiology, and decision support systems, but none of them mention the hardware used for training deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query based on the given context.
