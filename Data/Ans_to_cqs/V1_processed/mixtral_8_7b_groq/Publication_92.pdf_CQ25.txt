Based on the provided context, the deep learning model in question is used for object detection, specifically fish detection in videos. 

The model's architecture is based on GoogLeNet, which is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed for image classification tasks. CNNs are particularly useful for object detection because they can learn to build their own features from raw image data. This is achieved through the use of convolutional layers, which transform the signal from the previous layer using convolutional kernels, an activation function, and a pooling phase. 

In the context of fish detection, the CNN is trained on a database of images, each associated with a label representing the fish species. During training, the CNN learns to extract features from the images that are relevant for distinguishing between different fish species. 

After training, the CNN can be used to analyze video frames and detect the presence of fish. This is done by sliding a window across each frame and computing a motion score for each window. The motion score is based on the average absolute difference between the current window and the same window in the previous frame. The hypothesis is that most fish are moving, so a high motion score indicates the presence of a fish. 

To improve detection accuracy, the model uses inception layers, which allow for a reduction in the dimensionality of the input data. This reduces the dependence on the dimensional impact of the input data, which can improve detection performance. 

Overall, the deep learning model described in the context is designed for the specific task of fish detection in videos. It uses a CNN architecture to learn relevant features from training data, and then applies these features to detect fish in video frames based on motion scores.
