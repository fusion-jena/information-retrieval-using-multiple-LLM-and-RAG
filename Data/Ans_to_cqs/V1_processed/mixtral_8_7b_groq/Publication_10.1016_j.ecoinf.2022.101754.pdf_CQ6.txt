Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model for forest above-ground biomass (AGB) estimation. However, it is well-known that preprocessing data is a crucial step in machine learning projects, and it often includes several steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning.

Normalization and scaling are common preprocessing techniques used to transform the data to a similar range, which can improve the model's performance. For instance, normalization scales the data between 0 and 1, while scaling can preserve the original variance of the data. These techniques can be useful when the features have different units or scales, which can affect the model's learning process.

Cleaning the data is another essential step that involves handling missing values, outliers, and noisy data. These issues can affect the model's accuracy and lead to poor performance. Therefore, it is crucial to preprocess the data and remove any inconsistencies before training the model.

In the context of AGB estimation from LiDAR and Landsat 8 data, preprocessing steps may include:

1. Radiometric calibration: This step involves adjusting the sensor's response to account for atmospheric conditions, sensor degradation, and other factors that can affect the data's quality.
2. Geometric correction: This step involves aligning the data with a reference coordinate system to ensure accurate spatial representation.
3. Noise removal: This step involves removing any noise or outliers in the data that can affect the model's performance.
4. Feature extraction: This step involves extracting relevant features from the data that can be used as input to the model. For instance, LiDAR data can provide information about the height, density, and structure of the forest, while Landsat 8 data can provide information about the land cover, vegetation index, and other biophysical parameters.
5. Normalization or scaling: This step involves transforming the data to a similar range to improve the model's learning process.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model for AGB estimation, it is well-known that preprocessing data is a crucial step in machine learning projects. Preprocessing steps for AGB estimation from LiDAR and Landsat 8 data may include radiometric calibration, geometric correction, noise removal, feature extraction, and normalization or scaling.
