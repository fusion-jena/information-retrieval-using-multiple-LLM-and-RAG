The specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for training and testing the depth-attention YOLOv5 model for fruit detection and yield estimation are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that a prior synthetic dataset was used in conjunction with the depth-attention YOLOv5 model for fitting recognition.

In addition to this, there are several other studies mentioned in the context that have used various datasets for fruit detection and yield estimation using deep learning models. For instance, Koirala et al. (2019a) provide an overview and review of deep learning methods for fruit detection and yield estimation, but they do not specify the datasets used in their study. Similarly, Koirala et al. (2019b) present a deep learning approach for real-time fruit detection and orchard fruit load estimation, but they do not mention the datasets used in their study.

Furthermore, Lin et al. (2019) propose an in-field citrus detection and localization method based on RGB-D image analysis, but they do not provide information on the datasets used in their study. Liu et al. (2020) present an improved kiwifruit detection method using a deep learning model, but again, they do not specify the datasets used in their study.

Therefore, while the specific datasets used in the depth-attention YOLOv5 model for fruit detection and yield estimation are not provided in the given context, there are several other studies that have used various datasets for fruit detection and yield estimation using deep learning models.
