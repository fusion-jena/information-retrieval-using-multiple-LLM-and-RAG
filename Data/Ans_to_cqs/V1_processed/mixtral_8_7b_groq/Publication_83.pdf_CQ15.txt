The text provided describes the use of the Adam optimizer in the deep learning pipeline for training a VGG-style network. This network is used for classifying acoustic scenes and bird sounds. The Adam optimizer is a popular optimization algorithm used in machine learning, known for its efficiency and adaptability. It is a type of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method that updates network weights based on estimates of the gradient of the loss function.

In the described pipeline, the Adam optimizer is used with a learning rate of 10âˆ’4 for training the VGG-style network. The network is trained for 200 epochs with a batch size of 64 samples. The categorical cross entropy is utilized as the loss function.

It is important to note that the text does not mention the use of any other optimization techniques, such as different types of SGD or learning rate schedules. However, the choice of the Adam optimizer and its specific configuration indicate a well-thought-out and effective optimization strategy for the deep learning pipeline.
