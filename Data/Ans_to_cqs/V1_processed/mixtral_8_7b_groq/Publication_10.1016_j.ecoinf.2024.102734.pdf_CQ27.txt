Based on the information provided, the specifics of the model deployment process are not detailed. However, we can infer some steps that might have been taken based on common deep learning practices.



After training and evaluating the model using the test dataset, the next step would typically be to serialize the model. Model serialization involves saving the model's architecture, learned parameters, and optimizer information in a file format that can be later loaded for making predictions. This is useful for deploying the model in a production environment where the model can be used for serving predictions without having to retrain the model.

The serialized model can then be deployed on a platform suitable for serving predictions. The choice of platform would depend on factors such as the expected volume of predictions, latency requirements, and the infrastructure available. For instance, for low to moderate prediction volumes, a lightweight server or a cloud function might be sufficient. For higher prediction volumes, a distributed computing platform such as Kubernetes or Spark might be more appropriate.

Additionally, the model might have been containerized using a tool such as Docker. Containerization involves packaging the model along with its dependencies in a container image, which can then be deployed on any platform that supports the container runtime. Containerization helps ensure consistency in the model's environment and makes it easier to deploy and manage the model.

Finally, the model might have been integrated with an application or a service for making predictions. This would involve creating an API endpoint or a user interface that accepts input data and returns the model's predictions.

It's important to note that these are inferred steps based on common deep learning practices and the specific details of the model deployment process might vary based on the requirements and constraints of the project.
