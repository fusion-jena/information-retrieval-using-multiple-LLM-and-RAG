Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete for the insect classification models in STARdbi. However, it is mentioned that users can train models locally using the programs provided in the STARdbi website as a Google Colab notebook. Therefore, it can be inferred that the criteria for determining training completion would depend on the specific training algorithm and parameters used by the researchers.

In general, common criteria for determining training completion include:

1. Validation loss plateau: This is the most common criterion used to determine training completion. Training stops when the validation loss (i.e., the loss calculated on a separate validation dataset) stops decreasing or starts increasing, indicating that the model is starting to overfit the training data.
2. Early stopping: This is a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting. Training stops when the validation loss starts increasing, even if the training loss is still decreasing.
3. Number of epochs: Training stops after a fixed number of epochs (i.e., complete passes through the training dataset) has been reached.
4. Patience: Training stops if the validation loss does not improve for a certain number of epochs, known as patience.

It is important to note that the choice of criteria for determining training completion depends on the specific problem and dataset being used. Therefore, it is up to the researchers to choose the appropriate criteria based on their expertise and the characteristics of the problem.

In summary, while the specific criteria used to determine training completion for the insect classification models in STARdbi is not provided in the context, it can be inferred that the criteria would depend on the specific training algorithm and parameters used by the researchers. Common criteria for determining training completion include validation loss plateau, early stopping, number of epochs, and patience.
