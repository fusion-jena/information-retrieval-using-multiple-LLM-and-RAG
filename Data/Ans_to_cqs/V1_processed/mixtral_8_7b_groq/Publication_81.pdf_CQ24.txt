Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, the context does discuss the use of the Elastic Net in the proposed ESK model for fish classification, which can help mitigate overfitting in small datasets.

The Elastic Net is a regularization technique that is a linear combination of L1 and L2 regularization. It can be used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which encourages the model to have simpler weights and avoid memorizing the training data. This can be particularly useful in the context of fish classification, where the number of species may be limited, and the high dimensionality of DNA barcode sequences can lead to overfitting.

In addition, the ESK model uses a stacked autoencoder (SAE) to learn deep features from the DNA barcode sequences. Autoencoders are neural networks that are trained to reconstruct their input data. They consist of an encoder network that maps the input data to a lower-dimensional representation, and a decoder network that maps the lower-dimensional representation back to the original input data. Stacked autoencoders are created by stacking multiple autoencoders on top of each other, with each autoencoder learning to reconstruct the output of the previous autoencoder. This can help learn more abstract and robust features from the data.

While the context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, the use of regularization techniques like Elastic Net and deep learning models like stacked autoencoders can help improve the generalization ability of the model and prevent overfitting. These techniques can help ensure that the model is not overly reliant on random fluctuations in the training data and can generalize well to new, unseen data.
