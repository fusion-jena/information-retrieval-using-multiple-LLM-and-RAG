Based on the provided context, the text does not mention the use of a deep learning model or any metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall to evaluate its performance. Instead, it discusses a study that combines least squares methods with genetic algorithms and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for estimating model parameters using field data.

The genetic algorithm is used to generate random combinations of initial values and evaluate their fitness. The algorithm is repeated multiple times, and the rows of the database are reordered according to the sum of the residuals. The final parameter values, their distribution, and associated uncertainty are obtained from the traces of values for each parameter in the independent chains provided by the hybrid MCMC algorithm.

Therefore, the provided context does not answer the query regarding the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model.
