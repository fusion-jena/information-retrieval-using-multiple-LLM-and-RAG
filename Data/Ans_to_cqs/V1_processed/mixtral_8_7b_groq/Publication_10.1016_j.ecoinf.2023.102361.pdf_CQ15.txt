The provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss various deep learning models used for image classification, such as VGG16, VGG19, ResNet-50, Inception-V3, InceptionResNetV2, Xception, DenseNet121, DenseNet169, DenseNet201, and MobileNetV2.

These models are typically trained using optimization algorithms like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, or RMSprop. The choice of optimization algorithm can significantly impact the training process and the final model performance.

For instance, SGD is a simple yet effective optimization algorithm that updates the model parameters by computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to each parameter. However, it can sometimes be slow to converge or get stuck in local minima.

Adam, on the other hand, is an adaptive optimization algorithm that combines the advantages of SGD and other optimization algorithms like Adagrad and RMSprop. Adam adjusts the learning rate for each parameter based on the estimated first and second moments of the gradients. This makes it more robust to noisy gradients and sparse data, which can be particularly useful for training deep neural networks.

Therefore, while the provided context does not specify the optimization techniques used, it is reasonable to assume that optimization algorithms like SGD, Adam, or RMSprop were used during the training of the deep learning models.
