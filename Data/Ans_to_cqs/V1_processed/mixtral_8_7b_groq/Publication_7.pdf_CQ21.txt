The provided context discusses the training and testing of a coral reef image classifier using a deep neural network, but it does not explicitly mention any post-processing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. However, it does mention some steps that are related to the evaluation of the classifier's performance.

The authors conducted three experiments to evaluate the classifier's performance. In the first experiment, the classifier was trained on two-thirds of the images from the year 2011 and tested on the remaining images from the same year. In the second experiment, the images from year 2011 were used for training and the images from 2012 and 2013 constitute the test set. In the third experiment, the training set consisted of two-thirds of the images from the years 2011, 2012 and 2013, whereas the test set consists of all the remaining images from the same years. The authors reported the accuracy of the classifier for each of the experiments.

Additionally, the authors mentioned that they used a subset of the Benthoz15 dataset, which consists of 4,750 images with 237,500 expert-annotated points collected over a span of 3 years (2011 to 2013) for training their classifier. They also applied some pre-processing steps such as color channel stretch on each image in the dataset.

In summary, the provided context discusses the training and testing of a coral reef image classifier, the dataset used, and some pre-processing steps applied. However, it does not mention any specific post-processing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The authors reported the accuracy of the classifier for different experiments, which can be considered as a metric to evaluate the performance of the classifier.
