The two metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are precision and recall. These metrics are calculated using a bounding box marked as true positive if it has an intersection-over-union (IoU) of greater than 0.5. The IoU is the ratio of the area of bounding box overlap to the area of bounding box union between the predicted tree crown and the visually annotated crowns in the evaluation data. The deep learning model reports a confidence score between 0 and 1 for each bounding box prediction. To transform these scores into precision and recall statistics, a threshold of box scores to accept is defined. As the threshold is lowered, a greater number of trees will be captured, but at the expense of decreased precision. The performance of the deep learning approach is shown across all bounding box probability thresholds between 0 and 1 with an interval of 0.1. IoU precision and recall are reported separately and do not capture differences in bounding box confidence scores. The Average Precision (AP) metric, which is the area under the precision-recall curve computed at the 11 fixed 0.1 intervals between 0 and 1, is used to compare the different generalization approaches.

It is important to note that the provided context does not mention the accuracy metric. Therefore, it is not possible to confirm whether accuracy is used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, precision and recall are indeed used as evaluation metrics.
