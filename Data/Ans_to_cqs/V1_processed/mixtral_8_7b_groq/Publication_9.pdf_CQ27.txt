The text provided does not give specific details about the process used to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model training procedure and options are included in the model training instructions provided on the GitHub repository. It also mentions that the model training involves iteratively minimizing the error between model output and expected output by optimally adjusting model weights and reaching model convergence using stochastic gradient descent with backpropagation.

Moreover, the text mentions the use of pre-trained CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) as a starting point for recognition tasks, which suggests that the trained model might have been serialized and saved in a format that can be easily loaded and used in other applications.

However, the platform or environment used for deploying the model is not specified in the text. It is possible that the model was deployed on a local machine, or on a cloud-based platform, but the text does not provide enough information to make a conclusive answer.

In summary, while the text provides some information about the model training procedure, it does not give specific details about the process used to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization and platform selection.
