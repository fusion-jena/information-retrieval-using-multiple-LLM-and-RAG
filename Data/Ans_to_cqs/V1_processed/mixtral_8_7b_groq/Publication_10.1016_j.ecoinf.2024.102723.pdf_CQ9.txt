Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The context includes details about the methods used in the pipeline, such as the MCD and VBI methods, as well as references to the TensorFlow and Keras frameworks used for implementation. However, there is no mention of where the data used in the pipeline is stored or how it can be accessed. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
