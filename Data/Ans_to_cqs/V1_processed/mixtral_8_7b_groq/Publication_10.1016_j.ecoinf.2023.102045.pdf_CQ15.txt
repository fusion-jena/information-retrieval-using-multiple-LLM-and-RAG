Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, the text does mention the use of neural networks in the context of improving the cblindplot package for color-blind users. Neural networks are a type of deep learning model, and they often require the use of optimization techniques to train their parameters effectively.

Common optimization techniques used in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad, among others. These algorithms are used to minimize the loss function of the model by iteratively adjusting the parameters in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function.

Without more information, it is difficult to say which specific optimization technique was used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the text. However, it is reasonable to assume that one or more of these techniques were used, given the mention of neural networks and the need to optimize their parameters during training.
