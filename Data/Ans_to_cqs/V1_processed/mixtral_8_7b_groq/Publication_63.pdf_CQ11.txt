Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text describes the methods and data sources used in the study, but it does not mention where the code or data for the pipeline is stored. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. If you are interested in the data or code used in this study, I would recommend contacting the authors directly to inquire about availability.
