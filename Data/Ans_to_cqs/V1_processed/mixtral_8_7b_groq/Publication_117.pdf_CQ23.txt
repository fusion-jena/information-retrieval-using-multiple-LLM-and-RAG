The text provided does not give explicit details about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model was trained using a dataset of 500 survey images, which were tiled into smaller subimages and passed through a version of the YOLO DCNN (Redmon & Farhadi, 2018). The resulting object detections were then filtered using identifications from the Zooniverse data. This process created a list of potential object locations, which were used for image classification tasks.

In the context of deep learning, there are several measures that could have been taken to ensure the generalizability of the model. These include:

1. Diverse dataset: Using a dataset that includes a wide variety of images, with different lighting conditions, angles, and backgrounds, can help ensure that the model can accurately classify objects in different settings.
2. Cross-validation: Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into several subsets, or folds, and training the model on all but one of these folds. The model is then tested on the remaining fold, and this process is repeated for each fold. This helps ensure that the model can accurately classify objects it has not seen before.
3. Stratified splitting: Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets in a way that ensures that each subset has a similar distribution of classes. This can help ensure that the model is trained on a representative sample of the data.

Without more information, it is difficult to say for certain which of these measures were taken. However, the use of a large and diverse dataset of survey images, as well as the filtering of object detections using Zooniverse data, suggests that some steps were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
