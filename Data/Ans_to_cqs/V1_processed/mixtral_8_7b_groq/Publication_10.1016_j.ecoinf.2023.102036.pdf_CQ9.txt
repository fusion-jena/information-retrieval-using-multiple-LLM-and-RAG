The provided context does not give information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of deep learning techniques in image classification for a limited number of classes with a small amount of labeled images in each category. The context also mentions the growing computing capability of machines and the availability of big data for image content representation, as well as the application of computer vision in fisheries dating back to the 1980s. However, there is no mention of where the data repository for the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
