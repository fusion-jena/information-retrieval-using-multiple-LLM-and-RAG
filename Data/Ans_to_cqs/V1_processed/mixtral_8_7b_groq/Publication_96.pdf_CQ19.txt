The text does not provide specific information about which deep learning framework was used to build the model. However, it mentions that the study was conducted using graphics processing units (GPUs) and specialized hardware components for running parallel arithmetic operations, which suggests that a GPU-accelerated framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch was likely used. Additionally, the study used Google Cloud computing, which supports both TensorFlow and PyTorch, further indicating that either of these frameworks could have been used. Without more specific information from the text, it is not possible to give a definitive answer.
