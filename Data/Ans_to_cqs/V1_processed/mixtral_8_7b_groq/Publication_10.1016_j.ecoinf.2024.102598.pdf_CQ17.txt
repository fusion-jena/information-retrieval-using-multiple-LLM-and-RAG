The provided context discusses ensemble modeling, machine learning algorithms, and forest fire susceptibility prediction. However, it does not explicitly mention regularization methods used in deep learning to prevent overfitting, such as dropout and L2 regularization.

In deep learning, overfitting is a common issue where a model learns the training data too well, including its noise, and performs poorly on unseen data. Regularization techniques are used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty to the loss function, which discourages the model from learning overly complex patterns in the training data.

Dropout is a regularization technique used in deep learning, particularly in neural networks. During training, dropout randomly sets a fraction of the neurons in a layer to zero, effectively preventing the network from relying too heavily on any single neuron. This helps to reduce overfitting and improves the model's generalization performance.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is another regularization technique used in deep learning. It adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the model's weights. This encourages the model to have smaller weights, which in turn reduces the model's complexity and helps prevent overfitting.

In summary, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. However, dropout and L2 regularization are two commonly used techniques that can help prevent overfitting in deep learning models.
