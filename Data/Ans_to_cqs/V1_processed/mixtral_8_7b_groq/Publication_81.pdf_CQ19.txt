The context provided does not give specific information about the deep learning frameworks used to implement the ESK model. However, it is mentioned that the model uses Elastic Net-Stacked Autoencoder (EN-SAE) and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) for learning features and generating a threshold, respectively.

Elastic Net-Stacked Autoencoder (EN-SAE) is a deep learning architecture that combines Elastic Net regularization with Stacked Autoencoders. Elastic Net is a linear regression method that uses both L1 and L2 regularization, while Stacked Autoencoders are a type of neural network that learns a hierarchical representation of the input data.

Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is a non-parametric method for estimating the probability density function of a random variable. It is often used for outlier detection and anomaly detection.

While the context does not specify the deep learning framework used, popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch provide implementations for Elastic Net, Stacked Autoencoders, and KDE. Therefore, it is possible that the ESK model was implemented using either of these frameworks. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
