The provided pieces of context do not contain information about a deep learning pipeline or its code repository. The context discusses various machine learning algorithms, such as Support Vector Networks, k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Random Forest (RF), which have been used for land use and land cover (LULC) classification using remote sensing data, specifically satellite image data. However, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or its code repository.

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that focuses on neural networks with many layers (hence "deep"). While the context discusses neural networks, it only mentions the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) type of ANN, which typically has only one or two hidden layers. This is not considered a deep learning model.

Therefore, I cannot provide the code repository for the deep learning pipeline because it is not mentioned in the provided context.
