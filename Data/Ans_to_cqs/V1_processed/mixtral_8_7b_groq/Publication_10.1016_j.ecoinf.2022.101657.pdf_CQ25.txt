The deep learning model in the context provided is used for object detection, specifically for identifying and locating animal species in images obtained from camera traps. This is evident in the works of Schindler and Steinhage (2021) who use a combination of Mask R-CNN with Flow-Guided Feature Aggregation to optimize instance segmentation of animal species in video clips captured by camera traps. Similarly, Bochkovskiy et al. (2020) developed YOLOv4, a state-of-the-art object detection system that can be used for real-time detection of objects in images and videos, including those from camera traps.

Moreover, the purpose of using deep learning models in camera traps is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of data collection and analysis. Traditional camera traps often capture a large number of empty images that are later discarded, consuming storage space and analysis time. By using AI and machine learning techniques "at the edge" - on the device itself - researchers aim to reduce the amount of useless data collected. This is highlighted in the text where it mentions the use of AI in commercial camera traps and the exploration of machine learning techniques by the research community to minimize the collection of unnecessary data.

Furthermore, there is a desire to train neural networks for bespoke sets of species, which would make the models more suitable for specific regions and sets of species. This would enhance the accuracy of species identification and could potentially reduce the number of false positives or negatives. However, further research is needed to automate this process and ensure the robustness and reliability of the models.

In summary, the deep learning model in the provided context is used for object detection, specifically for the identification and location of animal species in camera trap images. The aim is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of data collection and analysis, and to explore the possibility of training models for specific sets of species.
