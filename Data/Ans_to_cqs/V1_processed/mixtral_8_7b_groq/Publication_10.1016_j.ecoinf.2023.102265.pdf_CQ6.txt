Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the images used in the study were prepared in a way that they could be processed by the pre-trained ResNet-50 CNN model.

In computer vision tasks, preprocessing steps typically include image normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Image normalization is the process of adjusting the values of pixels in an image to a common range, often between 0 and 1, to make the data consistent and reduce the effects of noise. Scaling refers to resizing the images to a specific dimension, which is important for training deep learning models since the input size needs to be consistent. Cleaning involves removing any unwanted artifacts or noise from the images that might interfere with the model's ability to learn useful features.

In this study, the authors used a dataset of 500 honey bee images, which were preprocessed and then passed through a pre-trained ResNet-50 CNN model to extract 1000 features for training their classifier model. The preprocessing steps could have included image normalization, scaling, and cleaning, but the context does not provide specific details.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly state the preprocessing steps taken, it can be inferred that the images were preprocessed in some way to be compatible with the pre-trained ResNet-50 CNN model.
