Based on the information provided, the specific type of deep learning model used is not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is used for regression tasks, as it is being evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R2), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE), and correlation coefficient (COR). These evaluation metrics are commonly used for assessing the performance of regression models, which predict continuous numerical values.

In the given table, the deep learning model is compared to statistical models and other machine learning models in predicting groundwater (GW) salinity hazard maps for training and testing datasets. The deep learning model, along with the other models, is evaluated based on its performance statistics, including NSE, COR, KGE, and R2 for the training and testing datasets.

The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is to predict the GW salinity hazard maps. The model takes input features and generates output values representing the GW salinity hazard levels. The deep learning model's ability to predict these hazard maps is evaluated using the mentioned performance metrics.

It is important to note that deep learning models can be used for various tasks, such as classification, segmentation, and object detection. However, based on the provided context, the deep learning model is being used for a regression task, specifically predicting GW salinity hazard maps.
