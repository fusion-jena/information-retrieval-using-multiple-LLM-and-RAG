The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of four evaluation criteria for machine learning models: coefficient of determination (R2), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE), and correlation coefficient (COR). These criteria provide a comprehensive assessment of the models' performance in predicting groundwater (GW) salinity hazard maps for both training and testing datasets.

For the training dataset, the models' performance is evaluated using statistical measures such as frequency ratio (FR) and statistical index (SI), as well as machine learning models like Random Forest (RF) and Classification and Regression Trees (CART). The NSE values for the training dataset range from 0.63 to 0.88 for CART and RF models, respectively, indicating good performance. The COR values for RF and CART models are 0.95 and 0.85, respectively, indicating strong correlation between the predicted and actual values. The KGE values for RF and CART models are 0.794 and 0.70, respectively, indicating good agreement between the predicted and observed datasets. The R2 values for RF and CART models are 0.794 and 0.89, respectively, indicating that the models can explain a significant proportion of the variance in the dataset.

The testing dataset is used to further evaluate the models' performance and generalizability. The NSE values for the testing dataset range from 0.63 to 0.88 for CART and RF models, respectively, indicating good performance. The COR values for RF and CART models are 0.897 and 0.85, respectively, indicating strong correlation between the predicted and actual values. The KGE values for RF and CART models are 0.794 and 0.75, respectively, indicating good agreement between the predicted and observed datasets. The R2 values for RF and CART models are 0.794 and 0.91, respectively, indicating that the models can explain a significant proportion of the variance in the dataset.

In summary, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of four evaluation criteria for machine learning models: coefficient of determination (R2), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE), and correlation coefficient (COR). The models' performance is evaluated using both training and testing datasets, and the results indicate that the models have good performance and generalizability in predicting groundwater salinity hazard maps.
