Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when the training of a model is complete. However, it can be inferred that the training process involves the use of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) fisheries data, which includes information on catchability, fishing gears, environmental parameters, and life-history traits.

The training process appears to be focused on generating new knowledge and enhancing classification precision. The paper mentions the use of the upper confidence limit of the log-normal distribution to select species with an outstanding impact score, aiming to maximize the probability of identifying truly impacted species (true positives) and increase classification precision.

However, the context does not provide information on specific training completion criteria such as validation loss plateau or convergence of model parameters. It is possible that the authors did not include these details in the provided text, or they might be presented in other sections of the paper that were not provided in the context.

In summary, while the context offers insights into the data and objectives of the training process, it does not provide specific information on the criteria used to determine when the training is complete.
