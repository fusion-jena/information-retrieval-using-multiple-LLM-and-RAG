The provided pieces of context do not contain specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for flood susceptibility mapping. However, I can provide some general information about commonly used optimization techniques in deep learning.

Optimization techniques are essential components of deep learning pipelines, as they help to minimize the loss function and improve the model's performance. Some of the most commonly used optimization techniques in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and Adagrad.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a simple optimization algorithm that updates the model's parameters by taking a step in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function. SGD is widely used due to its simplicity and efficiency, but it can be sensitive to the learning rate and may converge slowly.

Adam is a popular optimization algorithm that combines the advantages of SGD and other optimization techniques. Adam uses an adaptive learning rate that is calculated based on the moving averages of the gradient and the squared gradient. This adaptive learning rate allows Adam to adjust the step size dynamically, making it more robust to noisy gradients and improving the convergence rate.

Adagrad is another optimization algorithm that uses an adaptive learning rate. Adagrad adjusts the learning rate based on the historical gradient information, giving more weight to the parameters with infrequent updates. This makes Adagrad particularly useful for sparse data and problems with non-uniform weights.

Without more specific information, it is difficult to determine which optimization technique was used in the deep learning pipeline for flood susceptibility mapping. However, based on the general information provided, it is likely that one of these optimization techniques or a similar variant was used.
