Based on the provided context, there is no information indicating which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model, such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. The context mainly focuses on the methodologies and data sources used for applying machine learning and evaluating spatiotemporal models of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and aboveground biomass (AGB) predictions. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
