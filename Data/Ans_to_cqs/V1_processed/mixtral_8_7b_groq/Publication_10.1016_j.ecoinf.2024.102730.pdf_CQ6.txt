The provided context discusses the use of deep learning models, specifically Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), for predicting vegetation phenology characteristics. However, it does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps taken before training the models. Therefore, I will provide a general overview of common preprocessing steps involved in preparing data for deep learning.

Deep learning models, like MLPs, usually require data to be preprocessed to improve model performance and convergence during training. Preprocessing steps can include:

1. Data cleaning: Removing or correcting erroneous, missing, or irrelevant data points that may negatively impact model performance.

2. Normalization or scaling: Transforming data to a common range or scale, often between 0 and 1 or using standardization (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1). This helps deep learning models converge faster and perform better, as it ensures that all features contribute equally to the learning process. Common normalization techniques include min-max scaling and z-score normalization.

3. Feature engineering: Deriving new features from existing ones to capture hidden patterns or relationships. This can include techniques like polynomial feature creation, binning, and interaction features.

4. Handling categorical variables: Transforming categorical data into a format suitable for deep learning models. This can be done through one-hot encoding or embedding techniques.

5. Splitting the dataset: Dividing the dataset into training, validation, and test sets to assess model performance and prevent overfitting.

In the context of the study, it is likely that the researchers performed some or all of these preprocessing steps before training their MLP models. However, the specific preprocessing techniques used are not mentioned in the provided context.
