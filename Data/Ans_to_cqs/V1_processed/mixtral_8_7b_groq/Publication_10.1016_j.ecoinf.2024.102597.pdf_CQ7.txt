Based on the provided context, there is no information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it is mentioned that a five-fold cross-validation was conducted for the machine learning models, but this method is not typically used in deep learning.

In deep learning, data splitting is usually done using a train-test split, where a portion of the data (often 80%) is used for training the model, and the remaining portion (often 20%) is used for testing the model. This split is done randomly, and the test set is used to evaluate the performance of the trained model.

Additionally, for more complex deep learning models, a validation set may also be used during the training process. This set is used to provide an unbiased evaluation of the model during the training process, allowing for adjustments to be made to prevent overfitting. The validation set is typically a subset of the training data, and it is not used in the final evaluation of the model.

In summary, while the provided context does not give information on the specific criteria used for data splitting in deep learning, it is typically done using a train-test split, and optionally a validation set for more complex models.
