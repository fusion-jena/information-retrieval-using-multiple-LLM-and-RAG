Based on the provided context, there are no specific details mentioned about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it is mentioned that the models were evaluated using various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1-score. Therefore, it can be inferred that the calculation of these metrics was a part of the postprocessing steps.

Additionally, the context mentions that the proposed model is able to quickly extract important features and demonstrates excellent performance in recognizing different plants with a high accuracy rate. This suggests that some form of feature extraction or visualization technique, such as saliency maps, may have been used to validate the model's ability to focus on important features.

Furthermore, the context also mentions that a comparative analysis was conducted with several models, including ResNet, ResNeXt, and ResNeSt. This comparison would have required the calculation of these metrics for each model, as well as the creation of any necessary visualizations to compare their performance.

In summary, while the specific postprocessing steps are not mentioned in the provided context, it can be inferred that the calculation of performance metrics and possibly the use of feature extraction or visualization techniques were a part of the postprocessing steps after model training.
