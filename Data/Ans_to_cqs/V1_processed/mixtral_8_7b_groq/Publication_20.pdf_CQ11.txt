Unfortunately, the provided context does not include a link to the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The context mentions a depository with architecture details, but it does not specify where this depository is located or how to access it. Therefore, I am unable to provide the requested link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
