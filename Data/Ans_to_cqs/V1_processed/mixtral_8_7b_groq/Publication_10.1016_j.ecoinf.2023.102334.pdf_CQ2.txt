The provided context discusses the use of Transformer models in computer vision, specifically for facial recognition of sika deer. However, it does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer based on the given context.

However, I can provide some general information about the data formats commonly used in deep learning. Deep learning models can handle various data formats, including but not limited to images, audio, video, and CSV files.

Images are typically used in computer vision tasks and are often in formats such as JPEG, PNG, or TIFF. Deep learning models can process these images by converting them into numerical representations, such as pixel values.

Audio data is used in speech recognition and natural language processing tasks and is usually in formats such as WAV or MP3. Deep learning models can process audio data by converting it into spectrograms or Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), which are numerical representations of the audio signal.

Video data is a sequence of images and is used in tasks such as action recognition and video analysis. Video data can be in formats such as MP4 or AVI. Deep learning models can process video data by extracting frames and processing them as images or by using 3D convolutions to process the video as a 3D tensor.

CSV files are used in tasks such as regression, classification, and natural language processing. CSV files contain tabular data, with each row representing a data point and each column representing a feature. Deep learning models can process CSV files by converting them into numerical representations, such as arrays or matrices.

In summary, deep learning models can handle various data formats, including images, audio, video, and CSV files. However, the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline depend on the task and the deep learning model.
