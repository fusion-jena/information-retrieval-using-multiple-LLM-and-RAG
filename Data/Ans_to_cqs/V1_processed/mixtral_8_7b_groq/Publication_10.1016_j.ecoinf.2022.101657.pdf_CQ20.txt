The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of specific hardware resources such as GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) or TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) for training the deep learning model. However, it does discuss the implementation of neural networks on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) for low power consumption.

In section 7.1.4, it is stated that hardware implementations of neural networks offer improved power efficiency over software-based alternatives and have the potential to reduce the overall systemâ€™s power consumption. The example given is the implementation of a Multilayer Perceptron model on an FPGA, which was shown to run in a similar time frame to a software-based approach but at a clock speed lower by a factor of 144, indicating a potential for lower power consumption or improved performance.

Furthermore, it is mentioned that the use of FPGAs allows for customizability of the system as it is programmable hardware, and it could be possible to implement the majority of the system with FPGAs, so a much lower power processor could be used for remaining tasks such as networking and human interaction.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of GPUs or TPUs for training the deep learning model, it does discuss the implementation of neural networks on FPGAs for low power consumption and customizability.
