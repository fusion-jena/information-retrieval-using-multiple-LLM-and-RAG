Based on the provided context, the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly stated. The text focuses on the use of unsupervised learning, where data labels are not utilized during the training of a generative model. Instead, the model is employed to extract features from both training and testing data, which are then used to train a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for classification.

However, the context does mention the use of a deep learning pipeline for classifying fish events, which implies that some form of data annotation was performed before the unsupervised learning stage. Common data annotation techniques for object detection and classification in deep learning include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest in an image. The bounding boxes provide the coordinates of the objects, allowing the model to learn their location and size.

2. Instance segmentation: In this method, each object in an image is segmented and labeled individually. This provides a more precise representation of the object's shape and location compared to bounding box annotation.

3. Semantic segmentation: This technique involves dividing an image into multiple regions based on the object classes present in each region. Unlike instance segmentation, semantic segmentation does not differentiate between individual objects of the same class.

4. Class balancing: When dealing with imbalanced datasets, techniques like oversampling the minority class, undersampling the majority class, or using class weights can help improve model performance.

Given the context, it is possible that one or more of these data annotation techniques were used before the unsupervised learning stage. However, the text does not provide enough information to determine which techniques were specifically employed.
