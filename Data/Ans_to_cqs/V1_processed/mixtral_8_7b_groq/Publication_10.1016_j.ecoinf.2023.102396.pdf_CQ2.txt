Based on the provided context, the data format used in the specific studies mentioned is not explicitly stated as being related to deep learning or specific data formats such as image, audio, video, or CSV. However, I can provide some general information about data formats commonly used in deep learning.

In deep learning, data formats can vary widely depending on the specific task and type of data being used. Some common data formats include:

1. Images: Deep learning has been widely applied to image recognition and analysis tasks. In these cases, data is often provided in the form of image files, such as JPEG or PNG.
2. Audio: Deep learning has also been used for audio analysis tasks, such as speech recognition or music information retrieval. In these cases, data is often provided in the form of audio files, such as WAV or MP3.
3. Video: Deep learning has been used for video analysis tasks, such as object detection or action recognition. In these cases, data is often provided in the form of video files, such as MP4 or AVI.
4. CSV: Deep learning can also be applied to tabular data, such as data stored in CSV (Comma Separated Values) format. This type of data is often used in regression or classification tasks.

In the studies mentioned in the context, the data format is not explicitly stated. However, based on the keywords and abstract, it appears that the studies are focused on analyzing time series data related to animal population dynamics. The data format for time series data is often a numerical file, such as CSV, where each row represents a data point at a specific point in time.

Therefore, while the specific data format used in the studies mentioned is not explicitly stated, it is likely that the data is provided in a numerical format such as CSV.
