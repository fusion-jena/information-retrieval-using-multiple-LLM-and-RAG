The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific cloud platform used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it does refer to the use of cloud computing capabilities for geospatial computations and the development of Google Earth Engine (GEE) as a platform for analyzing large amounts of satellite data. Therefore, it is possible that the deep learning model was deployed on Google Cloud Platform, since GEE is a part of it. But, we cannot be certain without more specific information.
 
The specific cloud platform used to deploy the deep learning model is not specified in the provided context. It only mentions the use of cloud computing capabilities and the development of Google Earth Engine (GEE) as a platform for analyzing satellite data. So, the answer is: The cloud platform used to deploy the deep learning model is not mentioned in the provided context.
