The pieces of context provided do not directly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipelines. However, they do give some insight into the types of datasets used in object detection and counting tasks.

In the first reference, the "Learning to Count Objects in Images" paper, the authors use the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset, which provides annotated objects with bounding boxes. This suggests that bounding box annotation is one technique used in deep learning pipelines.

The second and fifth references introduce the "Aerial Elephant Dataset," which is used for aerial object detection. While the context does not explicitly mention the annotation technique, the dataset's purpose implies the use of instance segmentation or, less likely, semantic segmentation. Instance segmentation involves labeling each object instance in an image, while semantic segmentation assigns a class label to each pixel in an image. Since the goal is to detect and count individual elephants, instance segmentation would be the more appropriate annotation technique.

The sixth reference, "Towards Perspective-free Object Counting with Deep Learning," mentions the use of the "TotA" dataset, which contains images annotated with object dots. This technique, referred to as "dot annotation," is another way to label objects in images for counting tasks.

In summary, based on the provided context, deep learning pipelines for object detection and counting tasks use bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, and dot annotation.
