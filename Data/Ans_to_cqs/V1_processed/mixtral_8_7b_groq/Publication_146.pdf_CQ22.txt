The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including precision, recall, F1 score, GIoU (Generalized Intersection over Union), and mAP (mean Average Precision).

Precision, recall, and F1 score are used to measure the model's detection performance. Precision is a measure of how accurate the model is at making positive predictions, i.e., objects detected by the model. Recall, on the other hand, measures how much is detected out of what should have been detected. It accounts for false negatives, i.e., objects not detected. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that encapsulates both.

During the training of the model, precision and recall values vary at different stages. Initially, the precision is likely to remain high as long as very few objects are detected. However, recall accounts for this by measuring false negatives. These two measures often move in tandem, and a high value for both indicates good detection performance.

The GIoU (Generalized Intersection over Union) is another metric used to evaluate the model's performance. It measures the correctness of the model's location predictions. A lower GIoU value indicates that the model is becoming better at correctly locating targets.

Lastly, mAP (mean Average Precision) is a metric used to evaluate the model's performance in object detection tasks. It calculates the average precision value for all relevant classes. A higher mAP score indicates better object detection performance.

In summary, the deep learning model's performance is evaluated using precision, recall, F1 score, GIoU, and mAP. These metrics provide a comprehensive view of the model's detection and location prediction capabilities.
