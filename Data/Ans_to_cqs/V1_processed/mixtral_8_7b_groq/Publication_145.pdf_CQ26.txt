Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, the text does mention the use of data augmentation as a technique to increase the amount of training data and improve model performance.

Data augmentation involves applying random transformations to the input images, including rotations, horizontal and vertical flips, and changes in brightness, saturation, and hue. This technique can help increase the variability of the training data and reduce overfitting, but it does not directly address data bias.

In terms of addressing data bias, stratified sampling is a technique that involves dividing the data into subgroups based on certain characteristics, such as class labels, and then ensuring that each subgroup is represented proportionally in both the training and validation sets. This can help ensure that the model is trained on a diverse and representative sample of the data, reducing the risk of bias.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques that involve adjusting the class frequencies in the training data to address imbalanced classes. Oversampling involves duplicating samples from the minority class, while undersampling involves removing samples from the majority class. These techniques can help improve model performance on imbalanced datasets, but they can also lead to overfitting and increased computational cost.

Diverse data collection involves gathering data from a wide range of sources and ensuring that the data is representative of the target population. This can help reduce bias and improve model performance, particularly in cases where the data is collected from a limited or non-representative sample.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of techniques to address data bias during preprocessing, it does mention the use of data augmentation as a technique to increase the variability of the training data. Other techniques, such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, can also be used to address data bias and improve model performance, but are not mentioned in the provided context.
