The deep learning model used in the pipeline, as described in the Wang et al. (2023) paper, is a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network. This model combines the strengths of two deep learning architectures: convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a category of deep learning models primarily used for processing grid-like data, such as images. They are particularly effective in extracting spatial features from data.

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, on the other hand, are a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) designed to handle sequential data by learning long-term dependencies. LSTMs have a special structure that allows them to maintain a form of 'memory,' which helps them capture important information from the past.

The ConvLSTM network, as used in the Wang et al. (2023) paper, takes advantage of both architectures. It uses convolutional layers to extract spatial features from the data, followed by LSTM layers to capture temporal dependencies. This combination makes it particularly suitable for processing sequential data with spatial correlations, such as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) dataset studied in the paper.

It's also worth noting that the ConvLSTM model in the Wang et al. (2023) paper is enhanced with an improved attention mechanism and models recombined by a genetic algorithm. These additional components aim to further improve the model's performance in forecasting ENSO.

In summary, the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network, which combines the strengths of CNNs and LSTMs to process sequential data with spatial correlations.
