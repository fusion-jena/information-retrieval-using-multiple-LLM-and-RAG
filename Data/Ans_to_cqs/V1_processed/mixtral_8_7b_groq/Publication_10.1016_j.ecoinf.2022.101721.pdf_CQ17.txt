The provided context does not contain direct information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. However, it does mention the use of machine learning for species identification and the use of R-code, which can be used for statistical computing and implementing various methods, including regularization techniques.

Regularization methods, such as dropout and L2 regularization, are commonly used in deep learning to prevent overfitting. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to make the model more robust and less prone to overfitting. L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages large weights and helps to reduce overfitting.

In the context of bat call detection and classification, overfitting can be a significant issue due to the complexity of the echolocation signals and the variability in the calls between different species. Regularization techniques can be used to prevent overfitting and improve the performance of the model.

To implement regularization techniques in the deep learning pipeline for bat call detection and classification, one can use various tools and libraries, such as Keras and TensorFlow, which provide built-in functions for dropout and L2 regularization. Additionally, one can use R-code and packages such as kerasR to implement these techniques in R.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, it is mentioned that machine learning is used for species identification, and regularization techniques such as dropout and L2 regularization can be used to prevent overfitting in deep learning models for bat call detection and classification.
