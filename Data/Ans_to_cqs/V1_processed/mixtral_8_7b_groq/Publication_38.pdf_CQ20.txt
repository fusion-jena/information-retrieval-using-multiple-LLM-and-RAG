The text does not provide explicit information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it does mention that some of the algorithms were run on an Intel i7 processor and a Nvidia GTX 1080 GPU. Given that the Nvidia GTX 1080 is a powerful graphics processing unit (GPU) commonly used for deep learning, it is likely that this GPU was used for training the deep learning model. However, without more specific information, this is just an educated guess.

It's worth noting that the use of GPUs for deep learning has become increasingly popular due to their ability to perform parallel processing, which makes them well-suited for the computationally intensive tasks involved in training deep learning models. GPUs can significantly reduce training times compared to using CPUs alone.

In summary, while the text does not explicitly state which hardware resources were used for training the deep learning model, it does mention the use of a Nvidia GTX 1080 GPU, which is commonly used for deep learning. Therefore, it is likely that this GPU was used for training the model.
