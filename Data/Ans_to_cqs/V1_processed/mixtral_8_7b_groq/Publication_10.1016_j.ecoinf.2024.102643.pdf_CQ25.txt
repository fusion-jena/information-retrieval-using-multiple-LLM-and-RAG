Based on the provided context, the specific deep learning model used is not mentioned. However, it is discussed that various machine learning models were used for analyzing and predicting species distributions and human-wildlife conflicts. These models include Maximum Entropy (MAXENT), Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), Generalized Boosted Model (GBM), Classification Tree Analyses (CTA), Flexible Discriminant Analysis (FDA), and Surface Response Envelope (SRE).

Deep learning models are a subset of machine learning models and are mainly used for handling large and complex datasets. Deep learning models are capable of learning from large datasets and extracting features automatically, which leads to better performance compared to traditional machine learning models. Deep learning models are mainly used for tasks such as classification, segmentation, object detection, and natural language processing.

Given the context of the study, it can be inferred that the deep learning model, if used, would have been used for a classification task. This is because the main objective of the study is to analyze and predict species distributions and human-wildlife conflicts, which involves categorizing data points into different classes.

In summary, based on the provided context, the specific deep learning model used is not mentioned. However, it can be inferred that if a deep learning model was used, it would have been used for a classification task, given the nature of the study.
