The context does not explicitly mention the specific criterion used to determine when the training of TrunkNet is complete. However, it does mention that the training loss converges after 65,000 iterations and takes approximately 11.5 hours. This suggests that the training may be set to stop after a certain number of iterations or a certain amount of time, regardless of the validation loss.

In general, training of deep learning models is often stopped when the validation loss plateaus or starts to increase, indicating that the model is overfitting to the training data. This is a common practice to prevent the model from memorizing the training data and improve its generalization performance.

In the context, the evaluation of TrunkNet is based on seven metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and F-measure, but it does not mention validation loss or accuracy. Therefore, it is unclear whether validation loss was used as a stopping criterion for training TrunkNet.

In summary, while the specific criterion used to determine when the training of TrunkNet is complete is not mentioned in the context, it is common practice to stop training when the validation loss plateaus or starts to increase.
