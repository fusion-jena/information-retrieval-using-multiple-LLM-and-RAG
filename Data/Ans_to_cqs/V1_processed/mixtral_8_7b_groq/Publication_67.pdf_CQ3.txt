The provided context discusses the construction and use of a database for training Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for classifying images based on tree cover levels. However, it does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

In general, data annotation techniques for deep learning models can include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation.

Bounding box annotation involves drawing a box around the object of interest in an image. This technique is commonly used for object detection tasks, where the goal is to locate and identify objects within an image.

Semantic segmentation involves labeling each pixel in an image with a class label. This technique is useful for image segmentation tasks, where the goal is to partition an image into multiple regions or segments, each corresponding to a specific class.

Instance segmentation is a more advanced technique that combines object detection and semantic segmentation. It involves not only labeling each pixel in an image with a class label, but also identifying and separating individual instances of each class.

Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the data annotation technique used in this deep learning pipeline is likely to be bounding box annotation or semantic segmentation, as the goal is to classify images based on tree cover levels. However, the specific technique used is not explicitly stated.

It is worth noting that the context mentions the use of a database of very high resolution satellite and aerial RGB images, which may have been pre-processed and annotated prior to being used in the deep learning pipeline. The specific methods used for pre-processing and annotation are not discussed in the provided context.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that bounding box annotation or semantic segmentation are likely to have been used based on the goal of classifying images based on tree cover levels. However, the specific technique used is not stated in the provided context.
