The context does not provide specific information about how the hyperparameters of the BEiT model are optimized. It mentions that an optimized model is used, but it doesn't detail the optimization process, including whether grid search, random search, or another method was used.

However, the context does mention a different model, CAHA-AXRNet, which optimizes hyperparameters through the crossover-boosted artificial hummingbird algorithm. This information is not directly related to the BEiT model's hyperparameter optimization, but it shows that the paper considers hyperparameter optimization important and employs advanced methods for it.

In summary, the context does not provide information on how the hyperparameters of the BEiT model are optimized.
