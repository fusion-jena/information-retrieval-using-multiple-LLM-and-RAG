The deep learning model in question is used for the purpose of water sun glint detection in UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) water images. This model is a modified version of the UNet convolutional neural network, enhanced with the Convolutional Block Attention Module and residual structures. The model is specifically designed to capture the distinctive semantic features associated with water sun glint.

The model is trained and evaluated using the WSGD (Water Sun Glint Detection) dataset, achieving high metrics in Accuracy, F1-score, and IOU (Intersection over Union). These results indicate the precision of the proposed method for water sun glint detection, offering valuable insights for effectively eliminating water sun glint and determining the optimal timing for UAV water image acquisition.

The model is compared with the current state-of-the-art model UNet, seed pixel region growing algorithm, and several classic semantic segmentation networks (PSPNet, HRNet, and UNet++). The results show that the Res_AUNet network achieved the best performance, followed by UNet and UNet++ networks. The F1-score and IOU of Res_AUNet network are significantly higher than those of HRNet and PSPNet, indicating the superiority of the proposed model in water sun glint detection.

In summary, the deep learning model Res_AUNet is designed for the specific task of water sun glint detection in UAV water images. The high metrics achieved in the evaluation and comparison with other models demonstrate the precision and effectiveness of the proposed method.
