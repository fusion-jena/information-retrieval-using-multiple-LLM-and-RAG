Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of measures such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some implications that suggest efforts towards this goal.

Firstly, the model was tested on different classification challenges, which involved various numbers of species. This could be seen as a form of implicit cross-validation, as the model's performance was evaluated across different tasks.

Secondly, the authors mentioned the use of a confusion matrix to evaluate the model's performance on Challenge 1. This is a common method for assessing the accuracy of a classification model, providing insights into both overall performance and per-class accuracy. The authors noted that the model achieved a 100% correct identification rate for 11 species and 90% or above for 17 species, indicating a degree of robustness.

Thirdly, the authors discussed the potential for 'fine-tuning' the model's automation of species recognition. This suggests an awareness of the need for adaptability and generalizability, as they acknowledge the potential utility of other means of restricting or limiting candidate species pools.

Lastly, the authors mentioned plans for future development, including application to additional taxonomic groups. This implies an intention to test the model's performance on a wider range of data, which could contribute to its generalizability.

In conclusion, while the text does not explicitly mention measures such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, there are indications that the authors have taken steps to ensure the model's generalizability. These include testing the model on different tasks, evaluating its performance using a confusion matrix, discussing the potential for fine-tuning, and planning future applications to diverse data.
