The provided context does not contain information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the description of CASE's database schema, data validation process, and data sources. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer based on the given information.

However, I can provide a general explanation of regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines:

Overfitting is a common issue in machine learning models, where the model learns the training data too well, including its noise, and performs poorly on unseen data. Regularization techniques are used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty to the loss function, which discourages the learning of overly complex models.

In deep learning, two common regularization methods are L2 regularization and dropout:

1. L2 regularization: This method adds a penalty term to the loss function, proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. By doing so, it encourages smaller weights, reducing the complexity of the model and preventing overfitting. L2 regularization is also known as weight decay or ridge regression.

2. Dropout: Dropout is a regularization technique specifically designed for neural networks. During training, dropout randomly sets a fraction of the neurons in a layer to zero, effectively preventing them from contributing to the forward propagation of that mini-batch. This process helps to break the co-adaptation of neurons, making the network more robust and less prone to overfitting.

These regularization techniques can be applied together or separately, depending on the specific deep learning pipeline and the dataset's characteristics.
