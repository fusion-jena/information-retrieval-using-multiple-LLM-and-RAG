The specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are not provided in the given context. However, it is mentioned that the authors used the default settings in YOLOv6, which implies that they used the recommended hyperparameters provided by the developers of the YOLOv6 model.

In general, hyperparameters are configuration variables that are set before the learning process begins. These variables determine the behavior of the learning algorithm and can significantly impact the model's performance. Some common hyperparameters used in deep learning models include learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, optimizer, and regularization parameters.

In the context provided, it is mentioned that the authors tested different sets of hyperparameters in YOLOv6 but found only marginal improvements. This suggests that they experimented with various hyperparameter configurations to optimize the model's performance. However, the specific hyperparameters used are not provided.

It is also mentioned that the authors tested working with different spatial resolutions of the imagery, including training runs in which the same images were used at different spatial resolutions. This approach is related to data preprocessing and is not a hyperparameter.

In summary, the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are not provided in the given context. However, it is mentioned that the authors used the default settings in YOLOv6, which implies that they used the recommended hyperparameters provided by the developers of the YOLOv6 model.
