Based on the provided context, there is no information about the specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the creation of fire risk maps using Landsat 8 satellite images and Jenks' natural break classification method in ArcGIS 10.6. It mentions performing atmospheric correction on the images in QGIS but does not mention any data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Data augmentation techniques like these are commonly used in deep learning to increase the amount of training data and improve model performance by creating variations of the original images, such as horizontally or vertically flipped images, rotated images, or scaled images. However, without specific information about the deep learning pipeline used in this study, it is not possible to provide a detailed answer to this query.
