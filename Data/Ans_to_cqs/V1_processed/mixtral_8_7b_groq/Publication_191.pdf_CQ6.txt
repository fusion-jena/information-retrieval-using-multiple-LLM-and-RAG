The provided context discusses the training of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model for plant species identification using the Caffe framework. However, it does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps applied to the data before training. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer based on the given context.

However, generally, when training deep learning models, several preprocessing steps are commonly involved, such as:

1. Data normalization: This involves scaling the input data to a similar range to improve the model's training efficiency and avoid bias towards certain features. In the context of image data, this could involve normalizing pixel values to a range between 0 and 1 or using mean subtraction and variance scaling.
2. Data augmentation: This technique is used to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset by applying random transformations to the existing data, such as rotation, scaling, flipping, and cropping. This helps improve the model's generalization ability and reduces overfitting.
3. Data cleaning: This involves removing or correcting any corrupted or irrelevant data points that could negatively impact the model's performance.
4. Feature extraction: In some cases, it may be necessary to extract relevant features from the raw data before training the model. For example, in the context of image data, this could involve extracting color histograms, texture features, or shape descriptors.

Therefore, while the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps, it is likely that some or all of these steps were applied to the PlantClef2015 dataset before training the deep CNN model.
