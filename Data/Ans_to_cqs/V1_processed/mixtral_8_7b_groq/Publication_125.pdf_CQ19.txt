The context provided does not give specific information about the deep learning frameworks used to build the CNN models. However, it is mentioned that the experiments were conducted on the Google Colab repository. Google Colab provides a runtime environment that supports popular deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. Given that these are the most widely used frameworks in the field of deep learning, it is likely that one of these was used to build the models. However, without explicit information, it is not possible to give a definitive answer.
