Based on the provided context, there is no information given about the specific location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on describing the four-layered architecture of the proposed deep learning framework for highway air quality monitoring and prediction, including the hardware layer, data storage layer, integration layer, and analytics layer. It also mentions the development of a baseline deep learning model for hourly predictions of PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 concentration levels. However, it does not provide details about where the code for this model is stored or hosted. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
