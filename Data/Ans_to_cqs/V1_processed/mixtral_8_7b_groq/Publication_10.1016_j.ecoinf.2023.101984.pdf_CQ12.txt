Based on the provided context, there is no information indicating that a deep learning model, such as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer, is used in the pipeline. The context refers to the use of the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) model for analyzing the output of a model, and the analysis of Mediterranean oaks, anthracology, Neolithic populations, and climate change. However, there is no mention of any deep learning models being used. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query as there is no information available in the given context.
