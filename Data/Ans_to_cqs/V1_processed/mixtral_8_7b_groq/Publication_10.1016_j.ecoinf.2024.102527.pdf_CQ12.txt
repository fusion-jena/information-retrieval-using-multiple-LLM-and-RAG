The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a ResNext-101 model, which is a member of the ResNeXt family of models. The ResNeXt model combines the advantages of the ResNet and InceptionV3 models, which are widely used for empty camera trap image recognition. The ResNeXt series models, including ResNext-101, exhibit a remarkably similar architecture to the ResNet series models that are extensively used for recognizing camera trap images. Therefore, the findings of ResNext-101 can be generalized to the ResNet family of models.

The ResNext-101 model is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is a popular deep learning model for image classification tasks. CNNs are designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from images, which makes them effective for image recognition tasks. The ResNext-101 model consists of several convolutional layers, followed by fully connected layers, which are used to classify the images based on the learned features.

In the pipeline, the ResNext-101 model is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, which is a large-scale dataset consisting of millions of images from thousands of classes. The pre-trained model is then transferred to the target domain datasets, such as SS or LSM, using different transfer learning strategies. The transfer learning strategies involve updating different layers of the DCNN model, such as Conv5 and FC layers, to enhance its performance in empty image recognition.

Therefore, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a ResNext-101 model, which is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed for image classification tasks.
