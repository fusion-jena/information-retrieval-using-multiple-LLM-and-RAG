The provided context does not give information about the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, generally, metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the curve (AUC) are commonly used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models.

Accuracy is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of input samples. Precision is the ratio of true positive predictions (relevant items that are correctly identified) to the sum of true positives and false positives (irrelevant items incorrectly identified as relevant). Recall is the ratio of true positive predictions to the sum of true positives and false negatives (relevant items incorrectly identified as irrelevant). F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, which gives equal weight to both measures. AUC measures the entire two-dimensional area underneath the entire ROC curve (receiver operating characteristic curve), from (0,0) to (1,1).

In the context of evaluating drought characteristics, the metrics used could be related to the accuracy of predicting drought severity, duration, and intensity. For example, the deep learning model's performance could be evaluated based on its ability to predict the percentage of regions experiencing drought (RED), the severity of drought (DS), and the duration of drought (DD). However, the provided context does not specify the use of any particular evaluation metric for the deep learning model.
