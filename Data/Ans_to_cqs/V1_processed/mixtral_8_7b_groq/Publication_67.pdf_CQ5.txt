The specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline described in the given context are not explicitly mentioned. However, it is mentioned that the datasets used are very high resolution satellite and aerial RGB images from two sources. Therefore, the datasets used are not standard datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, but rather custom datasets created for the specific purpose of training CNN-based models for cover classifications in global drylands.

The database construction phase involved creating five training datasets with different levels of tree cover, continuous and discrete approximations, and inclusion of an auxiliary "Non-Forest" class. These datasets were built by compiling a global database of very high resolution satellite and aerial RGB images from two sources.

The training phase involved training five CNN models based on Inception v.3 using two optimization techniques, transfer learning, and data augmentation. The models were trained on the five training datasets created in the database construction phase.

Therefore, while the specific datasets used are not named, they were created by compiling a global database of very high resolution satellite and aerial RGB images from two sources, and were designed specifically for the purpose of training CNN-based models for cover classifications in global drylands.
