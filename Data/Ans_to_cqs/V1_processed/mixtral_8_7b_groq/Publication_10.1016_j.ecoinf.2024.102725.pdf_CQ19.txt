Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the deep learning frameworks used in the studies mentioned. The context discusses various methods for NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) reconstruction and analysis, but it does not explicitly mention the use of deep learning models or the frameworks they are built on.

For instance, Wang et al. (2023) discuss deep-learning enhanced fusion methods for improved NDVI reconstruction, but they do not specify the deep learning framework used. Similarly, Wei et al. (2016), Zhou et al. (2015, 2021), Chu et al. (2021a), Chen et al. (2021), and Yao et al. (2023) focus on NDVI reconstruction methods, but they do not mention deep learning frameworks.

Moreover, the studies by Benedetti and Rossini (1993), Bermudez et al. (2018), and Charizanos and Demirhan (2023) do not involve deep learning models.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer this query.
