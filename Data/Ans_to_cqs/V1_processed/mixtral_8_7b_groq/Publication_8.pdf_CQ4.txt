In the context provided, the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for processing herbarium sheet images are not mentioned. However, it is mentioned that transfer learning was implemented, which involves using a pre-trained model on a different dataset (ImageNet) and fine-tuning it on the herbarium scan dataset.

In general, data augmentation techniques are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset, improve model performance, and reduce overfitting. Some common data augmentation techniques for image data include:

1. Flipping: This involves horizontally or vertically flipping the image, which can help the model learn invariance to image orientation.
2. Rotation: This involves rotating the image by a certain angle, which can help the model learn to recognize objects in different orientations.
3. Scaling: This involves changing the size of the image, which can help the model learn to recognize objects at different scales.
4. Translation: This involves shifting the image horizontally or vertically, which can help the model learn to recognize objects in different positions.
5. Color jittering: This involves changing the brightness, contrast, or saturation of the image, which can help the model learn to recognize objects under different lighting conditions.
6. Random erasing: This involves randomly erasing parts of the image, which can help the model learn to recognize objects even when parts of them are occluded.

These techniques can be applied on-the-fly during training, meaning that each epoch, the model sees a slightly different version of the training data. This helps the model generalize better and improves its performance on unseen data.
