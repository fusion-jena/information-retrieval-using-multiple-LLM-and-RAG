The hyperparameters of the model, such as depth (α), width (β), and resolution (γ), are optimized using a grid search operation in the context provided. The compound coefficient ϕ controls the available resources for model scaling, while the constants α, β, and γ determine the way to assign these extra resources to network width, depth, and resolution, respectively. These constants are determined by a grid search operation, which systematically searches through a specified range of values for each hyperparameter and identifies the combination that results in the best model performance.

The proposed approach for H. ovalis detection consists of four steps: dataset description, dataset processing and labelling, model training, and performance evaluation. In the model training step, the hyperparameters of the EfficientDet architecture are optimized using a grid search operation. The EfficientDet architecture uses a compound scaling method that adjusts the depth, width, and resolution of the model uniformly and dynamically based on the user-specified coefficient ϕ.

The compound scaling method is defined as d = αϕ for depth, w = βϕ for width, and r = γϕ for resolution, where α, β, and γ are constants determined by the grid search operation. The grid search operation searches through a range of values for each constant and identifies the combination that results in the best model performance.

The proposed approach uses the EfficientDet architecture, which is a backbone feature extractor that extracts features from the input data. The extracted features are then fed into the PANet for feature fusion. The head layer predicts the class, score, and location of the objects.

In summary, the hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a grid search operation that systematically searches through a specified range of values for each hyperparameter and identifies the combination that results in the best model performance. The compound scaling method is used to adjust the depth, width, and resolution of the model uniformly and dynamically based on the user-specified coefficient ϕ. The constants in the compound scaling method are determined by the grid search operation.
