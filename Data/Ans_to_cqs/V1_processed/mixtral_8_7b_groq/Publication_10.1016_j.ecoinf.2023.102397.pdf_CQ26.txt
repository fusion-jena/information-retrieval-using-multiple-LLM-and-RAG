Based on the provided context, there are a few techniques mentioned that can be used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, the specific techniques mentioned are not directly related to deep learning pipelines, but rather to the broader field of automated data processing in ecology.

One technique mentioned is the use of diverse data collection methods to avoid introducing new biases into the data. This is mentioned in the context of analyzing acoustic data for bird diversity, where it is noted that new biases may arise depending on the specificities of the choice of feature extraction (Towsey et al., 2012). Therefore, it is important to use diverse data collection methods to ensure that the data is representative of the population being studied.

Another technique mentioned is the evaluation of the quality and uncertainty of the algorithms used in the data processing pipeline. This is mentioned in the context of species distribution models and the evaluation of rangeland aboveground biomass, where it is noted that widely-used algorithms may not have the desired quality in certain situations (Munro et al., 2022; Kaveh et al., 2023). Therefore, it is important to continuously evaluate the quality and uncertainty of the algorithms used in the data processing pipeline to ensure that they are producing accurate and unbiased results.

While the context does not explicitly mention techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling, these techniques can be used to address data bias in a deep learning pipeline. Stratified splitting involves dividing the data into subsets based on certain criteria, such as class labels, to ensure that each subset is representative of the overall population. Oversampling involves increasing the number of instances of a particular class in the data to address class imbalance, while undersampling involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class to achieve the same goal.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling, it does highlight the importance of using diverse data collection methods and continuously evaluating the quality and uncertainty of the algorithms used in the data processing pipeline to address data bias in a deep learning pipeline.
