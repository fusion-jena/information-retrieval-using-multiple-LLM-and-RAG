The text provided does not give specific details about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention overfitting as a problem when using large deep learning networks with many parameters, such as ResNetV50 and InceptionNetV3. It also mentions that a very high F1-score was achieved by transfer learning on ResNetV50 using pretrained weights and only training the output layers.

Regularization methods, such as dropout and L2 regularization, are commonly used to prevent overfitting in deep learning models. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to prevent over-reliance on any one neuron and therefore overfitting. L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. This encourages smaller weights, which can help to prevent overfitting.

The text does not mention if these or any other regularization techniques were used in the deep learning pipeline. It is possible that they were used but not mentioned, or it could be that other methods were used to prevent overfitting. Without further information, it is not possible to give a definitive answer to this question.

Another potential source of error in the algorithm was the choice of dataset used for training and validation of the CNN model. The text mentions that collecting a sufficiently large dataset with enough data points for efficient classification of the rarer species was a significant challenge. It is possible that increasing the number of images available for training the CNN model could improve performance and prevent overfitting.

In summary, the text does not provide specific information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention overfitting as a problem when using large deep learning networks. Other potential sources of error in the algorithm include the choice of dataset and the padding of the bounding box before CNN prediction.
