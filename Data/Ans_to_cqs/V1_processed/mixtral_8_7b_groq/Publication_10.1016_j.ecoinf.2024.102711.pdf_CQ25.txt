The provided context does not explicitly state the specific purpose or type of the deep learning model used in the study, such as classification, segmentation, or detection. However, it does mention the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in section 2.6. GANs are a type of deep learning model typically used for generative tasks, such as image synthesis, data imputation, or style transfer.

In the context, GANs are not the primary focus of the study, and the authors mainly discuss the application of Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) for model selection, data pre-processing, and hyperparameter tuning. The deep learning model, which might be a GAN or another type of model, is used in conjunction with AutoML for these processes.

The authors mention the use of k-fold cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning, which is a common technique for evaluating model performance and selecting the best set of hyperparameters. They also discuss the issue of overfitting in ML modeling, which can occur when the learning dataset is relatively small. To mitigate this issue, the authors evaluate the model performance against an independent dataset, revealing a true model fit that is lower than the performance obtained against the model development dataset.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly state the purpose or type of the deep learning model used in the study, it suggests that the model might be a GAN or another type of deep learning model used for generative tasks. The primary focus of the study is on AutoML for model selection, data pre-processing, and hyperparameter tuning, with the deep learning model being used in conjunction with AutoML for these processes.
