The provided context discusses the use of a deep learning model for soundscape analysis, but it does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used, such as the learning rate or optimizer.

However, it does mention that the model uses a variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture, which typically involves the use of an optimizer like Adam or RMSprop, and a learning rate that is often set using techniques like learning rate schedules or learning rate decay.

Additionally, the model is described as using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with wide residual networks (WRNs) as the encoder and decoder. WRNs are a type of residual network that use wider layers to increase model capacity and complexity. The use of residual connections in these networks can affect the learning rate, as they can make the optimization landscape smoother and easier to optimize.

The encoder also includes a pre-processing block with a convolution using a wide receptive field (5 × 5 kernel) and signal coarsening along the time axis (2 × 1 kernel). The coarsening strategy involves recombining the concatenated output of 2 × 2 maximum and 2 × 2 average pooling using a 1 × 1 convolution.

Overall, while the specific hyperparameters used in the model are not provided in the context, it can be inferred that the model likely uses common hyperparameters for VAEs and deep CNNs, such as an Adam optimizer and a learning rate schedule. The use of WRNs and pre-processing blocks may also affect the choice of hyperparameters.
