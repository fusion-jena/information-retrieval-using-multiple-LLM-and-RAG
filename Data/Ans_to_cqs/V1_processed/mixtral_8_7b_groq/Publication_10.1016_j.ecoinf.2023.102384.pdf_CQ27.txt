Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the steps followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. However, we can infer some parts of the process based on the information given.

First, the data collection and curation phases involved annotating pests (whiteflies) and preparing a training set with bounding boxes, density maps, and segmentation maps generated from dot labels. The training step followed, using a model based on dilated convolutions. After training, a test split with eight images was used for model evaluation.

However, the context does not mention any steps related to deploying the trained model, like converting the model to a format suitable for deployment, selecting a platform for deployment, or integrating the model into an application or system.

Another possibility is that the provided context focuses on the methodology of the study, and the details of model deployment are not within the scope of the text. Thus, it is not possible to provide a complete and accurate answer based on the given context.

 I am unable to provide information on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, as the provided context does not contain details about model serialization, platform selection, or integration into an application or system.
