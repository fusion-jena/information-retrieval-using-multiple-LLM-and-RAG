The provided context does not contain specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model BERT (Devlin, J., Chang, M.-W., Lee, K., Toutanova, K., 2018). However, it is common for deep learning models to have hyperparameters such as learning rate, optimizer, batch size, number of layers, and number of units in each layer. The learning rate determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function, and the optimizer is the algorithm used to find the minimum. Common optimizers include stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop. The batch size is the number of training examples used in one iteration, and the number of layers and units in each layer determine the complexity of the model.

In the context of word embeddings, the CBOW algorithm used to generate the word space gen.de/z2/LSAspaces (GÃ¼nther et al., 2015) has hyperparameters such as vector size, context window size, and negative sampling rate. The vector size determines the dimensionality of the word vectors, the context window size determines the number of words considered when predicting a target word, and the negative sampling rate determines the proportion of negative samples (non-occurring word pairs) to positive samples (occurring word pairs) in the training data.

In the context of text mining and topic segmentation, the comparative study by Naili, Chaibi, and Ben Ghezala (2017) used word embeddings as features and evaluated various hyperparameters such as dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, t-SNE), clustering algorithms (K-means, DBSCAN), and similarity measures (cosine similarity, Jaccard similarity).

In summary, while the specific hyperparameters used in the BERT model are not provided in the context, deep learning models commonly have hyperparameters such as learning rate, optimizer, batch size, number of layers, and number of units in each layer. Word embeddings have hyperparameters such as vector size, context window size, and negative sampling rate. Text mining and topic segmentation have hyperparameters such as dimensionality reduction techniques, clustering algorithms, and similarity measures.
