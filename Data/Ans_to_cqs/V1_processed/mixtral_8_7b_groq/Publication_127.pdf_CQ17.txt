Deep learning models, like other machine learning algorithms, are prone to overfitting, especially when dealing with complex datasets or when the model has a large number of parameters. Regularization techniques are used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty to the loss function, which encourages the model to have simpler weights and avoid memorizing the training data.

Two common regularization methods used in deep learning are dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a regularization technique introduced by Srivastava et al. (2014) in the paper "Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting". Dropout works by randomly dropping out, or setting to zero, a fraction of the neurons in a layer during training. This prevents the neurons from co-adapting too much and leads to a more robust model. Dropout is typically applied to the fully connected layers in a deep learning model.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is a method that adds a penalty term to the loss function, proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This encourages the model to have smaller weights, reducing overfitting. L2 regularization is applied to all the weights in the model, including the convolutional filters in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

These regularization techniques can be used together in a deep learning model. For example, the ResNet architecture (He et al., 2016) uses both dropout and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.

In summary, dropout and L2 regularization are two common regularization techniques used in deep learning to prevent overfitting. Dropout randomly drops out a fraction of the neurons in a layer during training, while L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. These techniques can be used together in a deep learning model to improve its generalization performance.
