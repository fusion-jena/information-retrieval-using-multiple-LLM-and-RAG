The provided context discusses a study that proposes a deep learning model called SeedNet for seed classification and retrieval, but it does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps applied to the images before training the model. However, it is common practice in deep learning to apply certain preprocessing techniques to improve model performance and ensure the data is in a suitable format for the model.

Some common preprocessing steps for image data in deep learning include:

1. Image normalization: This involves scaling the pixel values of the image to a range between 0 and 1. This helps to stabilize the learning process during training and can improve model convergence.
2. Image augmentation: This technique involves creating modified versions of the original images by applying random transformations such as rotation, scaling, flipping, and cropping. Image augmentation can help increase the size of the training dataset, reduce overfitting, and improve the model's ability to generalize to new images.
3. Data cleaning: This step involves removing any irrelevant or corrupted images from the dataset. It is essential to ensure that the training data is clean and free from errors or inconsistencies.
4. Data splitting: This involves dividing the dataset into separate subsets for training, validation, and testing. This helps to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data and prevent overfitting.

While the provided context does not mention these specific preprocessing steps, it does mention that the input image size is 224 × 224 × 3, which suggests that some form of image resizing or cropping was applied to the original images. Additionally, the use of a Max pooling strategy with a 3 × 3 filter size and 1 × 1 stride implies that some form of image downsampling was employed to reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps applied to the images before training the SeedNet model, it is common practice in deep learning to apply techniques such as image normalization, augmentation, cleaning, and splitting to improve model performance.
