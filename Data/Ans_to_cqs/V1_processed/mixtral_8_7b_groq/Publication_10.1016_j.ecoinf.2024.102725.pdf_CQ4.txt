Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling being applied in a deep learning pipeline for NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data. Data augmentation is a common technique used in deep learning to increase the amount of training data and improve model performance by applying random transformations to the existing data.

However, the context does mention several methods used for reconstructing NDVI time series data, including the Savitzky-Golay filter (Chen et al., 2004), Harmonic ANalysis of time Series (HANTS) (Zhou et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2021), and an adaptive spatial-temporal tensor completion method (ST Sensor) (Chu et al., 2021a). These methods focus on addressing missing data or weather-related occlusions in NDVI data, rather than data augmentation.

Therefore, based on the provided context, data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling do not appear to have been applied in the deep learning pipeline for NDVI data.
