I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the necessary information about the data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context mainly discusses the structure of a specific feature pyramid network (FPN) based on ResNet152 and its application in deer survey from drone thermal imagery using an enhanced Faster R-CNN model. However, it does not mention or provide a link to any data repository for the deep learning pipeline. I hope this information is helpful, and I'm sorry that I couldn't provide the exact answer to your query.
