The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the raw data used in the study consists of text data from tweets, which suggests the possibility of using APIs or web scraping techniques to collect data from social media platforms.



The raw data used in the study consists of text data from tweets, as indicated in the context. However, the specific methods used for collecting this data are not mentioned. It can be inferred that the data was collected using APIs or web scraping techniques from social media platforms.

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are tools that allow developers to access data from a platform or service programmatically. Many social media platforms provide APIs that allow developers to collect data from the platform, such as tweets from Twitter.

Web scraping is a technique used to extract data from websites by programmatically browsing the site and extracting relevant information. This technique can be used to collect data from social media platforms that do not provide APIs or to collect data that is not available through APIs.

In addition to APIs and web scraping, other methods for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines include surveys, sensors, and public datasets. Surveys are a common method for collecting data from human subjects, while sensors can be used to collect data from physical environments. Public datasets are often used in deep learning research, as they provide large amounts of data that can be used for training and testing models.

Overall, while the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline are not mentioned in the provided context, it can be inferred that APIs or web scraping techniques were used to collect text data from tweets. Other methods for collecting raw data include surveys, sensors, and public datasets.
