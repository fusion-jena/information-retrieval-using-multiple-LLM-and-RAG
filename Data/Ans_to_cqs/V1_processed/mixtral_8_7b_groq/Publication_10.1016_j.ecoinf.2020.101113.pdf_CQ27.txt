The text provided gives some information about the training of the deep learning model, but it does not explicitly describe the process of deploying the trained model. However, based on common practices in deep learning model deployment, we can make some educated guesses about the steps that might have been taken.

First, once the ResNet50 model was trained on the soundscape recordings, the model would need to be serialized or saved to disk so that it could be loaded and used in other applications. Model serialization is an important step in deep learning model deployment because it allows researchers and developers to share their models with others, and it enables models to be used in a variety of different platforms and environments.

After the model has been serialized, the next step would be to choose a platform for deploying the model. The text mentions that the model was trained with the goal of expanding the approach to the broader community, which suggests that the model might be intended for use in a variety of different settings. There are many different platforms available for deep learning model deployment, including cloud-based platforms like AWS SageMaker and Google Cloud AI Platform, as well as edge computing platforms like TensorFlow Lite and ONNX Runtime.

Once a platform has been chosen, the serialized model would need to be loaded onto the platform and integrated into an application or workflow. This might involve writing code to load the model and make predictions, or it might involve using a pre-built tool or library to simplify the deployment process.

Overall, while the text does not provide specific details about the process of deploying the trained deep learning model, we can infer that the model was likely serialized and then loaded onto a platform for use in applications or workflows. The choice of platform would depend on the specific requirements of the application and the intended audience for the model.
