The provided context does not contain information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The text focuses on the methodology and results of land use and land cover classification using SPOT6 satellite data and different deep learning architectures. It mentions the preprocessing of data, splitting it into learning, validation, and test sets, and the selection of the best-performing "single-pixel" and "semantic labeling" architectures for the remainder of the study. However, it does not provide details about the deployment platform.
