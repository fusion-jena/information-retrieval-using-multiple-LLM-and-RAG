Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps applied after model training, such as saliency maps or confusion matrix calculation. However, the context does mention the use of certain metrics for evaluating model performance.

In the context, early stopping is mentioned as a postprocessing step for preventing overfitting in the machine learning models. Early stopping involves monitoring the validation statistic during the training process and halting the training when adding more trees or layers does not improve the validation statistic. In this case, the validation statistic used was the R2 value for a continuous response.

Additionally, the results section mentions that the best machine learning model for predicting CLCuD was the Bagged Subspace Forest (BSF) model. The BSF model was selected based on statistical and machine learning methods, but the specific evaluation metrics used are not provided.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention saliency maps or confusion matrix calculation, it does mention the use of early stopping for preventing overfitting and the evaluation of model performance using certain metrics.
