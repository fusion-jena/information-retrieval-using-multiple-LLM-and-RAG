The provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses various experiments and comparisons of VGG16 and ResNet models applied to bird and amphibian vocalizations, but it does not mention where the data or code for the pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
