In the context provided, there is information about how data was split for a specific artificial neural network (ANN) model, but it does not provide general criteria for splitting data for deep learning model training. However, I can describe the approach used in this particular case.

The data was divided into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. The training set consisted of 70% of the data, the validation set was 15%, and the testing set was also 15%. This means that out of the total data, 70% was used to train the model, 15% to validate the model during the training process, and the remaining 15% was used to test the model's performance after training.

The purpose of splitting the data this way is to ensure that the model is not overfitting to the training data and can generalize well to unseen data. The training set is used to optimize the model's parameters, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final model performance.

In summary, while the context does not provide general criteria for splitting data for deep learning model training, it does describe a common approach: splitting the data into training, validation, and testing sets, with typical proportions being 70%, 15%, and 15%, respectively. This approach helps ensure that the model can generalize well to unseen data and prevents overfitting to the training data.
