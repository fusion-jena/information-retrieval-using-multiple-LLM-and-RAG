I'm sorry, but the provided context does not include information about the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses a study involving Whale Time-Frequency Hidden Markov Model (WT-HMM) and its performance with varying dataset sizes in cetacean vocalization classification. However, it does not mention where the data repository is available. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
