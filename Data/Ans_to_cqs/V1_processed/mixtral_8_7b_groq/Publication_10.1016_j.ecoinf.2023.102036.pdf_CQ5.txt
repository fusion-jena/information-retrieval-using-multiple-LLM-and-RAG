The provided context does not mention any specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet that are used in the deep learning pipeline for ecological applications. However, it does mention that the deep learning techniques are used for identifying and classifying individuals based on photographs. This implies that the dataset used would likely include photographs as the input data.

The context also states that due to the small amount of labeled images in each category, the researchers "exploit existing deep learning techniques in combination with statistical fundamentals" to overcome the limitation of the dataset size. This suggests that the dataset used may not be a standard one, but rather a custom dataset created for the specific ecological application.

In addition, the context highlights the use of deep learning techniques in ecology for a wide range of topics such as identification of animal species and estimation of biodiversity in large datasets. Therefore, it is possible that different datasets are used for different ecological applications of deep learning.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention any specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for ecological applications, it implies that custom datasets of photographs are used and that different datasets may be used for different ecological applications.
