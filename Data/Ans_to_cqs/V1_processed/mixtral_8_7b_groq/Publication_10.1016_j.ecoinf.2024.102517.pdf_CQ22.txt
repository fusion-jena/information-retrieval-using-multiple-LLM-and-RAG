The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model for bird sound noise reduction. However, it does mention some other metrics that are used for evaluation.

The authors use the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as a metric to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The SNR is a measure of the power of a signal relative to the power of the noise. A higher SNR indicates better noise reduction.

Additionally, the authors use the perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) as a metric. The PESQ is a widely used objective measure of voice quality and is standardized in ITU-T Recommendation P.862.2. It predicts the subjective quality of a degraded speech signal in a mean opinion score (MOS) scale, ranging from 1 (bad) to 5 (excellent).

Furthermore, the authors use the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) as a metric. The PSNR is a measure of the quality of reconstruction of lossy compression codecs (e.g., for image compression). It is most easily defined via the mean squared error (MSE) of the signal as distortion measure:

PSNR = 20 \* log10(MAX\_POSSIBLE\_PIXEL\_VALUE) - 10 \* log10(MSE)

where MAX\_POSSIBLE\_PIXEL\_VALUE is the maximum possible pixel value of the image, and MSE is the mean squared error between the original and the compressed image.

Therefore, the answer is that the provided context mentions the use of SNR, PESQ, and PSNR as metrics to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model for bird sound noise reduction.
