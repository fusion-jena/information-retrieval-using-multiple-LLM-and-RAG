The provided context discusses the use of deep learning in image classification, specifically for camera trap images in wildlife surveys. However, it does not directly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value.

In the context, it is mentioned that the training process uses the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method, which has a certain randomness resulting in a slight difference in training time. To mitigate this randomness, the study employs an adaptive incremental training method, which includes both the initial training and incremental training processes. The initialization parameters of the model for incremental training are produced by the previously trained model rather than randomly. This approach may help reduce the impact of randomness in the training process by building on the knowledge gained from the previous training phase.

However, the context does not explicitly discuss other strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a fixed random seed value for reproducibility. Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
