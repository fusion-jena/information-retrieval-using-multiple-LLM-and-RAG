The context provided does not give specific criteria used to determine when training of the model is complete. However, it mentions that the model was further trained, a technique known as transfer-learning, using the WCS dataset and its recommended data split. This further training was done after the model was pre-trained on the MS-COCO dataset. The training process resulted in a credible mean average precision (mAP50) score of 0.75.

The mAP metric takes the mean over all considered species of their respective, species-specific average precision. The subscript 50 refers to the requirement that the area of the intersection of the ground truth bounding box and predicted bounding box needs to be at least 50% of the area of the union of both for an otherwise true species identification to be considered correct.

The network outputs a belief value for species identification, and thresholding these values produces the final species identification. However, the criteria used to determine when to stop the training process are not specified in the context. It is possible that the training was stopped based on a validation loss plateau or other convergence criteria, but this information is not provided.
