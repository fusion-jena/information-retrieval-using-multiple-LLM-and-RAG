Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the study uses a spectrogram image classification approach for boatwhistle call detection.

In this context, the data annotation process might involve labeling spectrogram images instead of bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The spectrogram images are likely labeled as 'boatwhistle' or 'other' classes. The 'other' class represents false alarms identified by the detection stage.

The labeled dataset was split into training and testing datasets, with 50% of the training data held out for validation. The final classification model, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a cubic polynomial kernel, was trained using the ResNet-50 fc1000 activations of the full training dataset.

To summarize, while the context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques, it can be inferred that the study uses spectrogram image labeling for the deep learning pipeline.
