The text provided discusses several techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, specifically in the context of imbalanced datasets.

One method is stratified splitting, although it is not explicitly mentioned in the text, it can be inferred as a preprocessing step. Stratified splitting is a technique used during train-test splitting to ensure that the distribution of classes in the training and test sets remains similar to that of the original dataset. This can help ensure that the model is exposed to a representative sample of each class during training.

Undersampling and oversampling are two other techniques mentioned in the text. Undersampling involves randomly removing samples from the majority classes to reduce their influence during training, while oversampling involves duplicating samples from the minority classes to increase their representation. However, these methods can lead to loss of information (in the case of undersampling) or overfitting (in the case of oversampling).

A more sophisticated approach is the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), which generates synthetic samples based on the feature space and combining features from neighboring samples in the minority classes. This technique helps to augment the dataset without simply duplicating existing samples, thus reducing the risk of overfitting. SMOTE has been effectively applied in ecological informatics studies where imbalanced data is common.

Lastly, diverse data collection can also be a strategy to address data bias. By collecting a wide variety of data, representing all classes equally, the model can learn a more generalized representation of the data, reducing bias towards any particular class.

In summary, the text discusses several techniques to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, including stratified splitting, undersampling, oversampling, SMOTE, and diverse data collection. The choice of technique depends on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the problem at hand.
