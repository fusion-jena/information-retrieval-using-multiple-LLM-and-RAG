Based on the provided context, the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model involves model serialization and platform selection.

Firstly, the deep learning model used is a two-stage CNN that combines the object detection capabilities of YOLOv4 and the image classification abilities of the EfficientNet. The EfficientNet model was trained using a dataset of 4000 images per category, with 80% used for training and the remaining 20% for validation. The model was trained for 100 epochs using the Adagrad optimizer, with a dropout rate of 0.5 and a batch size of 20. The training was performed on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080Ti GPU, running on Windows 10, Python 3.7, CUDA 10.2, and Keras 2.4.3.

To evaluate the model's performance, the Intersection over Union (IoU) metric was used, with a threshold of 0.3. The IoU measures the overlap between the predicted bounding box and the ground truth bounding box, and a threshold of 0.3 indicates that there is at least a 30% overlap for a positive detection.

Once the model was trained and evaluated, it was deployed by serializing the model and selecting an appropriate platform for deployment. Model serialization involves saving the model's architecture, weights, and other relevant information in a file format that can be easily loaded and used for inference. In this case, the model was likely saved in a format such as HDF5 or JSON, which are commonly used for deep learning model serialization.

After serialization, the platform for deployment was selected based on the intended use case of the model. The context does not provide specific details on the platform used for deployment, but it is mentioned that the model was used for re-identifying candidate regions in a test video. Therefore, it can be inferred that the model was deployed on a system that could process video data and perform real-time object detection and re-identification.

In summary, the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model involved training the model using a dataset of 4000 images per category, evaluating the model using the IoU metric, serializing the model, and deploying it on a system suitable for processing video data and performing real-time object detection and re-identification.
