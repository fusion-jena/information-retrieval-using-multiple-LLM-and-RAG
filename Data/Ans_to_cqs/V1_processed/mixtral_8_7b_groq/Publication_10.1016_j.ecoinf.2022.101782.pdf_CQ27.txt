The provided context does not give detailed information on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model was trained using a batch size of 64, an ADAM optimizer, and a learning rate of 10. The model was trained on image data that was augmented through horizontal flips, random shears, and zooms. The data was normalized to ImageNet mean values and rescaled to be within the range of [0, 1]. The best model was selected based on the minimal validation loss that occurred at epoch 448.

As for the deployment of the model, the context only mentions that the model's performance was evaluated based on an independent test set of 2060 images. It does not provide information on how the model was integrated into a larger system or made available for use in applications.

Therefore, I cannot provide a complete answer to the query. However, I can say that the process of deploying a deep learning model typically involves serializing the model so that it can be saved and loaded efficiently, and selecting an appropriate platform for deployment. This may involve deploying the model on a server or cloud infrastructure, or integrating it into a mobile or web application. Additional steps may include optimizing the model for the target platform, testing the model in the deployment environment, and monitoring its performance over time.
