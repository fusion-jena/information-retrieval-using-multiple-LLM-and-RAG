Based on the provided context, there is no information about the use of standard deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, there are several studies that utilize various datasets related to remote sensing, ecology, and multispectral/hyperspectral imaging.

1. AVIRIS-NG imaging spectroscopy dataset: Used by Zhang et al. (Ecological Informatics 81(2024)1026053) for analyzing and predicting ecological informatics using ensemble machine learning.
2. Finger millet dataset: Used by Baath et al. (Front. Agron. 2 (2021)) for detecting biophysical characteristics and nitrogen status at hyperspectral and multispectral resolutions.
3. Zostera noltii dataset: Used by Bargain et al. (J. Exp. Mar. Biol. Ecol. 2013) for studying seasonal spectral variation and its influence on pigment-based vegetation indices.
4. Dendroctonus valens infestation dataset: Used by Bingtao et al. (Remote Sens. 15) for early detection of dendroctonus valens infestation at the tree level with a hyperspectral UAV image.
5. UAV multispectral features dataset: Used by Zhang et al. (Forests 13 (12), 2104-2104) for analyzing damage caused by Erannis jacobsoni Djak. to Siberian elm (Sibirica Ledeb.).
6. Sentinel-2 dataset: Used by Binxiang et al. (Agriculyural and Forest Meteorology, 322) for developing a triangular vegetation index for chlorophyll content estimation.
7. Forest disease spread dataset: Used by Liu et al. (Remote Sens. Environ. 101, 167â€“180) for monitoring forest disease spread using multi-temporal high spatial resolution imagery.

These datasets are specific to the studies mentioned and are not standard deep learning datasets. However, they showcase the application of machine learning and remote sensing in various ecological and agricultural contexts.
