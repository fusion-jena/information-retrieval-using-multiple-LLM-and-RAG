The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves increasing the weighting given to the no-object component of the multipart loss function and using transfer learning with the pretrained general-purpose YOLO object detector as a starting point. The aerial images used for training are split into 12 equal-sized tiles to help volunteers count the wildebeest more accurately, as they initially struggled with counting entire aerial images due to their large size and high resolution.

During training, the authors first froze all layers of the YOLO object detector and trained the model on the COCO dataset. After that, they unfroze some of the layers to allow for fine-tuning on the specific task of counting wildebeest in aerial images. By increasing the weighting given to the no-object component of the loss function, the model is encouraged to pay more attention to correctly identifying and counting wildebeest, rather than focusing on other objects in the image.

The authors used a combination of human and machine-based methods to count the wildebeest in the survey images. They found that both methods were capable of producing highly accurate image counts, with the deep learning approach providing a more efficient and consistent method for counting wildebeest. However, they also acknowledge that the filtering of data, image resolution, and the set of volunteers participating in the project can affect the accuracy of the counts.

In summary, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves a combination of transfer learning, adjusting the loss function, and splitting the aerial images into smaller tiles. These techniques help ensure that the model is accurately identifying and counting wildebeest in the survey images, providing a more efficient and consistent method for monitoring the wildebeest population in the Serengeti.
