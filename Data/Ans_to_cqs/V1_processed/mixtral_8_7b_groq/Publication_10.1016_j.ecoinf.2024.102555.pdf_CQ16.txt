Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The context consists of various studies related to the use of remote sensing, tree rings, and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) to analyze topographic patterns of forest decline, vegetation cover variations, and ecological restoration. While these studies discuss the materials and methods used for data collection and analysis, they do not provide details about the training and validation process for machine learning models or the criteria used to determine when training is complete.

In general, when training machine learning models, various criteria can be used to determine when training is complete, such as:

1. Validation loss plateau: Training can be considered complete when the validation loss stops decreasing or reaches a plateau, indicating that the model has learned the underlying patterns in the training data and is not overfitting.
2. Early stopping: Training can be stopped early if the validation loss starts increasing, indicating that the model is overfitting to the training data.
3. Patience: Training can be stopped if the validation loss does not improve for a certain number of epochs or iterations, indicating that further training is unlikely to improve the model's performance.
4. Learning rate: Training can be stopped when the learning rate becomes too small, indicating that the model has converged to a minimum.

These criteria can be used in combination or separately, depending on the specific problem and the machine learning algorithm being used. However, the provided context does not contain information about the criteria used in the studies mentioned.
