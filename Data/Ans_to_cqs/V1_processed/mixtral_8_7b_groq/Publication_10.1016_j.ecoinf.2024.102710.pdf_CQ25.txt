The deep learning models mentioned in the provided context serve different purposes. BirdNET, as described in Kahl et al. (2021), is a deep learning solution for avian diversity monitoring, suggesting that it is used for classification tasks, identifying different bird species from audio data.

In the context of medical image computing, the paper by Kadir, Alam, and Sonntag (2023) discusses an edge estimation-based active learning approach for OCT segmentation. This implies that the deep learning model in this context is used for segmentation tasks, identifying and separating different parts or edges of medical images.

The works by Swaminathan et al. (2024) and Lauha et al. (2022) evaluate transfer learning models based on classification performance. Therefore, the deep learning models in these studies are used for classification tasks, categorizing data into different classes.

McGinn et al. (2023) investigate the topology of fine-grained, sub-species sound events in the embedding space afforded by BirdNet. They find that different call types of a same species form distinct clusters. This suggests that the BirdNet model in this study is used for embedding tasks, converting high-dimensional data into a form that can be easily analyzed.

The UMAP plots in Fig. 4 are generated for different embedding layers of different embedding models for AnuraSet. UMAP is a dimensionality reduction technique used for visualization. Therefore, the deep learning models in this context are used for embedding tasks, converting data into a lower-dimensional form for visualization.

The deep learning models mentioned in the tensorflow.keras.applications modules, such as VGG16 and ResNet152V2, are pre-trained models for image classification tasks.

In summary, the deep learning models mentioned in the provided context serve various purposes, including classification, segmentation, embedding, and image classification.
