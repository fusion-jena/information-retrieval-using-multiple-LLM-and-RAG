I don't have the specific information about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline as it is not mentioned in the provided context. However, I can tell you that the context is about a study in ecological informatics, where the researchers are working with geospatial data of different types of ecosystems, climate, and dental traits.

The data they are working with is likely in the form of structured tables or databases, containing information about the location, climate variables, and dental traits for each locality. The format of this data could be CSV, Excel, or any other tabular format that can be used to store and manipulate structured data.

The study involves generating redescriptions, which are queries over dental traits and climate variables, to identify and describe the ecological niches of different species. The queries are generated using a deep learning pipeline, which involves training a neural network to learn the relationships between the dental traits and climate variables and the ecological niches of the species.

Therefore, while the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are not mentioned, it is likely that the data is in a structured tabular format, such as CSV, that can be used for training machine learning models.
