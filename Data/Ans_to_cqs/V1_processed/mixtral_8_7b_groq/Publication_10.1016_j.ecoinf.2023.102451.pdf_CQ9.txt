The context provided does not give information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It mentions the use of a publicly available dataset called EMDS-6 for testing the proposed EMViT-Net framework, but it does not specify where the dataset or the code for the pipeline can be found. For complete transparency and reproducibility of research, it is important to make both the dataset and the code accessible to other researchers. Therefore, I would recommend the authors to consider depositing their code and dataset in a public repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
