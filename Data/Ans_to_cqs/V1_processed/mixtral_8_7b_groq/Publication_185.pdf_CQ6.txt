Based on the provided context, there are no specific preprocessing steps mentioned for the image classification task using the AlexNet architecture. However, it is generally common practice to perform certain preprocessing steps before training a deep learning model. These steps may include:

1. Normalization: This involves scaling the input data to a range of values, typically between 0 and 1. This is often done by dividing each pixel value by 255, which is the maximum pixel value for an 8-bit image. Normalization can help improve the training process by reducing the effect of the scale of the input data.
2. Scaling: Similar to normalization, scaling involves transforming the input data to a different range of values. This can be useful when the input data has a wide range of values, which can cause problems during training.
3. Cleaning: This involves removing any noise or artifacts from the input data that may negatively impact the training process. This can include removing irrelevant features, imputing missing values, or correcting any errors in the data.

In the context provided, it is mentioned that the feature extractors were initialized with white Gaussian noise and learned from the data. This suggests that some form of preprocessing was performed on the input data before it was fed into the model. However, the specific preprocessing steps are not mentioned.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions that the learning rate was set to 10-2 for all layers initially, and was decreased using a "step" learning rate policy. This is a form of learning rate scheduling, which can be considered a type of preprocessing step as it involves modifying the training process to improve convergence and avoid issues such as overfitting.

In summary, while the specific preprocessing steps are not mentioned in the provided context, it is common practice to perform normalization, scaling, and cleaning on input data before training a deep learning model. Additionally, learning rate scheduling can be considered a type of preprocessing step that can improve the training process.
