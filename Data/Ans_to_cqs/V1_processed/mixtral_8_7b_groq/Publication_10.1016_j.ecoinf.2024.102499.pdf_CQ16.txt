Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it can be inferred that the training process involves the use of ecological data, possibly including features like the numbers provided (85, 80, 10474, etc.) and the application of machine learning models such as Transformer mechanisms and semi-automated methods.

In general, training of machine learning models is often considered complete when the validation loss plateaus or stops decreasing significantly. This is because the goal of training is to minimize the difference between the model's predictions and the actual values (i.e., the loss). Once the validation loss has stabilized, it suggests that the model has learned the underlying patterns in the data and further training is unlikely to improve performance.

Moreover, the context mentions the use of F-measure, precision, and recall as evaluation metrics. These metrics are commonly used in machine learning to assess the performance of a model. It is possible that these metrics were also used to monitor the training progress and determine when to stop training. For instance, if the F-measure, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, reaches a satisfactory level and stops improving, this could be an indicator of complete training.

However, it is important to note that this is an inferred answer based on general practices in machine learning training and the limited context provided. The specific criteria used to determine training completion in this particular study are not explicitly stated in the text.
