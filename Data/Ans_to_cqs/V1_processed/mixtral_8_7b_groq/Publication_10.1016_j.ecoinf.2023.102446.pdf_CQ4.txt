The provided context does not include information about any deep learning pipeline or data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The text focuses on the use of the Temporal Information Partitioning Network (TIPNet) for analyzing environmental data collected from a flux tower. The data used in this study includes respiration (RE), net solar radiation (NSR), air temperature (TA), wind speed (WS), relative humidity (RH), and precipitation (P) measured at half-hour intervals from December 2014 to November 2016. The data was collected by Dr. Sandipan Mukherjee and the competent authorities of G.B. Pant National Institute of Himalayan Environment, Almora, Uttarakhand, India.

The study used 100 surrogates and a significance level of 1% to compute the network, considering lagged information from 1 to 12 hours. The authors highlighted a limitation of the study due to the unavailability of post-2016 flux tower data.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot provide information on the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
