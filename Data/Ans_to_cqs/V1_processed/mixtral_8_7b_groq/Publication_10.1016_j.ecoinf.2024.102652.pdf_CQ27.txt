The provided context discusses the training process for a deep learning model used in soil salinity detection, but it does not explicitly mention the steps taken to deploy the trained model. However, based on common practices in deep learning model deployment, we can make some educated guesses.



After training the model, the next step would typically be to serialize the model, which involves saving the model's architecture, weights, and other relevant information to a file. This allows the model to be easily loaded and used for making predictions on new data. The context does not mention which specific format was used for model serialization, but popular options include HDF5, JSON, and YAML.

Once the model is serialized, the next step would be to select a platform for deploying the model. The context does not provide information on the intended deployment platform, but common options include local machines, cloud servers, and edge devices. The choice of platform would depend on factors such as the expected volume of predictions, the need for real-time predictions, and the available resources.

Assuming that the model was deployed on a local machine or server, the final step would be to integrate the serialized model with an application or service that provides the necessary input data and handles the model's output. This could involve writing custom code to load the model and make predictions, or using a framework or library that simplifies the process.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the steps taken to deploy the trained deep learning model, it is likely that the model was serialized, a platform was selected for deployment, and the model was integrated with an application or service for making predictions. However, the specific details of these steps are not provided in the context.
