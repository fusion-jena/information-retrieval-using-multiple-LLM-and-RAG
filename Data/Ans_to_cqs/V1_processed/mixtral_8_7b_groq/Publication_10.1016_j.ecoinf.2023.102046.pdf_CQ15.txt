In the deep learning pipeline, different optimization techniques are used for the training of the models. The specific optimization techniques used in the pipeline described in the context are Adam and AdamW.

The Adam optimizer is used for the Inception-V3 model. Adam is a popular optimization algorithm for training deep learning models, which is an extension of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method. It combines the advantages of two other optimization methods: AdaGrad, which adjusts the learning rate based on the historical gradient, and RMSProp, which scales the learning rate by the moving average of the squared gradient.

On the other hand, the AdamW optimizer is used for the Hugging Face models, which include ViT and ResNet-50. AdamW is a variant of the Adam optimizer that includes weight decay, which is also known as L2 regularization. This helps in preventing overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which is proportional to the square of the model's weights.

The learning rate is another important hyperparameter in the optimization process. The learning rate determines the size of the steps that the optimizer takes while moving toward a minimum of the loss function. In the described pipeline, the learning rate is set to 1e-5 for the Vanilla Inception-V3 and ViT models, while for the Deep Otolith ResNet model, a learning rate of 4e-4 is used.

Furthermore, the batch size is another hyperparameter that affects the optimization process. The batch size determines the number of training examples used in each update of the model's weights. In the described pipeline, a batch size of 16 is used for all models.

In summary, the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline described in the context are the Adam and AdamW optimizers, with different learning rates and batch sizes for each model. These optimization techniques help in training accurate and efficient deep learning models by minimizing the loss function and preventing overfitting.
