Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the deep learning frameworks used in the studies. The focus of the texts is more on the methodologies, techniques, and applications of deep learning in remote sensing rather than the specific software or frameworks utilized for implementation.

However, it is important to note that TensorFlow and PyTorch are two of the most popular deep learning frameworks currently in use. Considering the studies are related to remote sensing and machine learning, it is highly likely that one of these two frameworks (or potentially another popular framework like Keras or MXNet) was employed. But without explicit information, it is not possible to give a definitive answer.


The specific deep learning frameworks used in the studies mentioned are not explicitly stated in the provided context. Popular frameworks include TensorFlow and PyTorch, but without further information, we cannot confirm which was used.
