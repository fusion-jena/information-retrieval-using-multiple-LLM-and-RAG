In the provided text, the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are not explicitly mentioned. However, it is mentioned that a deep convolutional neural network VGG-19 is used in [9] for corresponding coral classification. VGG-19 is a pre-trained model that has been trained on a large-scale dataset, ImageNet. The model has 19 layers, and it uses small filters of size 3 x 3 throughout the network.

When it comes to training a deep learning model, there are several hyperparameters that can be tuned to achieve better performance. Some of the common hyperparameters used in deep learning models include:

1. Learning rate: It determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function. A learning rate that is too small may result in slow convergence, while a learning rate that is too large may result in overshooting the minimum.
2. Optimizer: It is used to update the weights of the model based on the gradient of the loss function. Some of the commonly used optimizers include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop.
3. Batch size: It is the number of samples that are processed before the model is updated. A larger batch size may result in more stable gradients, while a smaller batch size may result in noisier gradients.
4. Number of epochs: It is the number of times the entire training dataset is passed through the model.
5. Regularization techniques: They are used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. Some of the commonly used regularization techniques include L1 and L2 regularization.

In the table provided, it can be observed that different techniques have been used for coral classification, including hand-crafted descriptors and deep convolutional neural network (D-CNN) models. The performance of these techniques has been evaluated based on sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F1-score, and Cohen's Kappa (Îº). However, the specific hyperparameters used for training these models are not provided in the table.

Therefore, while the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, it is essential to tune these hyperparameters to achieve better performance.
