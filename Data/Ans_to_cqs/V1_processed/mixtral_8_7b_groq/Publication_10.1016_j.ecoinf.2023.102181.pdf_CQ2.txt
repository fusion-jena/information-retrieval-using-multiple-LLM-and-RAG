Based on the provided context, the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are not mentioned. However, the context discusses a study related to predicting soil classes in three semi-arid landscapes using machine learning techniques. It is likely that the data used in this study is in a format that can represent spatial data, such as raster or vector formats.

Raster data is a grid of cells where each cell holds a value representing a specific attribute, such as soil class or elevation. Vector data, on the other hand, represents geographic features as points, lines, and polygons. These data formats are commonly used in geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing applications.

The context also mentions the use of validation techniques such as out-of-bag, spatial leave-one-out cross-validation, and KDE weighting. These techniques suggest that the data used in the study is likely to be spatially distributed and may have some autocorrelation. Therefore, it is important to use appropriate validation techniques that consider the spatial structure of the data.

In summary, while the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are not mentioned in the provided context, it is likely that the data is in a format that can represent spatial data, such as raster or vector formats. Additionally, the use of spatial validation techniques suggests that the data has a spatial structure that needs to be considered in the analysis.
