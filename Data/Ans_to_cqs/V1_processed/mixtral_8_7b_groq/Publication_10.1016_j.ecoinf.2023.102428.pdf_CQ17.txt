The provided context does not include specific information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline for the MLPnn-MC model. However, it is mentioned that the model uses a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) algorithm, which is a type of artificial neural network (ANN). In ANNs, including MLPs, overfitting can be prevented using various regularization techniques such as L1 and L2 regularization, dropout, early stopping, and data augmentation. L1 and L2 regularization methods add a penalty term to the loss function to reduce the complexity of the model, while dropout randomly sets a fraction of input units to zero during training, preventing over-dependence on individual neurons. Early stopping is another regularization technique that stops training when the performance on a validation set stops improving, and data augmentation increases the amount of training data through various transformations. Although not explicitly mentioned, it is plausible that the MLPnn-MC model employs one or more of these regularization techniques to prevent overfitting.
