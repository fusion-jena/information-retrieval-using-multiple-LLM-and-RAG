The provided context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It only states that machine-learning models were used to predict the potential effects of climate change on animal spatial distribution in the Massaciuccoli Lake basin. Therefore, based on the given information, it is not possible to determine whether a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Transformer, or any other specific deep learning model was utilized.
