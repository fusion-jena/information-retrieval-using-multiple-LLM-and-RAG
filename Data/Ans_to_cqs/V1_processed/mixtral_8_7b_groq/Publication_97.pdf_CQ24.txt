The provided context discusses the use of deep learning in remote sensing for vegetation science, specifically for recognizing forest disturbances. While it does not explicitly mention a random seed value, it does describe several strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

One such strategy is the use of data augmentation through random cropping. Training data was generated as batches of sub-images of size 256 × 256, which were randomly cropped out from the original satellite images. These sub-images were almost never repeated, creating a stream of varied data for the neural network training (Remote Sens. 2020, 12, 1145).

Another strategy to handle randomness is the use of batch normalization. Batch normalization is a technique that normalizes the activations of the neurons in a layer for each mini-batch. This method reduces internal covariate shift, which makes the network more stable during training and helps in achieving better performance (Ioﬀe & Szegedy, 2015).

Additionally, the context mentions the use of dropout as a regularization technique. Dropout is a method that prevents overfitting by randomly dropping out a proportion of the neurons during training. This introduces randomness into the network and helps the model generalize better (Srivastava et al., 2014).

Lastly, the context refers to an evaluation of CNN design choices performance on ImageNet-2012, which includes the use of different initialization methods. Initialization methods can affect the randomness of the weights and biases in the network, which in turn can impact the training process (Evaluation of the CNN Design Choices Performance on ImageNet-2012).

In summary, the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, as described in the provided context, include random cropping for data augmentation, batch normalization, dropout for regularization, and initialization methods for the network's weights and biases.
