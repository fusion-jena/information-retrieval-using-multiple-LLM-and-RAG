I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The text mentions the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) as a cloud-based platform for processing big geospatial data and developing algorithms, but it does not specify where the pipeline or the data related to it can be found or accessed. Therefore, I am unable to provide the requested link. I hope this information is helpful.
