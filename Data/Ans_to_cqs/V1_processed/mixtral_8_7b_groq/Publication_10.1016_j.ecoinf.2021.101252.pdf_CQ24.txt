The provided context discusses the use of AutoML in the mcfly system for ecological time series classification, including strategies for handling class imbalance. However, it does not directly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value.

In general, deep learning models contain various sources of randomness, including the initialization of model weights, the order of training samples, and dropout regularization. These sources of randomness can impact model training and performance. To handle randomness, deep learning practitioners may employ strategies such as setting a fixed random seed value, using multiple random seeds to train and evaluate models, and using techniques like batch normalization to reduce the impact of weight initialization.

In the context of AutoML, the mcfly system generates a set of candidate models with architectures and hyperparameters selected at random from a prespecified range of values. While the text does not explicitly mention the use of a fixed random seed value for this process, it is a common practice in machine learning and deep learning to set a fixed seed value to ensure reproducibility and manage randomness.

Moreover, the mcfly system uses a balanced data set for training and internal validation, achieved by randomly duplicating presence records and deleting absence records until a balance of ~50:50 is obtained. This strategy helps mitigate the impact of class imbalance, which can be considered another source of randomness affecting model performance.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, general practices for managing randomness in deep learning include setting a fixed random seed value, using multiple random seeds, and employing techniques like batch normalization. In the context of the mcfly system, the use of a fixed random seed value and data balancing strategies may help manage randomness and ensure reproducibility in the AutoML process.
