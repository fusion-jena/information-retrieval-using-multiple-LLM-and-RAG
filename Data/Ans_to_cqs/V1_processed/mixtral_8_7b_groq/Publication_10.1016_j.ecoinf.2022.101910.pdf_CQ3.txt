The provided context does not give specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the BirdNET deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that BirdNET is a project between The Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the Chemnitz University of Technology, which facilitates the automated detection and classification of bird vocalizations from sound recordings using a developed deep neural network.

In general, data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines for computer vision tasks include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing a box around the object of interest in an image. It provides the coordinates of the bounding box, which can be used to train object detection models.
2. Instance segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image to indicate the object it belongs to. It provides a more precise localization of the object compared to bounding box annotation.
3. Semantic segmentation: This technique involves labeling pixels in an image according to the category of the object they belong to, without distinguishing between instances of the same category.

For audio data annotation, techniques such as time-stamp annotation and spectrogram annotation are commonly used. Time-stamp annotation involves labeling the start and end times of the sound event in an audio recording. Spectrogram annotation involves labeling regions of interest in a spectrogram image, which is a visualization of the frequency content of a sound over time.

In the context of BirdNET, the annotation process likely involves labeling audio recordings with the time-stamps and species of bird vocalizations. However, the specific annotation technique used in the BirdNET deep learning pipeline is not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, the answer to the query is:
