Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete for the SCAM-Herb models. However, it can be inferred that the training process involves monitoring the performance of the models at different epochs and with varying amounts of the training dataset.

In Figure 8, the accuracy of the training sets at different epochs is reported for each of the four SCAM-Herb models based on the Tree-CA, Gated-CA, Mixed-CA, and GAP-CA modules. It can be observed that the performance of the models generally increases with the number of epochs, indicating that the training process is ongoing. However, it is not specified at which point the training is considered complete.

Additionally, Table 2 compares the classification performance of the proposed SCAM-Herb models using evaluation criteria such as accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1-score. While these criteria are commonly used to assess the performance of machine learning models, they do not provide information on when training should be stopped.

Therefore, it can be concluded that the provided context does not contain specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the SCAM-Herb models.
