The provided context does not include specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for the studies mentioned. However, I can provide a brief overview of some common data annotation techniques in deep learning, which might be used in similar research.

Data annotation is an essential step in deep learning projects, particularly in computer vision tasks, where images or videos need to be labeled for training models. Some common data annotation techniques include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest in an image. It helps the model to learn the location and size of objects within the image.

2. Image segmentation: This method involves dividing an image into multiple regions or segments, where each segment corresponds to a specific object or class. There are two main types of image segmentation: semantic segmentation and instance segmentation.

   a. Semantic segmentation: In this approach, each pixel in an image is assigned to a specific class. However, it does not differentiate between individual instances of the same class.

   b. Instance segmentation: This technique extends semantic segmentation by differentiating individual instances of the same class. Each object is assigned a unique identifier, allowing the model to understand the number and location of individual objects.

3. Pixel-level annotation: This method involves labeling each pixel in an image with a specific class. It is commonly used in image segmentation tasks and can provide high-level detail for model training.

4. Scene annotation: In this technique, an entire scene or image is annotated with a single class label. It is useful for tasks where the focus is on the overall scene or image context rather than individual objects.

5. Keypoint annotation: This method involves annotating specific points or landmarks on objects within an image. It is often used in human pose estimation or facial keypoint detection tasks.

While the provided context does not mention any specific data annotation techniques, researchers may use one or more of these methods depending on the deep learning task and the desired model outcomes.
