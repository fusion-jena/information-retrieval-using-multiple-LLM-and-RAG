The deep learning model in question, Inception-ResNet-v2, is used for the purpose of classification. This model is trained to identify and classify endemic bird species by learning and extracting relevant features from a given dataset of bird images. The model is designed to generate discriminatory features using inception modules, which consist of Inception-ResNet-A, Inception-ResNet-B, and Inception-ResNet-C blocks. These blocks utilize 35 × 35, 17 × 7, and 8 × 8 grid modules, respectively, to extract local and generic features from the input bird images. The model processes images of size 299 × 299 pixels with three different color channels (red, green, and blue) at the stem layer. By computing three different sizes of filters (1 × 1, 3 × 3, and 5 × 5) and a max pooling layer within the same module, the model obtains various feature extraction patterns of the bird images. The learned features are then transferred to a second target network to train the newly added dataset on endemic bird species, enabling the utilization of knowledge from previously learned tasks and improving the learning of the target predictive function for identifying endemic bird species.
