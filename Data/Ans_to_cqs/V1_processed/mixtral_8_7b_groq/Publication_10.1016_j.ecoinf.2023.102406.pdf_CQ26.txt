The provided context discusses various techniques used in the preprocessing of data for modeling, although it does not explicitly mention the term "deep learning." However, some of the techniques mentioned can be applied to deep learning pipelines to address data bias.

Sample thinning, as discussed in section 4.5, involves reducing the number of samples taken from one study site. While this technique is not directly related to addressing data bias, it can help in maintaining the same species pool when minimum sample size thresholds are lowered.

Section 2.1 discusses the use of accuracy metrics on separate testing data or withheld known classes to determine how well the classifier assigns classes using predictor variables. The testing data were 25% of the samples, randomly sampled, which is a standard modeling practice. This technique is known as stratified splitting, where the data is divided into subgroups according to the distribution of labels. Stratified sampling helps ensure that each subset has a similar distribution of labels, reducing bias.

Section 2.4 discusses variable reduction for correlation. While this technique is not directly related to addressing data bias, it can help in reducing the dimensionality of the data, which can improve the performance of the model.

The context does not mention oversampling or undersampling techniques explicitly. Oversampling involves increasing the number of instances of the minority class, while undersampling involves decreasing the number of instances of the majority class. These techniques can help in addressing data bias by balancing the class distribution.

The context also does not mention diverse data collection explicitly. Diverse data collection involves collecting data from various sources, which can help in reducing bias by ensuring that the data is representative of the population.

In conclusion, the provided context discusses various techniques used in the preprocessing of data for modeling, including stratified splitting, variable reduction for correlation, and sample thinning. While these techniques are not explicitly related to addressing data bias in deep learning pipelines, they can help in improving the performance of the model. Techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection can help in addressing data bias explicitly.
