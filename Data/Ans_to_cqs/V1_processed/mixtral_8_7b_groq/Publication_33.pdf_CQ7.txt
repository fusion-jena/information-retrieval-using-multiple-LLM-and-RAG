The provided context discusses the use of two datasets, T0 and T1, in the training and threshold tuning phases of a classification model built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for species identification. However, it does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for train, test, and validation in the context of deep learning model training.

In general, when training deep learning models, it is common to split the data into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and select the best model, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final model's performance.

The specific criteria used to split the data can vary depending on the problem and the size of the dataset. A common approach is to use a random split, where a certain percentage of the data is randomly assigned to each subset. For example, one might use an 80/10/10 split, where 80% of the data is used for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing.

In some cases, it may be more appropriate to use a stratified split, where the subsets are created such that each subset has the same proportion of samples from each class. This can be useful when the classes are imbalanced, as it helps ensure that the model is trained and evaluated on a representative sample of each class.

In the context of the provided text, it is possible that the T0 dataset was used for training, and the T1 dataset was used for threshold tuning. However, without additional information, it is not possible to determine whether these datasets were further split into training, validation, and testing subsets.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it is common practice to use a training, validation, and testing split. The specific criteria used can vary depending on the problem and the size of the dataset, with random and stratified splits being common approaches.
