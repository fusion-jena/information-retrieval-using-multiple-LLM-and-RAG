The text does not provide information about the specific platform that was used to deploy the deep learning model. It only mentions that the models were trained on a cloud service provided by Sigma2 - the National Infrastructure for High Performance Computing and Data Storage in Norway. Therefore, I cannot give a specific answer to this question.
