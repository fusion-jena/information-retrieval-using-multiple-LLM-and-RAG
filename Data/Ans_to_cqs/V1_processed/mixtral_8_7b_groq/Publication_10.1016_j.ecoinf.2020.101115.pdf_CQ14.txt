Based on the provided context, there is no information about how the hyperparameters of a specific model are optimized. The text focuses on data models and vocabularies used in ecological informatics, particularly in the context of fish scale and otolith samples. It mentions various parameters and external vocabulary servers used for those parameters, but it does not provide information on model training or hyperparameter optimization.

It is important to note that the process of hyperparameter optimization, such as through grid search or random search, typically applies to machine learning models. The context provided here focuses on data modeling and vocabularies in the field of ecological informatics, and it does not mention any machine learning models or their training.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query using the given context.
