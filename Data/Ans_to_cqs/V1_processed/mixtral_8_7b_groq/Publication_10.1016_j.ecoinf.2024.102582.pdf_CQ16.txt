Based on the provided context, there is no information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The text focuses on the classification of land use types, particularly mangroves, along the southeastern coast of China using Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-8 OLI sensors.

The methodology includes generating training samples using Google Earth Pro, dividing them into training and validation datasets, and applying the random forest algorithm for classification. Post-classification processing is then used to correct misclassifications within a 10-km buffer zone.

However, the context does not mention any details about the training process convergence or validation metrics, such as loss functions or accuracy metrics, that might indicate when training is complete. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
