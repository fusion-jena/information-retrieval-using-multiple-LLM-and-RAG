The provided context does not include specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model for modeling animal biodiversity using acoustic monitoring. The paper by Chalmers et al., 2021, mentions using a deep learning model for this purpose but does not provide details about the hyperparameters.

Hyperparameters are important configuration variables that are set before training a machine learning model. They include learning rate, optimizer, number of layers, number of neurons, batch size, and more. The choice of hyperparameters can significantly impact the performance of the model.

In the context provided, the paper by Chalmers et al., 2021, mentions using a deep learning model for modeling animal biodiversity using acoustic monitoring. However, the specific hyperparameters used in the model are not provided. The paper mentions using a deep neural network (DNN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN) for bird species identification. However, the hyperparameters for these models are not specified.

Therefore, it is not possible to provide an answer to the query without additional information. Hyperparameters are crucial for the performance of a deep learning model, and it is essential to report them for reproducibility and comparison purposes. It is recommended that future research on this topic includes a detailed description of the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
