I don't know.

The provided context discusses the use of a random forest machine learning approach for remote sensing and the detection of invasive species, specifically Brazilian peppertree in the Everglades National Park and Big Cypress National Preserve. The process involves using training data from the Vegetation Mapping Project and applying the algorithm to multispectral airborne and satellite imagery. However, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or any code repository hosting services such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
