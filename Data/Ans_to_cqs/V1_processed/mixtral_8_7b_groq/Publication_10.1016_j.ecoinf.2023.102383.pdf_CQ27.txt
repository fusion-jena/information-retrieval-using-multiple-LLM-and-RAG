The text provided does not give specific details about the process of deploying the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that a feature extractor based on Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and ResNet152 was used to extract five feature maps from the original UAV thermal image. These feature maps have different resolutions and are used by the region proposal network to generate RoIs (Regions of Interest) of varying sizes. The model then selects a feature map for each RoI based on its size, with larger RoIs assigned higher resolution feature maps. This suggests that the model serialization process likely involved saving the trained model along with the architecture and weights, so that it can be used for inference on new data.

As for platform selection, the text does not provide any information about where the model was deployed or how it was integrated into a larger system. However, it is mentioned that the model was customized for detecting small objects such as deer from UAV thermal images, indicating that the deployment platform was likely chosen with this specific use case in mind.

In summary, while the text does not provide specific details about the process of deploying the trained deep learning model, it can be inferred that the model was serialized and deployed on a platform suitable for UAV thermal image analysis, with a feature extractor based on FPN and ResNet152.
