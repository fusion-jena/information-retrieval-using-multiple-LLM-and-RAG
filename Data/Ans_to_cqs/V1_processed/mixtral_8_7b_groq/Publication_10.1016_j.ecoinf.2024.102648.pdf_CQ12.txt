The provided context discusses the use of machine learning and deep learning models for predicting the percent disease incidence of Cotton Leaf Curl Disease (CLCuD). However, it does not specify the exact type of deep learning model used in the pipeline, other than mentioning the use of an artificial neural network (ANN).

Among the different types of deep learning models, ANN is a basic type that is inspired by the structure and function of biological neural networks. However, there are more advanced deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Transformers that have shown superior performance in various applications.

Based on the provided context, it is unclear whether the authors have used a basic ANN or one of the advanced deep learning models such as CNN, RNN, or Transformers. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.

 An artificial neural network (ANN) is mentioned as a deep learning model used in the pipeline, but the exact type of deep learning model, such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer, is not specified in the provided context.
