Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, the context does mention some data selection and preprocessing methods used in classical neural network models and other related research. These methods could potentially be used or adapted to address data bias in deep learning.

One such method is stratified splitting, which is a technique used to ensure that each subset (e.g., training, validation, testing) of the data is representative of the original dataset's distribution. This can help prevent data bias by ensuring that each subset has a similar distribution of classes, features, or other relevant factors.

Another method mentioned in the context is the use of large-scale data for training deep learning models. By using a diverse and large dataset, the model can learn a wider range of features and patterns, which can help reduce data bias and improve model performance.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of radial basis function neural networks for ecological footprint forecasting. This type of neural network uses a different activation function than traditional deep learning models, which could potentially help address data bias by allowing the model to learn different patterns or features in the data.

Finally, the context also mentions the use of hybrid models, such as a combination of ARIMA and neural network models for time series forecasting. These hybrid models could potentially be used to address data bias by combining the strengths of multiple models or techniques.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, it does mention several data selection and preprocessing methods that could potentially be used or adapted to address data bias in deep learning, such as stratified splitting, large-scale data training, radial basis function neural networks, and hybrid models.
