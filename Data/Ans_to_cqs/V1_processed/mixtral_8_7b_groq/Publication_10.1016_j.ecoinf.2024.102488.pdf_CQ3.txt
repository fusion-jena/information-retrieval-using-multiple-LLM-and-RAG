The provided context does not include specific information about data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of remote sensing data from various sources such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) for land cover classification and mapping.

In the context of remote sensing and geospatial analysis, data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines typically include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest in an image. It is commonly used for object detection tasks, where the goal is to identify the location and extent of objects such as buildings, cars, or trees.
2. Semantic segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image with a class label, such as water, vegetation, or urban. It is used for image segmentation tasks, where the goal is to partition an image into meaningful regions or objects.
3. Instance segmentation: This technique combines object detection and semantic segmentation, where each instance of an object is labeled with a unique identifier. It is used for tasks such as counting objects or tracking their movement over time.

For example, in the study by Li et al. (2021), multispectral, hyperspectral, and LiDAR data were used to map multi-layered mangroves. While the study does not explicitly mention data annotation techniques, it is likely that some form of pixel-level labeling or segmentation was used to distinguish mangrove layers and other land cover types. Similarly, in the study by Liu et al. (2019), an ensemble learning model was used to classify coastal wetland vegetation using Chinese GF satellite data. The study likely involved some form of data annotation or labeling to distinguish between different vegetation communities.

In summary, while the provided context does not include specific information about data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines, it is common practice in remote sensing and geospatial analysis to use techniques such as bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation for object detection, image segmentation, and other tasks.
