The provided context does not directly discuss data bias techniques in the context of deep learning. However, it does mention some preprocessing techniques used in a machine learning pipeline that can indirectly help address data bias.

The paper "LightGBM: A Highly Efficient Gradient Boosting Decision Tree" (Ke et al., 2017) discusses the use of a machine learning algorithm called LightGBM, which is a gradient boosting decision tree algorithm. While the paper does not explicitly mention data bias techniques, it does discuss the use of feature selection methods such as Recursive Feature Elimination and Cross-Validation (RFECV) to improve model performance by reducing redundancy caused by multi-source feature datasets.

The paper "Responses of net primary productivity to phenological dynamics based on a data fusion algorithm in the northern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau" (Li et al., 2022) discusses the use of a data fusion algorithm to integrate remote sensing data from multiple sources. While the paper does not explicitly mention data bias techniques, it does discuss the importance of diverse data collection to improve the accuracy of the model.

The paper "Using C-band synthetic aperture radar data to monitor forested wetland hydrology in Marylandâ€™s coastal plain, USA" (Lang and Kasischke, 2008) discusses the use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data to monitor forested wetland hydrology. While the paper does not explicitly mention data bias techniques, it does discuss the importance of collecting data from multiple sources and at different times to improve the accuracy of the model.

The paper " Mapping multi-layered mangroves from multispectral, hyperspectral, and LiDAR data" (Li et al., 2021) discusses the use of multispectral, hyperspectral, and LiDAR data to map multi-layered mangroves. While the paper does not explicitly mention data bias techniques, it does discuss the importance of collecting diverse data from multiple sources to improve the accuracy of the model.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention data bias techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, it does discuss the importance of collecting diverse data from multiple sources and using feature selection methods to improve model performance. These techniques can indirectly help address data bias by ensuring that the training data is representative of the overall population and reducing the impact of redundant or irrelevant features.
