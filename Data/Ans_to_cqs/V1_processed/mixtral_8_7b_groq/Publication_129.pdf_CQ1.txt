The papers provided as context do not give explicit information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipelines they describe. However, we can infer that multiple sources are used, such as sensors, public datasets, and possibly surveys.

In paper [18], the authors use a smart near-infrared (NIR) analysis system for water pollution detection in agricultural irrigation resources. It is likely that the NIR sensors are used to collect raw data for the deep learning model.

Paper [19] introduces IP102, a large-scale benchmark dataset for insect pest recognition. The dataset is created using a public dataset, and it is possible that other public datasets were used for pre-training or augmentation.

In paper [20], the authors describe an automatic localization and counting system for agricultural crop pests based on an improved deep learning pipeline. The raw data collection method is not explicitly mentioned, but it can be inferred that images or videos of crop pests are used as input.

Paper [21] presents a benchmarking of learning strategies for pest detection and identification on tomato plants for autonomous scouting robots using internal databases. This suggests that the raw data is collected using a system of sensors or cameras mounted on robots.

The mobile application for agricultural pests recognition described in the paper "A new mobile application of agricultural pests recognition using deep learning in cloud computing system" (M.E. Karar et al.) uses deep learning techniques, specifically Faster R-CNN, for pest detection. The raw data collection method is not specified in the paper, but it can be assumed that images or videos of pests are used as input.

In summary, while the papers do not provide explicit information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipelines, it can be inferred that multiple sources are used, such as sensors, public datasets, and possibly surveys.
