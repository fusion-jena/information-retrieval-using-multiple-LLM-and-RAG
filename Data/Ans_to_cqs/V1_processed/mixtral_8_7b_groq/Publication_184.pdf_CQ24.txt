The provided context does not directly mention any strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does discuss some aspects of the training process for a Yolo model used for fish detection in images.

One way to handle randomness in deep learning is by setting a fixed seed value for the random number generator. This ensures that the same sequence of random numbers is generated every time the model is trained, making the training process reproducible. However, the provided context does not mention whether such a seed value was used in the training process.

The context does mention that data augmentation was used to extend the amount of training data. Data augmentation involves applying random transformations to the training data, such as rotation, scaling, and flipping. While the randomness in these transformations is not the same as the randomness in the training process, it is still a source of variability that can affect the model's performance. Therefore, it is important to apply these transformations in a controlled and reproducible manner.

The context also mentions that the number of epochs was set to 200 to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model learns the training data too well and performs poorly on new, unseen data. By limiting the number of epochs, the model is prevented from learning the training data too closely, reducing the risk of overfitting. While this is not a direct strategy for handling randomness, it does help to ensure that the model's performance is not overly dependent on the randomness of the training data.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly mention any strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does discuss some aspects of the training process that can affect the model's performance. These include the use of data augmentation and the setting of the number of epochs to prevent overfitting. However, the context does not mention whether a fixed seed value was used to ensure reproducibility.
