Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the studies. The context mainly discusses the research findings related to the detection of North Atlantic right whale up-calls using WT-HMM (Wavelet Transform-Hidden Markov Model) and a deep learning solution for avian diversity monitoring called Birdnet.

The first study by Ibrahim et al., 2018, focuses on feature extraction methods for detecting whale up-calls, but it does not mention any code repository. Similarly, the second study by Kahl et al., 2021, introduces Birdnet, a deep learning model for avian diversity monitoring, but it does not provide information about the code repository either.

Therefore, I cannot provide the code repository location based on the given context. If you are interested in the Birdnet project, I would recommend contacting the authors directly or looking for more information on their official website or other publications related to the project.
