The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model include precision-recall performance curves, average precision (AP), and fixed recall. Precision-recall performance curves are calculated to assess the model's accuracy and detection success. The AP, as measured by the area under the curve, is a standard approach for summarizing accuracy. For example, the best-performing configuration with a non-maximum suppression (NMS) of 30% achieves an AP of 94.45%. If a detector is perfect, it will be represented by the colored dot at the place on the line that is closest to the upper right corner of the precision-recall coordinate system. Moreover, if a fixed recall of 80% is required, the yellow diamond specifies the best possible accuracy across all possible configurations. However, the text does not explicitly mention the use of accuracy or recall metrics individually.
