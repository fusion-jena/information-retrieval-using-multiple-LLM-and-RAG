The deep learning model in question is used for image classification. This is evident in the context provided, where the model is used to classify digital images of vegetation. More specifically, the model is trained to distinguish between two classes of images: those containing woody vegetation, and those containing everything else (grass, open soil, buildings, etc.).

The authors decided to train the model from scratch using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, as they found their specific classification problem to be different from pre-trained networks. They used ReLU activation for the convolutional layers and an exponential linear unit (ELU) activation on the fully connected layer. The optimizer used was the adaptive ADAM with a learning rate of 0.0001.

The authors trained the CNN using a batch size of 256 over 16,290 iterations (equivalent to 90 epochs). After training, the model was applied to whole repeat photographs, which were split into 50 Ã— 50 pixel tiles to match the size of the training samples. The classifier predicted the output for each single tile and reassembled them to the original image size.

The purpose of this deep learning model is to classify images of vegetation into one of two categories: woody vegetation or non-woody vegetation. The model achieves this by learning and extracting relevant features from the training data during the training process, eliminating the need for complex feature extraction methods used in previous approaches.
