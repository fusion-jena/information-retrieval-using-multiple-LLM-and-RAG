The provided context does not include specific information about the hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. The text focuses on different types of models used in landslide susceptibility modeling (LSM), including machine learning models (MLMs) and deep learning models, and the advantages of using heterogeneous ensemble techniques to optimize model performance. However, it does not mention any details about the hardware used for training these models. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query based on the given context.
