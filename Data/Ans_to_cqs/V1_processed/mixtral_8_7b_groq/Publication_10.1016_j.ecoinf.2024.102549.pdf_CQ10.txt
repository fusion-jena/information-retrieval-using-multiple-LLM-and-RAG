I am unable to provide the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline as it is not mentioned in the given context. The texts mainly discuss the application and advantages of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in water quality classification and algal bloom prediction in different lakes. They also mention specific studies and the CNN architecture (AlexNet) used in one of the research on Lake Dianchi. However, there is no information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline.
