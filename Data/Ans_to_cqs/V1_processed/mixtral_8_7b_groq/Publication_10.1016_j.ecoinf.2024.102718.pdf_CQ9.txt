Based on the information provided, there is no explicit mention of where the data repository for the deep learning pipeline is available. The datasets used in the study are specifically named as Plant Village and Dhan-Shomadhan, but the location for accessing these datasets, such as through a data repository like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF, is not specified. It is possible that the datasets were obtained directly from the sources cited in the study or through other means. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
