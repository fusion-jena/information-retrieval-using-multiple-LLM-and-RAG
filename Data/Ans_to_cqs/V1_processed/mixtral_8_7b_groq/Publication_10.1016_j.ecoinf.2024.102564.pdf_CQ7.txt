The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as train, test, and validation sets, are not specified in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the Random Forest (RF) model was trained using a subset of the data, and the final prediction was determined by aggregating the predictions of all trees.

In general, for deep learning models, the data is typically split into three sets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune the model's hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

In the context of the Atlantic Forest fragments in Minas Gerais, Brazil, the data was split into train and test sets for the machine learning models, including ANN, SVM, and RF. However, the specific criteria used to split the data are not provided.

It is important to note that the choice of criteria for splitting the data can have a significant impact on the model's performance. Commonly used criteria include random sampling, stratified sampling, and k-fold cross-validation.

In summary, while the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not provided in the given context, it is important to consider the criteria carefully to ensure the model's performance is accurately evaluated.
