The provided context does not directly discuss the regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, it does mention the use of deep learning techniques for improving NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) reconstruction and regularizing dense-time-series data.

In the context of NDVI reconstruction, the focus is on filling gaps in the NDVI time series data caused by weather-related occlusions or missing periods. The methods mentioned include an adaptive spatial-temporal tensor completion method (ST Sensor) and a combination of gap-filling and a Savitzky-Golay (SG) filter. These methods aim to achieve high-quality NDVI dense-time-series reconstructions of MODIS and Landsat data at the spatial scale.

The article also introduces a new high-quality NDVI image product and a technology framework called SOWCEM (Spatial-Temporal Optimal Weighted Consensus Estimation Method) for regularizing dense-time-series data with high spatial resolution. The SOWCEM framework offers a feasible method for reconstructing cloud-free high-resolution NDVI datasets. It calculates and allocates optimal weights for the prediction simulation results based on spatial and temporal dimensions, minimizing the sum of squares of the combined prediction errors within a specific time period.

While these methods are related to deep learning and regularization, they do not specifically mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines such as dropout or L2 regularization.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot provide a specific answer to the query regarding the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines.
