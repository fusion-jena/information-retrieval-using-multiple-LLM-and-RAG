The provided context does not mention the use of any deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers in the pipeline. The models that are mentioned are related to machine learning, not deep learning. These models include artificial neural networks (Park and Chung, 2006), random forest (Lee et al., 2019; Park et al., 2013), maximum entropy modeling (Hirata et al., 2017; Ikegami and Jenkins, 2018), and an ensemble model that integrates the random forest and maximum entropy models.

An ensemble model is used in the study to predict the potential occurrence of pine wilt disease based on environmental factors in South Korea. Ensemble models are a common technique in machine learning to address problems such as confidence estimation and error correction (Polikar, 2012). By integrating the models, each model acts in a complementary manner and generates better results. The ensemble model in this study showed a highly improved power of prediction compared to the corresponding power of either the random forest or maximum entropy model.

Therefore, the study does not use any deep learning models, and the models used are machine learning models, specifically artificial neural networks, random forest, maximum entropy modeling, and an ensemble model.
