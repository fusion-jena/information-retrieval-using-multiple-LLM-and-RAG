The provided context discusses the use of preprocessing techniques and feature extraction methods in the Unified Optical Detection Network (UODN) for underwater image analysis. However, it does not directly mention any methods for addressing data bias during preprocessing in the deep learning pipeline.

In general, techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Stratified splitting: This method involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on specific criteria (e.g., class labels) and then ensuring that each subset is proportionally represented in both the training and testing sets. This helps maintain balance and avoid bias in the data distribution.

2. Oversampling: In cases where certain classes are underrepresented in the dataset, oversampling can be used to increase the number of instances from these classes. This can be done either by duplicating existing instances or by generating synthetic data using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).

3. Undersampling: Conversely, if some classes have an overabundance of instances, undersampling can be employed to reduce the number of instances from these classes. This can be done randomly or by using more sophisticated methods like Tomek links or Edited Nearest Neighbors.

4. Diverse data collection: Collecting a diverse dataset with balanced representation from various sources, scenarios, and conditions can help minimize data bias. This includes accounting for variations in lighting, angles, object sizes, and other factors that may affect the model's performance.

While the provided context does not explicitly discuss these techniques, it does mention the use of data augmentation methods like mosaic data augmentation in the input layer of UODN. Data augmentation can help increase the diversity of the training data and reduce overfitting, but it does not directly address data bias.


The provided context does not discuss techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, general methods for mitigating data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.
