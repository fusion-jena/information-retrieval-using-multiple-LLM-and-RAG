Based on the provided context, there is no information about which specific deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, were used to build the model. The context focuses on the methodology and data used in an ecological carbon sink risk zone stability study, which includes the use of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data, socio-economic factor data, and various data sources like the Resource Environment Science and Data Research Center and Openstreetmap. The study also describes the use of formulas and indices for data analysis, such as the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic for identifying spatial clusters and the Moran's I index for spatial autocorrelation. However, it does not mention any deep learning frameworks.
