The text provided does not give a detailed description of the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does provide some context regarding the training and validation of the model.

First, the dataset was divided into training sets, which comprise 80% of the data, and a test set representing the remaining 20%. This division was done by random sampling to ensure that both subsets were representative of the overall dataset and minimized the risk of bias. The scikit-learn function GridSearchCV was then used to fine-tune the hyperparameters of each model within the confines of the training set. A five-fold cross-validation was used, and the negative mean square error was set as the target measure. Following this hyperparameter optimization process, the performance metrics were evaluated using the designated test set.

Based on the performance metrics obtained, the most effective models for each target variable were selected. However, the text does not provide information on what happened next, such as model serialization, platform selection, or how the model was integrated into a larger system.

In general, model serialization is the process of saving the trained model to disk so that it can be loaded and used later. This can be useful for deploying the model to a production environment or for sharing the model with others. Platform selection refers to choosing the hardware and software environment where the model will be deployed. This can include cloud-based platforms, on-premises servers, or edge devices.

Therefore, while the text provides some information about the training and validation of the deep learning model, it does not provide a complete description of the process followed to deploy the model.
