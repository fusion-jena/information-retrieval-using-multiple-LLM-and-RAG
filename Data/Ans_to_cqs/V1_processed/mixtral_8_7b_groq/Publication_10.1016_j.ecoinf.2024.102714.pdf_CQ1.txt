The provided context discusses a framework for generating detailed habitat maps using Earth Observation (EO) data, knowledge-based rules, and contextual information, but it does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer that EO-data, likely from satellites or aerial imagery, is one of the primary sources of raw data.

In the context, the authors mention using EO-data in Wales to discriminate dominant Vegetation Types (VTs) within natural/semi-natural vegetated land covers. This suggests that they use remote sensing techniques to gather this EO-data. Remote sensing involves the acquisition of information about the Earth's surface using sensors that are not in direct contact with the target. These sensors can be mounted on satellites, aircraft, or drones.

Additionally, the context implies that other datasets, possibly from surveys or public repositories, are used to minimize inconsistencies in contextual datasets and taxonomical systems. These datasets might include ground truth data collected through field surveys, existing land cover or habitat maps, or other relevant geospatial data.

To summarize, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, as inferred from the provided context, include:

1. Remote sensing techniques for acquiring EO-data, primarily through satellite or aerial imagery.
2. Utilization of other datasets, potentially from surveys, public repositories, or existing maps, to minimize inconsistencies in contextual datasets and taxonomical systems.

It is important to note that the context does not explicitly state the use of deep learning techniques. Instead, it describes a framework that could be adapted to include deep learning methods for generating detailed habitat maps.
