The process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model involved several steps, including model serialization and platform selection. After training the model using a two-stage process and achieving optimal performance, the model was serialized, or saved, using the Python programming language and the Keras library. Model serialization is an essential step in the deployment process as it allows the model to be stored and loaded for later use. In this case, the trained model was saved in a format (.h5) that could be easily loaded into a variety of platforms for deployment.

Once the model was serialized, a platform was selected for deployment. The implementation of the CNN classifier was done using the Keras library, which is a high-level deep learning library written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. TensorFlow, an open-source platform for machine learning, was used as the back-end engine for this project, and it offers the advantage of GPU execution, which can significantly speed up the deep learning model's inference time.

The regions of the images most informative for the decision-making process in the deep learning model were visualized using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM). As an output, heatmaps were generated that indicated important aspects of the each head capsule used to determine the taxonomic decision-making process of the model. These heatmaps can be used to gain insights into the model's decision-making process and can be a useful tool for validating the model's performance.

In summary, the deep learning model was trained using a two-stage process, serialized using the Keras library, and deployed on the TensorFlow platform, which offers GPU execution. The model's decision-making process was visualized using Grad-CAM, which generated heatmaps indicating important aspects of the each head capsule used to determine the taxonomic decision-making process of the model.
