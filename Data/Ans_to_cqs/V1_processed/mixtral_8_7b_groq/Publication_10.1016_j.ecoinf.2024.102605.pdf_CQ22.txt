The performance of the deep learning model, a 1D-CNN algorithm, is evaluated using two metrics: overall accuracy (OA) and the kappa coefficient. These metrics are used to assess the model's ability to identify the degree of damage to forest trees by EJD (a pest) in June, August, and September.

Overall Accuracy (OA) is a common metric for evaluating the performance of classification models. It is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of input samples. In this study, the overall accuracy of the 1D-CNN model is 89.50%, indicating that the model correctly classifies 89.50% of the input samples.

The kappa coefficient is another metric used to evaluate the performance of the model. It measures the agreement between the predicted classifications and the actual classifications. The kappa coefficient ranges from -1 to 1, where a value of 1 indicates perfect agreement, a value of 0 indicates agreement no better than chance, and a negative value indicates less agreement than chance. In this study, the kappa coefficient is 0.8666, indicating a high level of agreement between the predicted and actual classifications.

These two metrics, overall accuracy and kappa coefficient, provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance in identifying the degree of damage to forest trees by EJD. The high values of these metrics suggest that the 1D-CNN model performs well in this task. However, other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
