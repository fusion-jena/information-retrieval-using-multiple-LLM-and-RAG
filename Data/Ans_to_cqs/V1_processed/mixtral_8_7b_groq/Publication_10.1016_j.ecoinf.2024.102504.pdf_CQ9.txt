Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study by Navares and Aznarte (2020). The study by Navares and Aznarte (2020) titled "Predicting air quality with deep learning LSTM: Towards comprehensive models" discusses the use of a deep learning long short-term memory (LSTM) model for predicting air quality. However, the context does not mention where the data repository for this study is available.

It is possible that the data repository is not publicly available or was not specified in the study. In such cases, it is recommended to contact the authors directly to inquire about the data availability and access.

Additionally, the other studies provided in the context do not mention the data repository for any deep learning pipeline. These studies focus on different aspects of air quality, such as air pollution in Budapest (Neckel et al., 2023), nitrogen dioxide levels as a contributing factor to COVID-19 fatality (Ogen, 2020), carbon sequestration in fly ash deposits (Pandey, 2020), and health risks of particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide (Costa et al., 2014). While these studies may use data repositories, they are not related to the deep learning pipeline used in the study by Navares and Aznarte (2020).

Therefore, the answer to the query is that there is no information available about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study by Navares and Aznarte (2020). It is recommended to contact the authors directly for data availability and access.
