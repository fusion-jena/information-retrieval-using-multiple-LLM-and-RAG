The provided context does not give specific information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it is common practice in machine learning to split the data into three sets: training, validation, and testing.

The training set is used to train the model, i.e., to adjust the model's parameters to minimize the error on the training data. The validation set is used to tune hyperparameters, such as the learning rate or the number of layers in the model. The model is trained on the training set, and its performance is evaluated on the validation set. This process is repeated with different hyperparameters until a satisfactory performance on the validation set is achieved.

Finally, the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. This is important to ensure that the model can generalize well to new data and has not simply memorized the training data.

In the context provided, it can be inferred that the data was split into training and validation sets, as the model's performance on both sets is reported. Specifically, the chosen model had an F1-score of 92.75% on the training set, indicating that the trained CNN was very accurate in its predictions. However, the size of the validation set and the criteria used to split the data are not provided.

It is also worth noting that the context discusses the use of transfer learning, which involves initializing the model's weights with pre-trained weights from a different task or dataset. This can be a useful strategy when the amount of available data is limited, as it allows the model to leverage knowledge from a related task. However, it is still important to evaluate the model's performance on a separate testing set to ensure that it can generalize well to new data.
