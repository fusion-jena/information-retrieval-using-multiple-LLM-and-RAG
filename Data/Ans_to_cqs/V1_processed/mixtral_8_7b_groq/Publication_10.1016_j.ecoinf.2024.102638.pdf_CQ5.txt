The information provided does not directly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for Earth system science. However, it does give some insights into the types of data and variables that could be included in such datasets.

The paper by Reichstein et al., 2019 discusses the application of deep learning techniques to data-driven Earth system science. While they don't specify the exact datasets used, they mention that their approach involves integrating multi-sensor Earth observations, which could include data from satellites, ground stations, and other sources.

The paper by Ryu et al., 2012 focuses on the temporal upscaling of evapotranspiration from instantaneous remote sensing measurements to 8-day mean daily-sums. The dataset used in this study includes half-hourly flux measurements of evapotranspiration, radiation, and other related variables.

The study by Schwank et al., 2012 investigates the L-band radiative properties of vine vegetation at the MELBEX III SMOS cal/val site. The dataset used here includes L-band brightness temperature measurements, soil moisture data, and vegetation information.

From these papers, we can infer that the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for Earth system science might involve various Earth observation data, such as remote sensing measurements, meteorological data, and flux measurements. These datasets could include variables such as soil moisture, pressure, precipitation, air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, global/reflected/atmospheric/emitted radiation, sensible/latent heat flux, and carbon dioxide flux.

It is important to note that the deep learning models used in these studies would require large and diverse datasets to effectively learn the complex relationships between the various Earth system variables. Therefore, the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for Earth system science are likely to be extensive and comprehensive, incorporating data from multiple sources and spanning a wide range of temporal and spatial scales.

In summary, while the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for Earth system science are not provided in the given context, we can infer that these datasets are likely to consist of multi-sensor Earth observations, encompassing a variety of Earth system variables.
