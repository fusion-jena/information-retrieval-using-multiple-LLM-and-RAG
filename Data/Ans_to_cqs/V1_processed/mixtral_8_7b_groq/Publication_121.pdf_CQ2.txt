The context provided focuses on the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for tree species identification, with a specific emphasis on a lightweight model for handheld devices. The training and test data used in this study consist of images, as indicated by the mention of "images" being divided into a training set and a test set, and the use of remote sensing or handheld devices for image acquisition.

The pre-trained models used in the study were obtained from the ImageNet dataset, which is a large-scale image recognition dataset that contains 1.4 million images across 1000 classes. This suggests that the pre-trained models were trained on image data, and the feature extraction process involved using the bottleneck layer output from these pre-trained models.

There is no explicit mention of other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV being used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be concluded that the deep learning pipeline involves the use of image data.
