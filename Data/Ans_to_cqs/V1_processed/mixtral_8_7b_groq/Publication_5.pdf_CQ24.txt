The provided context discusses the use of dropout as a strategy to handle randomness in deep learning models. Dropout is a technique used to prevent neural networks from overfitting by randomly dropping out, or "turning off," a proportion of the network's neurons during training (Srivastava et al., 2014). This introduces randomness into the model by breaking up co-adaptations between neurons, which can improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

In the context, dropout is mentioned as a simple way to prevent neural networks from overfitting, but the specific details of its implementation in the deep learning pipeline are not provided (Srivastava et al., 2014). However, it is likely that dropout was used during the training process of the deep learning model described in the context.

In addition to dropout, there are other strategies that can be employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. One such strategy is the use of a random seed value. A random seed value is a starting point for the random number generator used in the model, and it ensures that the same sequence of random numbers is generated each time the model is trained (Chollet, 2018). This can be useful for reproducibility, as it allows researchers to reproduce the same results when training the model multiple times.

Furthermore, the context also mentions the use of a grid search to determine the best values of the hyperparameters in the random forest regression model. A grid search involves training the model multiple times with different combinations of hyperparameter values and selecting the combination that results in the best performance (Chollet, 2018). The use of a grid search introduces randomness into the model selection process, as different combinations of hyperparameter values may result in different models being selected.

In summary, the provided context discusses the use of dropout as a strategy to handle randomness in deep learning models. Additionally, other strategies such as the use of a random seed value and a grid search can also be employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
