The provided context discusses the pre-processing block of a deep learning model based on a residual network or ResNet, but it does not go into specific details about the preprocessing steps involved. However, it can be inferred that some preprocessing steps were applied before training the model.

The input to the model is a single channel mel spectrogram of size 64 Ã— 384, visualizing three seconds of audio at a sampling rate of 48 kHz. This suggests that the audio signals were converted to the frequency domain using a mel spectrogram, which is a common preprocessing step for audio signals.

Furthermore, the context mentions that the original input spectrogram was transformed before it was passed through a series of residual stacks. However, the specifics of this transformation are not provided. It could include steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning, which are common preprocessing steps in deep learning.

Normalization is a preprocessing step that scales the input data to a similar range to improve the model's training. Scaling is another preprocessing step that changes the range of the input data, often to a standard range such as [0,1] or [-1,1]. Cleaning is a preprocessing step that removes noise or outliers from the input data.

Therefore, while the provided context does not give specific details about the preprocessing steps involved, it can be inferred that some preprocessing steps, such as mel spectrogram conversion, normalization, scaling, or cleaning, were applied before training the deep learning model.
