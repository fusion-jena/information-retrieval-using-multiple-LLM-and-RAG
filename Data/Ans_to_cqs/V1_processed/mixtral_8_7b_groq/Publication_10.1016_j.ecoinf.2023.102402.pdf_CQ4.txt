Based on the provided context, there is no information about the specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline for seahorse data. The context focuses on the use of data from various sources, such as citizen science surveys, social media, and scientific data sharing, to study seahorse occurrences and ecological niches. It describes the creation of a global-scale dataset with a spatial resolution of 5 arcmin, using benthic layers and a bathymetric layer for predictor variables. However, it does not mention any data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
