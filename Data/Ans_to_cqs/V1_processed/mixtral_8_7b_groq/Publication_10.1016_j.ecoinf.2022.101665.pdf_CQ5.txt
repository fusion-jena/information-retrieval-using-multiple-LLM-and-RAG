The provided context does not include information about the use of deep learning models such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it focuses on the evaluation of thematic maps produced by a calibrated statistical prediction method, particularly in a context where data availability is limited.

The datasets used in this study are related to environmental variables, Earth observation imagery, climatic data, and terrain variables derived from digital elevation models. These datasets are used to predict variables like above-ground biomass, soil carbon stock, and land cover change. The specific datasets include:

1. A compiled version of the datasets used in this paper, available for download from: <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6513429>.
2. Analysis scripts are available at: <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6514923>.
3. Elevation data used to compute slope, aspect, topographic position index, terrain ruggedness index, and topographic wetness index, computed at 25 m resolution and aggregated to 0.5 km.
4. Forest height data from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) dataset, using a mask created from other covariates.
5. X and Y coordinate data, distance from coast, and spatial configuration of observed above-ground biomass (AGB) pixels in central Africa.

These datasets are used to assess the accuracy of a thematic map, specifically focusing on the testing phase of the machine learning process. Since data availability is often limited, resampling methods are used instead of setting aside a test set.

In summary, the provided context discusses the evaluation of thematic maps for environmental variables using machine learning techniques and resampling methods. The context does not mention any of the deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
