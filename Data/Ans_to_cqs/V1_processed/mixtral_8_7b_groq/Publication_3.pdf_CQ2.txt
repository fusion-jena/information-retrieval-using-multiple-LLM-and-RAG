The data format used in the deep learning pipeline described in the given context is audio. This is evident from the description of the research, which involves the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for species identification based on audio recordings of bird songs.

The researchers generated spectrograms from the audio recordings, which were then subjected to identification using the CNN. Spectrograms are a visual representation of the frequency content of a signal as it varies with time, and are commonly used in audio signal processing and machine learning applications involving audio data.

The data used in the study was obtained from Cornell Universityâ€™s Laboratory of Ornithology and Macaulay Library of Natural Sounds, and was publicly available. The researchers increased the number of species in the TensorFlow reference library to 41 by adding 21 new, undescribed species, and generated 20 spectrograms per species for a new dataset, resulting in a total of 440 spectrograms.

In summary, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline described in the given context is audio, specifically in the form of spectrograms generated from audio recordings of bird songs.
