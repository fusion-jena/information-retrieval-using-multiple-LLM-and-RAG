The provided context does not give specific information about the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data from AVHRR sensors and meteorological data from stations throughout China. NDVI data is often provided in raster format, which is a grid of cells where each cell contains a value representing vegetation health. Meteorological data could be provided in various formats, such as CSV (Comma Separated Values) files, which are commonly used for tabular data.

In addition, the context mentions the use of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) daily burned area data in a different study. MODIS data is also often provided in raster format.

Therefore, while the provided context does not give a definitive answer to the query, it can be inferred that raster data formats (such as those used for satellite imagery) and tabular data formats (such as CSV) are commonly used in deep learning pipelines for ecological research. Other data formats, such as audio and video, are not mentioned in the provided context.
