The deep learning model in question, referred to as BatNet and incorporated into the software Waveman, is designed for the purpose of automatic standardized processing and identification of tropical bat calls. More specifically, it is used for classification of bat calls.

The model consists of 22 convolutional layers for extracting useful acoustic features from spectrum images, and eight shortcut connections between layers to avoid information loss as the number of layers increases. The network is optimized for the specific task of processing and identifying tropical bat calls.

The model is trained using a reference dataset, and the training process involves optimizing the parameters of the model to extract acoustic features from the spectrum images with high efficiency. This results in higher accuracy for the classification of bat calls.

In addition, new BNorm layers were added behind the convolutional layers to prevent overfitting during the training process. This allows the model to generalize from trends in both known and unknown datasets, rather than maximizing performance on the training datasets alone.

The batch size was set to 128, which means that the model is trained using 128 images at a time. This is done to limit the volume of images used for training, as computers have limited random access memory or graphic memory.

In summary, the deep learning model BatNet is designed for the classification of tropical bat calls. It is optimized for this task through the use of convolutional layers, shortcut connections, and batch training with a reference dataset. The addition of BNorm layers helps to prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize from trends in both known and unknown datasets.
