The pieces of context provided do not give specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for audio enhancement. However, they do mention that deep learning-based denoising methods have been applied with great success in natural language processing and bioacoustics applications.

In general, optimization techniques are crucial in training deep learning models as they help to minimize the loss function and find the optimal set of model parameters. Some commonly used optimization techniques include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad.

For instance, Defossez et al. (2020) demonstrated the potential for deep noise reduction techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance in human speech enhancement. Although the specific optimization technique used in their study is not mentioned, they mentioned that their method operates in real-time on limited hardware. This implies that they might have used an optimization technique that converges faster and requires less computational resources.

On the other hand, Cao et al. (2022) developed a Conformer-based audio enhancement model called CMGAN that operates in the time-frequency domain. They fine-tuned the pre-trained CMGAN model using a maximum of 1000 five-second noisy and clean samples. However, the optimization technique used in their study is not specified.

Therefore, while the pieces of context provided do not give specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for audio enhancement, it is clear that optimization techniques are crucial in training deep learning models for audio enhancement tasks.
