The provided context does not explicitly mention the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) is a centralized data repository containing 65,000 datasets of 2 billion species observations. It is possible that the deep learning pipeline data was deposited in GBIF, but this is not explicitly stated in the context.

Additionally, the context mentions that the data was filtered from GBIF using specific criteria, such as tree species observed in North America since 1990 with coordinate uncertainty less than 1000 m. However, it does not mention any other repositories where the data may be found.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the data repository for the deep learning pipeline is likely GBIF, but this is not definitively stated.
