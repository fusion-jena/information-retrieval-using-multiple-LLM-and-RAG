Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The text by Benkendorf and Hawkins (2020) discusses the effects of sample size and network depth on a deep learning approach to species distribution modeling, but it does not specify the optimization techniques employed.

In general, optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to update the model's parameters during training. These techniques help minimize the difference between the predicted and actual values, thus improving the model's performance.

Without specific information from the given context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer regarding the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is important to note that the choice of optimization technique can significantly impact the training process and the final model's performance. Therefore, it is a crucial aspect of deep learning model development.
