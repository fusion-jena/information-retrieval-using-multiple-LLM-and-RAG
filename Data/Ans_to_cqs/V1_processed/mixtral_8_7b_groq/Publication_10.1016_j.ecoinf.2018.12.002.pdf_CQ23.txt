Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the use of a deep learning model and the measures taken to ensure its generalizability such as a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, there are some general recommendations and techniques mentioned in the context that could be applied when developing a deep learning model to ensure its generalizability.

One such technique is the use of multiple machine learning algorithms and their ensembles, as mentioned in the context. This can help to reduce the variance of the model and improve its accuracy. In addition, it is suggested that for a specific behavioral category, random forests may have undesired performance, which implies that other algorithms should be considered.

Another technique mentioned in the context is the use of hidden Markov models (HMMs) for classifying movement behavior in relation to environmental conditions. HMMs are a type of probabilistic model that can capture the temporal dependencies in the data, which can be useful for modeling movement data.

The context also mentions the use of state-space models for bio-loggers, which can account for the errors in the data collection process. This can help to improve the accuracy of the model by accounting for measurement errors and uncertainties.

Finally, the context mentions the use of approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) for signal extraction from long-term ecological data. ABC is a Bayesian method that can be used to estimate the posterior distribution of the model parameters, even when the likelihood function is intractable. This can help to improve the generalizability of the model by accounting for the uncertainty in the parameter estimates.

In summary, while there is no specific information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, the context provides some general recommendations and techniques that could be applied, such as the use of multiple machine learning algorithms and their ensembles, hidden Markov models, state-space models, and approximate Bayesian computation.
