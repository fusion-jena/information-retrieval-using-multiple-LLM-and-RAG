The provided context does not give specific information about techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some data preprocessing techniques that were used in the study. These include using the top 3680 labels (around 60% of all labels) with more than 12 images in the training dataset, automatically retrieving the first 10 images returned by the Google Image Search engine for each label, and initializing the weights of the model with pretrained weights on the ImageNet dataset.

In general, techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline include:

* Stratified splitting: This is a method of sampling that aims to ensure each fold is a good representative of the whole. Particularly useful when the dataset is imbalanced.
* Oversampling: This is a method of balancing the dataset by duplicating samples from the minority class.
* Undersampling: This is a method of balancing the dataset by removing samples from the majority class.
* Diverse data collection: This is a method of collecting data from various sources and ensuring that the data is representative of the population.

It is possible that one or more of these techniques were used in the study, but the context does not provide enough information to confirm this.
