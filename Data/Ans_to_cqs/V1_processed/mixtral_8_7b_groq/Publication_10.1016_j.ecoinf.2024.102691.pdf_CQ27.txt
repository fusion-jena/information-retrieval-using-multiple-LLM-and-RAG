Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, we can infer some steps that might have been taken based on common deep learning practices.

After training the model, the first step would typically be model serialization, which involves saving the model's architecture, learned weights, and other relevant information into a file. This file can then be used to recreate the model without having to repeat the training process. The context does not specify which format was used for model serialization, but popular choices include HDF5, JSON, and XML.

Once the model is serialized, the next step would be platform selection. This involves choosing the hardware and software environment where the model will be deployed. The context does not provide information about the platform used, but options include cloud-based services (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud), local servers, or embedded devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi).

After selecting the platform, the model would need to be integrated with the chosen platform's software environment. This might involve writing code to load the serialized model, prepare input data, run predictions, and handle outputs. The context does not provide information about the programming language or software framework used for integration. However, since the model is based on YOLOv5, popular choices for deep learning frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras.

Finally, the deployed model would need to be tested and validated to ensure it performs as expected in the new environment. This might involve comparing the deployed model's predictions with ground truth data or evaluating other performance metrics.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, we can infer that it likely involved model serialization, platform selection, integration with the chosen platform's software environment, and testing/validation.
