Based on the provided texts, there is no direct information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. However, some related concepts can be found in the context of soil classification, irrigation scheduling, and visualization tools.

In the text "Principles of irrigation and scheduling for vegetable crops in Georgia" by da Silva et al., 2019, there is a discussion on irrigation scheduling based on soil water content and thresholds. This concept is related to the training process in machine learning, where the goal is to optimize a model's performance based on a validation metric. In this case, the training process could be considered complete when the validation loss reaches a plateau or when there is no significant improvement in the validation metric after a certain number of iterations.

The text "Understanding Soil Water Content and Thresholds For Irrigation Management" by Datta et al., 2017, further discusses the importance of soil water content and thresholds in irrigation management. This idea can be related to the early stopping technique in machine learning, where the training process is halted before the model starts overfitting if the validation loss starts increasing or stops decreasing significantly.

The text "Pi-VAT: A web-based visualization tool for decision support using spatially complex water quality model outputs" by Deval et al., 2022, introduces a visualization tool for water quality model outputs. Although not directly related to the training process, visualization tools can be helpful in monitoring the training progress and determining when the training is complete.

In summary, while there is no direct information on the criteria used to determine when training is complete, the concepts of validation loss plateau, early stopping, and visualization tools can be applied to determine when the training process is complete in machine learning.
