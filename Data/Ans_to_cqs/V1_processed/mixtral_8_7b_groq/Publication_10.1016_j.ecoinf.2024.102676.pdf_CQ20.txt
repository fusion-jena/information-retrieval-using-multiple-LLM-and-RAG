The provided context does not give specific details about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It is possible that the authors used Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) to train their deep learning model, as these are commonly used for machine learning tasks due to their ability to perform parallel processing. However, without explicit information, it is impossible to give a definitive answer.
