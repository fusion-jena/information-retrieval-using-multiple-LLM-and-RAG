However, we can infer some practices that might have been employed to enhance the deep learning model's generalizability. First, the dataset used in the study consisted of 6936 tagging events from three treatments, which could indicate a certain level of diversity in the data. Second, the R package glmmTMB was used to fit the model, which is a generalized linear mixed model that can handle complex data structures and potentially improve model performance. Lastly, the R package DHARMa was used to evaluate the fit of the GLMM, which includes simulation-based dispersion and outlier tests that could help identify potential issues in the model.
