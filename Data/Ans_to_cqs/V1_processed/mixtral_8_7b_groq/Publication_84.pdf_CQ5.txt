Based on the provided context, the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for the study of Spartina alterniflora invasion are not explicitly mentioned. The study focuses on comparing the performance of a deep learning method, Stacked AutoEncoder (SAE), and a traditional machine learning method, Support Vector Machine (SVM), for Landsat image classification. However, the specific names or sources of the Landsat images used in this study are not given.

In general, the choice of datasets for deep learning pipelines depends on the specific task and application. Some popular datasets used for training and evaluating deep learning models in various domains include:

1. MNIST: a dataset of handwritten digits (0-9) commonly used for image classification tasks.
2. CIFAR: a collection of image datasets used for object recognition and image classification tasks.
3. ImageNet: a large-scale dataset of images, with over 14 million images, used for object detection, image classification, and other vision tasks.
4. Landsat: a series of Earth observation satellites operated by NASA and the USGS, providing multispectral images of the Earth's surface.

For the study of Spartina alterniflora invasion, Landsat images are a suitable choice as they provide multispectral data that can be used to extract spectral-phenological features for deep learning. However, the specific Landsat images used in the study are not provided in the context.
