Based on the provided context, it is not explicitly stated which measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that the model performance was evaluated using a leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) approach. This method involves training the model on all but one observation and then testing it on the excluded observation, repeating this process for each observation in the dataset. LOOCV can help to provide a more reliable estimate of the model's performance and reduce overfitting, which can improve the model's generalizability.

Furthermore, the context states that the GEDI data and field data were compared to understand the relationship between GEDI AGBD and height with respect to the corresponding field-based values. This comparison could have been used as a way to validate the model's performance and ensure that it is generating reasonable estimates.

However, there is no mention of other measures such as using a diverse dataset, stratified splitting, or other techniques commonly used in deep learning to improve generalizability. Therefore, while LOOCV was used to evaluate the model's performance, it is unclear if any other measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
