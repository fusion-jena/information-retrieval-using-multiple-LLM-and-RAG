The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a method that controls variables. This approach involves keeping other variables constant and selecting the parameters that optimize the validation data forecast results as the model’s hyperparameters. However, the context does not explicitly mention whether a grid search, random search, or any other specific method was used.

In the process of optimizing the model, the researchers determined the structure of all models, including hyperparameters such as kernel size and number of nodes, by assessing the effectiveness of validation data forecasts using data from points A, B, and C. The solver used for training the network was found to be most effective when using Adam, as it resulted in a lower RMSE for the validation data forecasting results in the majority of cases.

Further sensitivity experiments were conducted to investigate the impact of different parameters on the hybrid CNN-LSTM model. These experiments revealed that the most critical factor affecting the model’s forecasting performance in the region with high Chl concentrations (point A) was the Chl parameter. In contrast, in the region with low Chl concentrations (point C), the Wind-U and Current-U parameters were identified as the primary factors affecting model accuracy. In the medium-value region (point B), the absence of the Wind-U parameter increased RMSE, though the impact was more pronounced in the low Chl concentrations region.

While the specific method used for hyperparameter optimization is not mentioned, it is clear that the researchers systematically evaluated different parameters and their combinations to determine the optimal hyperparameters for their model. This process of controlling variables and assessing validation data forecasts allowed them to identify the key parameters influencing the model’s performance and to select the optimal hyperparameters based on these findings.
