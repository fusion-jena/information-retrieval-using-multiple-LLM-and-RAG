Based on the provided sources, there is no explicit information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, some of the sources discuss the evaluation of models and their performance in the context of analyzing vegetation and land-cover change in different regions of China.

For instance, Stow et al. (2004) evaluate the performance of a model by comparing the simulated results with the actual measurements of vegetation and land-cover change in Arctic tundra ecosystems. Similarly, Sun et al. (2011) assess the accuracy of a model by comparing the predicted vegetation patterns with the observed patterns in the lower Tarim River, China using MODIS NDVI data.

Xu and Wang (2016) evaluate the performance of their model by comparing the simulated results with the actual measurements of plant productivity in the arid region of northern China under altered precipitation regimes. Moreover, Sun et al. (2016) assess the performance of their climate productivity model by comparing the simulated results with the actual measurements of grassland net primary productivity in southern China from 2000 to 2011.

Wang et al. (2021) detect forest decline patterns using tree rings and NDVI data and evaluate the performance of their model by comparing the simulated results with the actual measurements of forest decline patterns.

Therefore, while there is no explicit information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training, it can be inferred that the authors evaluate the performance of their models by comparing the simulated results with the actual measurements of vegetation and land-cover change in different regions of China.
