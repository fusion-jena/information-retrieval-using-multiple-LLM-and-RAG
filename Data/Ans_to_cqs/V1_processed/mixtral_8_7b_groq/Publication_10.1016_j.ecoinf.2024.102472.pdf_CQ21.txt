Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about specific postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix after the model training. However, it does mention that the trained network was used for feed-forward predictions on continuous spatial data. This implies that the model's performance was evaluated in some way, even if the methods used are not specified.

In general, after training a model like a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network, there are several common postprocessing steps:

1. **Model Evaluation**: This involves testing the model's performance on a separate validation or test dataset that was not used during training. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or mean squared error (MSE) can be calculated to assess the model's performance.

2. **Confusion Matrix**: If the problem is a classification problem, a confusion matrix can be created to visualize the performance of the model. It shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

3. **Saliency Maps**: These are used to visualize the importance of different input features in the model's decision-making process. They can help in understanding which features the model is focusing on and can be useful for feature selection or interpretation of the model.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Even though the context mentions that all hyperparameters were tuned with a grid search method during training, it's worth noting that hyperparameter tuning can also be done after training as part of the postprocessing steps. Techniques like Bayesian Optimization or Random Search can be used to further optimize the model's performance.

5. **Model Interpretation**: This involves understanding how the model is making its predictions. Techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) or LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) can be used for this purpose.

Given the context, it's likely that some form of model evaluation was performed, but the specific methods used are not mentioned.
