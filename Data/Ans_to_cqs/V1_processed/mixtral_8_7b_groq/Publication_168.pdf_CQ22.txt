The provided context discusses the use of three metrics to evaluate the classification performance of several methods, including some deep learning methods: average accuracy (AA), overall accuracy (OA), and kappa coefficient (K).

Average accuracy (AA) represents the average of each category's classification accuracies. It gives an idea of how well the model performs across all classes.

Overall accuracy (OA) is the proportion of correctly predicted samples in the total samples. It indicates the overall performance of the model.

Kappa coefficient (K) is a consistency test metric used to measure the classification accuracy. It considers the agreement between the predicted and actual classes, taking into account the possibility of the agreement occurring by chance.

However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of precision or recall as performance metrics for the deep learning models. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions, while recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positives in a specific class.

In summary, the provided context discusses the use of average accuracy (AA), overall accuracy (OA), and kappa coefficient (K) as performance metrics for the classification models, including some deep learning methods. Precision and recall are not explicitly mentioned as performance metrics for the deep learning models in the given context.
