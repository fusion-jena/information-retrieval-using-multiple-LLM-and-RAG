The context provided does not explicitly mention the specific data augmentation techniques used in the study. However, it does mention that data augmentation was used to enlarge the dataset and prevent overfitting. Common data augmentation techniques for image data include flipping, rotating, and scaling.

Flipping involves creating new images by horizontally or vertically flipping the original images. This helps the model to be invariant to the direction of the object in the image.

Rotating involves creating new images by rotating the original images by a certain angle. This helps the model to be invariant to the orientation of the object in the image.

Scaling involves creating new images by changing the size of the original images. This helps the model to be invariant to the scale of the object in the image.

It is likely that one or more of these techniques were used in the study, but without further information, it is not possible to say for certain.
