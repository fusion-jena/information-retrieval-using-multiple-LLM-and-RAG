The provided context does not include information about the specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on discussing the use of Big Data in analyzing environmental data, air pollution data, and the course of COVID-19 cases. It also explains the data processing results and analysis methods, including standardization as a preprocessing tool. However, it does not mention any data annotation techniques.

Data annotation techniques are essential in deep learning, especially in computer vision tasks. Some common data annotation techniques include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest in an image. It helps the deep learning model to locate and classify objects within the image.
2. Instance segmentation: This technique involves separating and classifying each instance of an object within an image. It provides a more detailed and precise annotation compared to bounding box annotation.
3. Semantic segmentation: This technique involves classifying each pixel within an image into a specific class. It is useful in applications where pixel-level accuracy is required, such as autonomous driving or medical image analysis.
4. Landmark annotation: This technique involves identifying and marking specific points or landmarks on an object within an image. It is useful in applications where the relative position of different parts of an object is important, such as facial recognition or pose estimation.

Without more context or information, it is not possible to determine which data annotation techniques were used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the query.
