The text provided discusses several techniques used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, albeit without explicitly naming dropout or L2 regularization. However, the described methods achieve similar goals of reducing overfitting and improving model generalization.



The primary regularization methods mentioned in the text are data augmentation, cross-validation, and using a suitable model architecture.

1. Data augmentation: This technique is used to artificially increase the size of the dataset by creating new samples from the existing ones. By applying various transformations such as random cropping, mosaic, color distortions (brightness, contrast, saturation, hue, Gaussian blur), random scaling, random rotation, and random horizontal flipping, the model is exposed to more variations. This helps the model generalize better and reduces the risk of overfitting.

2. Cross-validation: In this study, K-fold cross-validation was employed to ensure statistical results and prevent overfitting. By randomly shuffling the dataset and dividing it into training and evaluation sets K times, multiple models were trained on different versions of the dataset. The performance of these models was then averaged to better understand the model's capability on the dataset. Similar evaluation results from each model indicate that the model is more reliable on a wider range of input data.

3. Model architecture: The text mentions that two different versions of Faster R-CNN were created for the benchmark, Faster R-CNN (640) and Faster R-CNN (1280), both using Resnet50 as a backbone and pre-trained on ImageNet. After multiple tests, only the 1280 version was used in the benchmark due to inconclusive results from the 640 version. This suggests that the choice of model architecture and input dimensions can impact the model's performance and help prevent overfitting.

While the text does not explicitly mention dropout or L2 regularization, the described techniques achieve similar goals of reducing overfitting and improving model generalization.
