The provided context does not directly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of AutoML in deep learning, which is a method for automating the process of model selection and hyperparameter tuning.

In the context of AutoML, the data is divided into a training set, a validation set, and a test set. The training set is used to train candidate models, the validation set is used to compare the performance of the candidate models and select the best one, and the test set is used to evaluate the performance of the selected model.

In general, data annotation techniques used in deep learning include:

1. Image annotation: This involves labeling objects in images, such as using bounding boxes to identify specific objects or using pixel-level annotation for semantic segmentation.
2. Text annotation: This involves labeling text data, such as using named entity recognition to identify entities in a sentence or using part-of-speech tagging to identify the grammatical role of each word.
3. Speech annotation: This involves labeling audio data, such as using forced alignment to identify the timing of phonemes or using speaker diarization to identify different speakers in a recording.

The specific data annotation technique used depends on the type of data and the task at hand. For example, in computer vision tasks, image annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation may be used.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly mention data annotation techniques, it does discuss the use of AutoML in deep learning, which is a method for automating the process of model selection and hyperparameter tuning. In general, data annotation techniques used in deep learning include image annotation, text annotation, and speech annotation, with the specific technique depending on the type of data and the task at hand.
