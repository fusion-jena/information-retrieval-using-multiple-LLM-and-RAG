The text provided does not give specific details about the process of deploying the trained deep learning model after training. However, it does provide information about the training process and some steps that were taken before and during training.

During training, the proposed FAA-based approach divides the data into five equal folds and applies policies for data augmentation without repetition to each fold. The CNN model then processes the folds, and the Bayesian optimizer controls the output of each CNN. Weak policies are removed, and strong ones are selected in an ongoing process to find the optimal policies for data augmentation.

Before training, the authors of the text emphasize the importance of texture characteristics in identifying plants and suggest paying more attention to the modules that consider these characteristics. They also mention the use of data augmentation techniques to increase and diversify the training data to prevent overfitting.

As for model deployment, the text only mentions that the performance of the proposed models increases with the number of epochs and the amount of training data. It does not provide information on how the trained model was serialized or which platform was selected for deployment.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot provide a complete answer to the query regarding the process of deploying the trained deep learning model.
