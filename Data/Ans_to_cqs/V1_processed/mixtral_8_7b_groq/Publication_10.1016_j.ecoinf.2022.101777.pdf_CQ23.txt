Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, such as creating a diverse dataset, using cross-validation, or implementing stratified splitting. However, the context does discuss the racy assessment, which requires specific parameters for calculating the total number of training samples required for image classification using Eq. 1.

In the context, there is information about the measures taken to address the serious flooding problem in the Umia River Basin. These measures include infrastructure and natural water retention measures, such as land use conversion through afforestation to improve evapotranspiration, infiltration, and retention of water, land management practices that help increase the water holding capacity of soils and the reconnection of floodplains or ponds to rivers. These measures are aimed at improving the water management system in the Umia River Basin.

While these measures are not directly related to the generalizability of a deep learning model, they do highlight the importance of considering real-world context and data diversity when developing and training machine learning models. By incorporating diverse data sources and considering the complexities of real-world systems, researchers can improve the generalizability and applicability of their models.

Therefore, while the provided context does not directly answer the query about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, it does suggest that incorporating diverse data sources and considering real-world context can help improve the generalizability of machine learning models.
