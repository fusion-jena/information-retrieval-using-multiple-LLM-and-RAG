Based on the given context, there is no direct mention of data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. However, the context does discuss various methods and techniques used in the field of ecological informatics and machine learning, including different types of models and algorithms.

In the context of data augmentation techniques for image data, flipping, rotating, and scaling are common methods used to increase the size of the training set and improve the robustness of deep learning models. These techniques can help the model generalize better to new, unseen data by creating variations of the existing data.

Flipping refers to horizontally or vertically flipping an image, which can help the model learn features that are invariant to orientation. Rotating involves rotating an image by a certain angle, which can help the model learn features that are invariant to rotation. Scaling involves changing the size of an image, which can help the model learn features that are invariant to scale.

While these techniques are not explicitly mentioned in the given context, it is possible that they were used in the deep learning pipeline discussed in the study. However, without further information, it is not possible to confirm this.
