The text provided does not mention the use of any deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it discusses the application of the Random Forest (RF) machine learning method for classifying reproductive condition in fish, using data from Chilean hake (Merluccius gayi gayi). The RF method was used to predict the reproductive condition of fish based on gonad data randomly collected from commercial industrial and acoustic surveys. The data was classified into three maturity classes: immature, mature-active, and mature-inactive.

The text highlights the potential of using RFs for classifying maturity in other taxa whose reproductive attributes are essential for their management and conservation in the ecosystem. However, it does not mention any deep learning datasets or pipelines.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the provided text does not mention any deep learning datasets used in the pipeline.
