The postprocessing steps involved after the model training can vary depending on the specific techniques and objectives of the analysis. However, based on the provided context, some common postprocessing steps that could be involved after training the models mentioned are metrics calculation and the generation of a confusion matrix.

The first step, metrics calculation, involves evaluating the performance of the trained models using various metrics. These metrics can include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and root mean squared error (RMSE), among others. The optimal combination of hyperparameters for each model is determined based on these metrics, which are computed for each model generated during the training phase.

The second step, generating a confusion matrix, is a way to visualize the performance of a classification model. It is a table that summarizes the number of false positives, false negatives, true positives, and true negatives. From the confusion matrix, additional metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score can be calculated.

It is important to note that the provided context does not mention any specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps. Saliency maps are a technique used to visualize the importance of input features in the prediction made by a model. While saliency maps can be a useful tool for understanding the model's decision-making process, they are not explicitly mentioned in the context provided.

In summary, the postprocessing steps involved after training the models mentioned in the provided context primarily include metrics calculation and generating a confusion matrix. These steps help evaluate the performance of the models and provide insights into their classification abilities.
