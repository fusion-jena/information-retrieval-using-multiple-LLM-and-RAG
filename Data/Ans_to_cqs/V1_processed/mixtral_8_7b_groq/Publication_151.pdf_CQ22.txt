The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the deep learning model in terms of accuracy, precision, or recall. However, it does mention that the loss function decreases as the training epochs advance, and the training stops when the value of the loss function fails to decrease in two consecutive checks. The model with the optimal objective function value is then chosen. Therefore, it can be inferred that the loss function value is used to evaluate the performance of the model during the training process. Additionally, the context mentions that the number of errors is reported as an error metric for the placement of queries onto the reference tree. However, this error metric is related to the distance-based placement method used after the CNN model has been trained, not to the evaluation of the deep learning model itself.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention accuracy, precision, or recall as evaluation metrics for the deep learning model, it does mention the use of the loss function value and the number of errors as metrics for evaluating the model's performance during training and query placement, respectively.
