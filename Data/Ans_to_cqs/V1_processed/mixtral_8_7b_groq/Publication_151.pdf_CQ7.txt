The provided context does not give specific details about how the data is split for training the deep learning model. However, it does mention that they used simulated data sets to evaluate the DEPP (Deep Evolutionary Placement of New Taxa) method and started by training a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model. The training process involves using a running average of the recent magnitude of the data to speed up training, with a batch size of 32. The training loss is checked every 50 epochs, and the training is stopped when the loss function fails to decrease in two consecutive checks. The model with the optimal objective function value is chosen.

Additionally, the context states that they used a subset of the reference species as a validation set to tune the parameters for a given data set. They first trained the model using these selected species as testing data to tune the parameters and then trained one last time with all the data with the fine-tuned parameters. However, this process requires repeated training and can be slow.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for training, it can be inferred that they used a validation set to tune the parameters and possibly used a separate test set to evaluate the model's performance. However, the specific details of the data splitting criteria are not provided.
