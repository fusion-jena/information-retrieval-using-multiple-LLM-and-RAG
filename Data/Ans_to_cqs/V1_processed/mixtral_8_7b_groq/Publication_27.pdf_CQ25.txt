Based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model is object detection.

The context includes several references to object detection, such as "261" which is a common citation for the paper "You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection" by Joseph Redmon et al., which introduces a deep learning-based object detection system. Additionally, the context includes several mentions of the terms "bounding box" and "coordinates," which are commonly used in object detection to specify the location and extent of objects within an image.

Furthermore, the context includes a reference to the "YOLO" (You Only Look Once) model, which is a real-time object detection system that uses a single convolutional neural network (CNN) to simultaneously predict bounding boxes and class probabilities for multiple objects in an image. The YOLO model is designed to be fast and accurate, making it well-suited for real-time applications such as video surveillance and autonomous vehicles.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model is object detection, specifically using the YOLO model for real-time, accurate detection of multiple objects within an image.
