The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a convolutional neural network (CNN), specifically ResNet 100. This information is provided in the first sentence of the context, which states that "We used ResNet 100 as our classic deep-learning algorithm. Resnet is a convolutional neural network (CNN)...". CNNs are a type of deep learning model that are particularly well-suited for image classification tasks, as they are able to extract features from images and classify them based on those features. The ResNet architecture, which is a type of CNN, has been shown to achieve excellent results on image classification tasks, as evidenced by its victory in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Competition (ILSVRC) in 2015. The context also states that the ResNet architecture is "still one of the best classification algorithms, while being easy to use and implement." Therefore, it is clear that a CNN, specifically ResNet 100, is used in the pipeline.
