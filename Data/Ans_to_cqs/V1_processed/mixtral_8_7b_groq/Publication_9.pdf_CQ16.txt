The criteria for determining when training is complete are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that users should anticipate iteratively training models with different sized training datasets and parameters until suitable performance is achieved. This suggests that the training process may involve monitoring the performance of the model on a validation set and stopping the training when the performance plateaus or stops improving. In the context of image segmentation, a common metric for monitoring performance is Intersection over Union (IoU) score, which measures the overlap between the predicted segmentation mask and the ground truth mask. In the provided context, it is mentioned that all 190 validation images had mean IoU scores >50%, indicating excellent accuracy. Therefore, it is likely that the training process involves monitoring the IoU score on a validation set and stopping the training when the score plateaus or reaches a satisfactory level. Additionally, users are advised to consider the quality of their mask annotations and gather images representing high phenotypic and contextual visual diversity to enhance model generalizability and performance. Therefore, it can be inferred that the training process may also involve refining the mask annotations and gathering more diverse images to improve the model performance.
