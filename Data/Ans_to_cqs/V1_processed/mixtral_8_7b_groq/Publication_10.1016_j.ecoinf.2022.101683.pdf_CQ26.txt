The provided context discusses techniques used to address sampling bias in invasive Species Distribution Models (iSDMs), but it does not directly mention the deep learning pipeline or the specific techniques listed in the query. However, I can provide some relevant information related to data bias preprocessing techniques that are commonly used in machine learning, including deep learning.



In the context of machine learning and deep learning, data bias can be addressed during preprocessing using various techniques such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

1. Stratified sampling: Stratified sampling is a method used to ensure that the training and testing datasets are representative of the entire population. In this method, the data is divided into subgroups or strata based on specific criteria (e.g., class labels), and then a balanced number of samples are randomly selected from each stratum. This technique helps to maintain the class distribution and reduces bias in the dataset.
2. Oversampling: Oversampling is a technique used to increase the number of instances in the minority class to balance the dataset. This can be done by randomly duplicating instances from the minority class or by using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) that creates synthetic samples based on the feature space of the minority class. Oversampling helps to prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.
3. Undersampling: Undersampling is a technique used to decrease the number of instances in the majority class to balance the dataset. This can be done by randomly removing instances from the majority class. However, this technique may result in loss of valuable information. To overcome this, ensemble methods like EasyEnsemble and BalancedBagging can be used, which create multiple subsets of the majority class and build separate models for each subset.
4. Diverse data collection: Diverse data collection refers to gathering data from various sources, domains, or distributions. This technique helps to ensure that the dataset is representative of the real-world scenarios and reduces bias. In the context of iSDMs, diverse data collection can be achieved by gathering species occurrence data from different regions, habitats, or environmental conditions.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss the techniques mentioned in the query, it is essential to address data bias during preprocessing in machine learning and deep learning pipelines. Techniques such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection can help reduce bias and improve model performance.
