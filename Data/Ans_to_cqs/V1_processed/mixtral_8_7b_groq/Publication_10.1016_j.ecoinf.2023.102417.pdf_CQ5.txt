The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the provided context are ImageNet and the biomonitoring and remote sensing images. 

The study initially uses the well-established ImageNet dataset to pretrain the encoder weights of the Semantic Segmentation Model Unet. The ImageNet dataset is a large-scale image dataset that has been widely used for training and evaluating image classification models. It contains over 14 million images belonging to 1000 classes. Pretraining on this dataset helps improve the accuracy of the model, especially when trained on small-scale datasets like the biomonitoring and remote sensing images.

Further, the study focuses on small-scale remote sensing data obtained by hand-held camera devices. These datasets are used for the training and evaluation of the joint energy-based semantic segmentation model (JESS) for semantic segmentation of biomonitoring and remote sensing images. The study does not mention any specific names or sources for these datasets, but they are likely specific to the research conducted in this study.

Therefore, the two datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are ImageNet and the biomonitoring and remote sensing images.
