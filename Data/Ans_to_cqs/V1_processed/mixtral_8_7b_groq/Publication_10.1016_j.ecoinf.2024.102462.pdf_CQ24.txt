The provided context discusses the development of a deep learning model for sub-alpine shrub species identification, including fieldwork expeditions and an observer study. However, it does not directly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value.

In general, deep learning models often incorporate randomness during training for various purposes, such as initializing weights, dropout regularization, data shuffling, and mini-batch sampling. These techniques help improve model performance, prevent overfitting, and increase the robustness of the model.

In the context of this document, the following strategies might be employed to handle randomness:

1. Initializing weights: Deep learning models typically initialize weights randomly at the beginning of training. This random initialization ensures that the model does not start with identical weights for each neuron, allowing for a more diverse exploration of the solution space.
2. Data shuffling: During training, data is often shuffled randomly to ensure that the model does not learn patterns specific to a particular order of the training data. This strategy helps improve the generalization of the model.
3. Mini-batch sampling: When training deep learning models, it is common to process the training data in mini-batches. These mini-batches are randomly sampled from the training dataset, introducing randomness into the training process.
4. Dropout regularization: Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly drops out a fraction of neurons during training. This strategy helps prevent overfitting and encourages the model to learn more robust features.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention these strategies, they are common practices in deep learning and could be employed in this study.
