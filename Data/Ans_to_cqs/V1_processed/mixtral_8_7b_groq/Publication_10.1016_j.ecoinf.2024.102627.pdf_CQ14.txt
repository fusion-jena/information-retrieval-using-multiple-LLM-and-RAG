The text provided does not give a specific answer to how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, it does mention that the hyperparameter λ is estimated to be 8.75e-5 and that the average error rate is controlled on the validation set when testing if the correct species is returned within the assemblage thresholded with the hyperparameter λ. It can be inferred that there might be a process of tuning or optimizing the hyperparameter λ, but the specific method used is not mentioned. It could be a method such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization, but the text does not provide enough information to give a definitive answer.
