Based on the provided context, there is no information about the specific process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. The context mainly focuses on the use and evaluation of species distribution models in the field of ecology, including the impact of sample size, environmental covariates, and sampling bias on model performance.

However, I can provide a general overview of the steps typically involved in deploying a trained deep learning model:

1. Model serialization: This step involves saving the trained model to a file, allowing it to be stored and loaded later for deployment. Common formats for model serialization include HDF5, JSON, and Protocol Buffers.
2. Platform selection: The choice of platform for deploying the model depends on the specific use case and requirements. Common platforms for deep learning model deployment include local servers, cloud services (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud), and edge devices (e.g., mobile phones, IoT devices).
3. Model optimization: To ensure efficient deployment, the model may need to be optimized for the target platform. This can involve techniques such as quantization, pruning, and model distillation.
4. Integration with application: The deployed model is typically integrated with a larger application or system, which may involve building a web API, mobile app, or other user interface.
5. Monitoring and maintenance: After deployment, the model and application should be monitored for performance and accuracy, and periodic maintenance may be required to update the model or address any issues.
