The provided context does not contain information about the specific deep learning model or its hyperparameters. The text focuses on methods for assessing the accuracy of thematic maps produced by a calibrated statistical prediction method, using resampling methods due to limited data availability. It discusses various evaluation metrics such as RMSE and MEC, but does not mention any deep learning models or their hyperparameters. Deep learning models typically have several hyperparameters that can be tuned for better performance, such as learning rate, choice of optimizer, number of layers, and number of units in each layer. However, the specific hyperparameters would depend on the particular deep learning model and are not provided in this context.
