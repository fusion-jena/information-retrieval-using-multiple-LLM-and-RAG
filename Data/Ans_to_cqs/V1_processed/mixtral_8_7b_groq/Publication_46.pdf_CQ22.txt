The performance of the deep learning model, specifically the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), is evaluated using several metrics including the Area Under Curve (AUC), Kappa, and True Skill Statistics (TSS). 

The AUC is a measure of the model's ability to distinguish between true positive and false positive rates. It ranges from 0 to 1, with a higher value indicating better performance. In this case, the AUC value for the CNN model is 0.917, which is significantly higher than the AUC value of 0.68 for the BIOCLIM model.

The Kappa metric is a measure of the agreement between the predicted and actual values, taking into account the possibility of the agreement occurring by chance. It ranges from -1 to 1, with a value of 1 indicating perfect agreement. The Kappa value for the CNN model is 0.94, which is higher than the Kappa value of 0.76 for the BIOCLIM model.

The TSS metric is a measure of the model's overall accuracy, taking into account both false positive and false negative rates. It ranges from -1 to 1, with a value of 1 indicating perfect accuracy. The TSS value for the CNN model is 0.652, which is higher than the TSS value of 0.44 for the BIOCLIM model.

These metrics indicate the superiority of the CNN model over the BIOCLIM model in predicting the probability distribution of the species. The CNN model performs better in distinguishing between true positive and false positive rates, having a higher AUC value, and also in agreeing with the actual values, having a higher Kappa value. Additionally, the CNN model has a higher TSS value, indicating its overall accuracy in predicting the species distribution.
