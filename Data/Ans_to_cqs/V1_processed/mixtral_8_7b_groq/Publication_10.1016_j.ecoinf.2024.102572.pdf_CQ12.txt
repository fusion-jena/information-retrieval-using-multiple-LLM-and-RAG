The provided context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It only mentions the use of machine learning techniques and Python's Direct Application Programming Interface (API) for retrieving picture data and processing it. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine the specific type of deep learning model used, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers.
