I don't have the information to answer the query directly because the context provided is about a computational approach that combines least squares methods and genetic algorithms to estimate model parameters, and not about training a deep learning model. However, I can describe the general process of deploying a trained deep learning model based on common practices.



The process of deploying a trained deep learning model typically involves a few steps:

1. Model serialization: After training the deep learning model, the model's architecture, weights, and biases are saved to a file. This file can be used to recreate the model without having to retrain it. Common formats for model serialization include HDF5, JSON, and YAML.
2. Platform selection: The platform for deployment depends on the use case and the resources available. Common platforms for deep learning model deployment include local machines, cloud services, and edge devices.
3. Model conversion: Depending on the platform, the model may need to be converted to a format that the platform can use. For example, if deploying to a mobile device, the model may need to be converted to a format such as TensorFlow Lite.
4. Model optimization: To improve the model's performance on the target platform, the model may need to be optimized. This can include techniques such as quantization, pruning, and distillation.
5. Integration: The model is then integrated into the application or system that will use it. This can involve writing code to load the model, preprocess input data, and postprocess output data.
6. Testing: Finally, the model is tested on the target platform to ensure that it performs as expected.

In summary, while the provided context does not describe the process of deploying a trained deep learning model, the general process typically involves model serialization, platform selection, model conversion, optimization, integration, and testing.
