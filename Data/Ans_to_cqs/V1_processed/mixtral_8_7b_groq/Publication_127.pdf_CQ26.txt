The provided context does not contain specific information about techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that some datasets are split into training and test sets, which is a common practice in machine learning. To address data bias, techniques such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection can be employed during this splitting process.

Stratified sampling ensures that the train-test split maintains the original dataset's distribution of classes or labels. This method is useful when the dataset is imbalanced, i.e., one class has significantly more instances than the others. By using stratified sampling, the deep learning model gets exposed to a more representative sample of the data, reducing the risk of overfitting or underfitting to specific classes.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to balance the class distribution in a dataset. Oversampling involves duplicating instances from the minority class, while undersampling reduces the number of instances from the majority class. These techniques can help the model learn better by ensuring that each class has a roughly equal number of instances. However, oversampling might lead to overfitting, while undersampling might result in loss of valuable information.

Diverse data collection is another approach to addressing data bias. By collecting data from various sources, the model can learn a wider range of features and patterns, reducing the risk of overfitting to specific biases present in a single dataset.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention these techniques, they are common practices in deep learning to address data bias during preprocessing. These techniques include stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.
