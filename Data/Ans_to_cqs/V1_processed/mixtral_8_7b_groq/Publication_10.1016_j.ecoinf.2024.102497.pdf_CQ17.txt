The provided context discusses the use of machine learning techniques, specifically CART and Random Forest Regression (RFR), in bathymetry studies. However, it does not directly mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines such as dropout or L2 regularization.

In the context, the CART model builds a decision tree by selecting features and thresholds that minimize the variance of the target variable within each subset. To prevent overfitting and minimize cross-validation error, specific model parameters are fine-tuned, such as 'max_depth', 'min_samples_leaf', and 'max_leaf_nodes'. However, these are not regularization methods used in deep learning.

Similarly, the Random Forest Regression (RFR) model is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. The RFR algorithm constructs several independent decision trees by randomly sampling data and features. Each tree generates predictions, and the final regression result is obtained by aggregating predictions from all trees in the forest. The RFR model exhibits strong noise resilience and reduces the risk of overfitting. Fine-tuning the model parameters, such as 'n_estimators', is mentioned, but it is not a regularization method used in deep learning.

In summary, the provided context discusses the use of machine learning techniques, CART and RFR, in bathymetry studies. However, it does not directly mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines such as dropout or L2 regularization.
