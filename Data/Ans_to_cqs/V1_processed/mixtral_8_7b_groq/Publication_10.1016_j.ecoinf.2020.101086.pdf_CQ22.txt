The provided context does not give information about the evaluation of a deep learning model. Instead, it discusses the evaluation of different methods for correcting sampling bias in species distribution modeling. The metrics used for this evaluation are ΔAUC, ΔDenv, and ΔDgeo, which are defined in equations (6), (7), and (8) in the context.

ΔAUC is the change in the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which is a measure of the model's ability to distinguish between true presences and absences. ΔDenv is the change in the mean relative rank of each method for the environmental distance index (Denv), which measures the difference between the environmental conditions at the presence sites and the conditions at randomly selected background points. ΔDgeo is the change in the mean relative rank of each method for the geographical distance index (Dgeo), which measures the difference between the geographical coordinates of the presence sites and the background points.

These metrics are used to compare the performance of the different bias correction methods to an unbiased model output. The value of these metrics can range from negative infinity to 1. A negative value indicates that the biased model outperformed the corrected one, while a positive value indicates that the corrected model outperformed the biased one. A value of 1 indicates that the corrected model was perfectly corrected and was comparable to the unbiased one.

In summary, the provided context does not give information about the evaluation of a deep learning model, but it does discuss the evaluation of sampling bias correction methods in species distribution modeling using the metrics ΔAUC, ΔDenv, and ΔDgeo.
