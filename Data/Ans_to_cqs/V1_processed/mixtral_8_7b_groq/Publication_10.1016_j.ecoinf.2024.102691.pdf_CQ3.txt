In the context provided, there is no specific mention of data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide some common annotation techniques used in the field of computer vision and deep learning, which can be used for tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation.

One common annotation technique is bounding box annotation, where a bounding box is drawn around an object of interest in an image. This technique is often used for object detection tasks, where the goal is to locate and classify objects within an image. The bounding box annotations can be used as ground truth labels during the training of deep learning models, such as YOLO (You Only Look Once) or Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks).

Another annotation technique is instance segmentation, which involves labeling each pixel of an object of interest in an image. This technique provides more precise object boundaries compared to bounding box annotation. Instance segmentation can be used for tasks such as counting objects, measuring object sizes, or tracking objects over time. Common deep learning models used for instance segmentation include Mask R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks with Mask) and YOLACT (You Only Look At Coefficients).

Additionally, there is semantic segmentation, which involves labeling pixels in an image according to the object class they belong to, without distinguishing between different instances of the same class. Semantic segmentation can be used for tasks such as scene understanding, image editing, or autonomous driving. Common deep learning models used for semantic segmentation include U-Net, FCN (Fully Convolutional Networks), and DeepLab.

In the context of the Chen et al. (2021) paper, the authors use a bounding box annotation technique for apple detection. They use the des-YOLO v4 algorithm, which is an extension of the YOLOv4 algorithm, to detect apples in complex environments. The authors use bounding box annotations to train their deep learning model, where the ground truth labels are the bounding box coordinates and class labels of the apples in the input images.

Therefore, while the provided context does not specifically mention data annotation techniques, common techniques used in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation.
