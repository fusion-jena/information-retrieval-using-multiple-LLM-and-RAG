The pieces of context provided do not explicitly mention which deep learning framework was used to build the semantic segmentation or object detection models. However, it is mentioned that Python 3.8.0 was used for image processing, and Jupyter Notebook was used for running the image processing scripts. Both TensorFlow and PyTorch, two popular deep learning frameworks, have good support and integration with Python and Jupyter Notebook.
Considering the hardware configuration used for training the semantic segmentation model, specifically the Nvidia Tesla V100 GPU, it can be inferred that the deep learning framework used is likely to be TensorFlow or PyTorch, as these frameworks have good support for GPU acceleration and can utilize the CUDA cores and HBM2 memory available on the Nvidia Tesla V100 GPU.
In summary, while the pieces of context do not explicitly mention the deep learning framework used, it can be inferred that TensorFlow or PyTorch were likely used, considering the usage of Python, Jupyter Notebook, and the Nvidia Tesla V100 GPU for training.
