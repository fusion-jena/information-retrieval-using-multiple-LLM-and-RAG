The provided context discusses the use of deep learning models for the analysis of remote sensing data, but it does not explicitly list the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the models. However, it does mention that the studies using deep learning for remote sensing applications report precision indicators.

Precision, also known as positive predictive value, is the ratio of true positive predictions (relevant instances that are correctly identified) to the total predicted positives (relevant instances that are identified by the model, both true and false). It is a measure of the correctness of the model when it predicts a certain class.

In the context of remote sensing, accuracy metrics such as overall accuracy, producer's accuracy, and user's accuracy are commonly used to evaluate the performance of land use classification models. Overall accuracy is the ratio of the total number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions. Producer's accuracy is the ratio of the number of correctly identified instances of a certain class to the total number of instances of that class in the ground truth data. User's accuracy is the ratio of the number of correctly identified instances of a certain class to the total number of instances of that class predicted by the model.

Additionally, recall, also known as sensitivity, is another metric used to evaluate the performance of a model. Recall is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of actual positive instances. It measures the completeness of the model in identifying relevant instances.

These metrics, along with precision, can provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance. It is important to use a combination of these metrics to evaluate the model, as they provide different perspectives on the model's performance.
