The data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study by Celis et al. is not explicitly mentioned in the provided article abstract. However, it is mentioned that the original pictures and data from Finnmark and Yamal can be obtained from the authors upon request. Additionally, the Finnmark data is available from the Climate-Ecological Observatory for Arctic Tundra (COAT) database (doi:10.48425/6jytn3ga). The code and detailed instructions for the workflow are available on GitHub (<https://github.com/gerlis22/CameraTrap.git>).

It is not uncommon for research studies to use multiple repositories for different parts of the research, such as data, code, and other materials. While the abstract does not specify a repository for the deep learning pipeline, it is possible that the authors used a different repository for this specific component.

Therefore, it is recommended to contact the authors directly to inquire about the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. They can provide more information about where the data is stored and how it can be accessed. Additionally, the authors may be able to provide more context about the pipeline and how it was developed, which could be useful for researchers interested in replicating or building upon the study.

In summary, while the data repository for the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided article abstract, it is possible to obtain the original pictures and data from Finnmark and Yamal from the authors or the COAT database. The code and instructions for the workflow are available on GitHub. It is recommended to contact the authors directly for more information about the data repository for the deep learning pipeline.
