The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for wetland mapping. However, it does mention that the study utilizes remote sensing data for large-scale wetland mapping.

In the context, the authors propose a new deep learning model called "3DUNetGSFormer" for wetland mapping. They use this model to classify wetland areas in pilot sites, including Avalon, Grand Falls-Windsor, and Gros Morne National Park. The model is trained using a limited ground-truth dataset for large-scale wetland mapping.

The authors also compare the performance of their proposed model with other deep learning models, such as Vision Transformer (ViT), Swin Transformer, and CoAtNet. These models are commonly used in computer vision and remote sensing applications.

Therefore, while the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for wetland mapping are not explicitly mentioned, it can be inferred that the authors use remote sensing data for training and testing their deep learning models.

Moreover, the authors mention that transformers have been proven to be practical in remote sensing imagery classification. Transformers are a type of deep learning model that has been successful in natural language processing (NLP) and is now being explored in computer vision and remote sensing applications.

In summary, while the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for wetland mapping are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, it can be inferred that the authors use remote sensing data for training and testing their deep learning models. Additionally, transformers are mentioned as a deep learning model that has been successful in remote sensing imagery classification.
