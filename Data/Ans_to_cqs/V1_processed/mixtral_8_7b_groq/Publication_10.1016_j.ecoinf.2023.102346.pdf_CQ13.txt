The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of deep learning models for predictive analysis. The machine learning algorithms tested include Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), Random Forest (RF), Flexible Discriminant Analysis (FDA), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Generalized Boosting regression Model (GBM), and Maximum-Entropy learning (MAXENT). However, it does not specify any hyperparameters for these models.

Hyperparameters are configuration variables that are set before the learning process begins. They determine the structure of the model or the learning algorithm. Common hyperparameters for deep learning models include learning rate, number of layers, number of neurons per layer, activation functions, batch size, and optimization algorithms.

In the context, the "MAXENT" model is mentioned, which is a machine learning algorithm based on maximum entropy principles. It is not a deep learning model, and it has its own set of parameters, such as regularization, feature classes, and response distributions. However, the text does not provide specific details about these parameters.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
