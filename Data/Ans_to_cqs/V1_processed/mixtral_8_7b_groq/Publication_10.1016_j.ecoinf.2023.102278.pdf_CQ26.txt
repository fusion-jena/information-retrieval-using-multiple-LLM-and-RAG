The provided context does not give specific details about the data preprocessing techniques used to address data bias in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the dataset used in the study is unbalanced and has numerous classes nested inside each other in a taxonomic hierarchy. It also mentions the need for greater taxonomic resolution of classifications and the limitation of classification models relying on training data with species labels assigned to them.

The authors do not explicitly mention techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, they do mention using transfer learning with pre-trained weights from ImageNet, which can help mitigate issues related to small and unbalanced datasets.

In general, data preprocessing techniques used to address data bias include:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into subsets based on specific criteria, such as class labels, to ensure that each subset has a similar distribution of classes.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of instances in the minority class to balance the dataset.
3. Undersampling: This technique involves decreasing the number of instances in the majority class to balance the dataset.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from various sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention these techniques, they are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to address data bias.
