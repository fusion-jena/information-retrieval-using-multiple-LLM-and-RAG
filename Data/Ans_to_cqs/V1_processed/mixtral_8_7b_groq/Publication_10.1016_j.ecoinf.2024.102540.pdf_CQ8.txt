Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The context describes the use of deep learning techniques, specifically the YOLOv5 model family, for detecting alates on sorghum leaves. It also mentions that the authors trained five different versions of the YOLOv5 model. However, it does not provide any details about the code repository or where it can be found. Therefore, I am unable to answer this query without additional information.
