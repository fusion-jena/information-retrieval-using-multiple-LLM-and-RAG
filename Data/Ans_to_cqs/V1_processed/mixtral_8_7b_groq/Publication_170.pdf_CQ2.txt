The provided context discusses the use of deep learning in the classification of camera trap images for wildlife surveys. However, it does not explicitly mention other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV. Therefore, based on the given information, we can only confirm that image data is used in the deep learning pipeline.

In the study "Automatically identifying, counting, and describing wild animals in camera-trap images with deep learning" by Norouzzadeh et al. (2018), the authors use a dataset of camera-trap images to train a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) for wildlife detection and classification. The images are preprocessed to a fixed size and normalized before being fed into the DCNN.

The DCNN model used in the study is the AlexNet model, which includes five convolutional layers and three fully connected layers (Krizhevsky et al. 2012). Each layer performs Local Response Normalization (LRN) processing and Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function processing, except for the last fully connected layer. The first, second, and fifth convolutional layers also perform a downsampling operation using the mean pooling method.

Moreover, the study "ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks" by Krizhevsky et al. (2012) uses the ImageNet dataset, which contains over 1 million images belonging to 1000 categories. The authors use these images to train a DCNN for image classification.

Therefore, based on the given context, we can conclude that image data is used in the deep learning pipeline. However, we cannot confirm the use of other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV.
