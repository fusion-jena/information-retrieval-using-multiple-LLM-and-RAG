The provided context discusses the use of a deep learning model, specifically a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network, to predict the percent disease incidence of Cotton Leaf Curl Disease (CLCuD) in upland cotton. However, the context does not go into detail about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.

It is mentioned that the model was tested and validated for various activation functions as well as different testing and training data sets. This suggests that the model was evaluated for its performance and optimized before being deployed.

However, it is not specified whether the model was serialized, which is the process of saving the model's architecture and learned parameters to a file, so that it can be loaded and used later without having to retrain the model.

Additionally, the context does not provide information on the platform selection, such as whether the model was deployed on a local machine, a cloud-based platform, or an edge device.

Therefore, I don't have enough information to answer the query completely.
