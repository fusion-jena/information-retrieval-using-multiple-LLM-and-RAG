Based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning models mentioned is plant species classification. These models are used to identify and classify different plant species, particularly medicinal plants. For instance, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was proposed in a study to identify five medicinal plant species from a dataset of 750 image samples. Similarly, another deep learning-based method was proposed to automate plant species classification in the Borneo region. Furthermore, deep learning models have also been used for detecting diseases in single crop species and recognizing multiple disease varieties in a single crop. However, the context does not mention the use of deep learning models for tasks such as segmentation or object detection in plants. Therefore, based on the information provided, the primary purpose of these deep learning models is plant species classification.
