The text provided gives information about the development of a model for predicting Above Ground Biomass (AGB) using remote sensing data from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2. While the specific deep learning model used is not mentioned, the text does describe some measures that were taken to ensure the generalizability of the generated machine learning models.

Firstly, the model initially included all variables, and variable importance measures were employed to evaluate their significance. This step helped identify the most influential variables for predicting AGB, which is important for preventing overfitting and improving the model's ability to generalize.

Secondly, a stratified sampling method was applied to all AGB observations for evaluating model performance. This technique randomly allocated 70% of the samples to the training dataset and the remaining 30% to the validation dataset. Stratified sampling ensures that the training and validation datasets have similar proportions of samples for each class, which can help improve the model's ability to generalize.

Thirdly, three error statistics, specifically R2, mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE), were employed to compare the accuracies of the models. These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance, which is important for ensuring that the model can generalize well.

Finally, the generated machine learning models were extrapolated for the entire region. While this step is not explicitly described as a measure for improving generalizability, it is important for ensuring that the model can make accurate predictions for new, unseen data.

Therefore, while the text does not explicitly mention cross-validation or a diverse dataset, it does describe some measures that were taken to ensure the generalizability of the machine learning models. These measures include identifying important variables, using stratified sampling, evaluating model performance using multiple metrics, and extrapolating the model for the entire region.
