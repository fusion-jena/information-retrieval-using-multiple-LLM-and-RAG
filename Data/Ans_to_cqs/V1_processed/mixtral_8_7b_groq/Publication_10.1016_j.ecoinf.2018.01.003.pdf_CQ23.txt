Based on the information provided, there is no explicit mention of the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, it is stated that the BPNN model, which is a type of neural network, was used and optimized using 5-time cross-validation. Cross-validation is a commonly used technique to assess the performance and generalizability of a model by dividing the data into k subsets, or folds, and training and testing the model k times, with each fold serving as the test set once. This method can help reduce overfitting and provide a more reliable estimation of the model's performance on unseen data.

Additionally, the authors mention that the data from 2014 and 2015 were used as the test dataset, which suggests that the model was trained on data from earlier years and then tested on more recent data. Using a separate test set that was not used in the training process is another way to evaluate the generalizability of a model.

However, there is no information provided about the diversity of the dataset or the use of stratified splitting, which are other techniques that can help improve the generalizability of a model. Stratified splitting involves dividing the data into subgroups based on certain characteristics, such as class labels, and then randomly sampling from each subgroup to create the training and test sets. This can help ensure that the training and test sets have similar distributions of the characteristics of interest, which can improve the model's performance on new data.

In summary, while the information provided does not give a complete picture of the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, it does suggest that cross-validation and the use of a separate test set were used. However, there is no explicit mention of other techniques such as diverse dataset or stratified splitting.
