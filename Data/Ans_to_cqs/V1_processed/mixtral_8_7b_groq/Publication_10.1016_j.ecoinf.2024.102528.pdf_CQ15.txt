The provided context does not give specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for the studies mentioned. However, it is common for deep learning models to use optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, or RMSprop to minimize the loss function and improve the model's performance.

For instance, in the He et al. (2016) study on deep residual learning for image recognition, the authors do not explicitly mention the optimization technique used. However, it is likely that they used some form of gradient descent, such as SGD or Adam, as they are commonly used for training deep neural networks.

In the Kahl et al. (2021) study on BirdNET, a deep learning solution for avian diversity monitoring, the authors also do not specify the optimization technique used. Nonetheless, it is plausible that they utilized a standard optimization algorithm like Adam or SGD, given their application of deep learning models.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipelines, it is common practice to use optimization algorithms such as SGD, Adam, or RMSprop for training deep learning models.
