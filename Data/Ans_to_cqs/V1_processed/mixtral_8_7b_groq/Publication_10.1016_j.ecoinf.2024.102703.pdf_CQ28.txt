Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the specific platform that was used to deploy the deep learning model. The context consists mainly of research papers and articles related to aquatic ecology, limnology, and remote sensing, which do not mention or discuss the deployment platform for any deep learning models. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to this query.
