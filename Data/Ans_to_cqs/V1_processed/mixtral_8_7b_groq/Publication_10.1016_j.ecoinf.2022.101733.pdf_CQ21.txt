The postprocessing steps mentioned in the context occur after the model training and validation stages. However, they do not explicitly mention the specific postprocessing steps you inquired about, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Instead, they describe a different set of post-classification steps.

In the provided context, the post-classification steps involve processing the Region of Concern Map (RCM) using morphological operations. These operations include opening (erosion followed by dilation) and closing (dilation followed by erosion) using a structural element. These steps aim to remove small misclassified pixels or speckles and close gaps and holes in the classified map, enhancing spatial coherency. This process is repeated in an iteration loop of more than one iteration.

After the classification and post-classification steps, the dataset is divided into training and validation collections for both citrus and non-citrus categories. This division follows a 60%-40% ratio, resulting in "citrus-training", "citrus-validation", "non-citrus-training", and "non-citrus-validation" collections.

In summary, the provided context discusses post-classification steps involving morphological operations and dataset splitting for training and validation purposes. However, it does not mention the specific postprocessing steps you inquired about, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.
