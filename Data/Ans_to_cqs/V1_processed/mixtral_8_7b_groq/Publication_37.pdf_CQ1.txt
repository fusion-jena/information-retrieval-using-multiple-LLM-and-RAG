The provided context does not give specific details about how the raw data, in this case flight calls of migrating birds, were collected for the study. However, it is mentioned that the dataset consists of 5428 flight calls from 43 different species. Therefore, it can be inferred that the data was collected through a combination of methods, which may include surveys, sensors, and potentially public datasets.

Surveys could involve human experts who are trained to identify and record bird species' flight calls. Sensors could refer to automated audio recording devices placed in the birds' natural habitats to capture their vocalizations. Public datasets might have been used if there were any available that contained relevant bird flight call data.

In the context of this study, the authors focused on comparing two state-of-the-art classification techniques for large-vocabulary bird species classification from flight calls: a "shallow learning" unsupervised dictionary learning method and a deep convolutional neural network combined with data augmentation. The data collection method is not the main focus of the paper, but it is important to note that the choice of data collection method can impact the quality and quantity of the data, which in turn can affect the performance of the classification models.

In summary, while the provided context does not offer explicit information on the data collection methods for the bird flight call dataset, it can be assumed that a combination of surveys, sensors, and public datasets might have been used.
