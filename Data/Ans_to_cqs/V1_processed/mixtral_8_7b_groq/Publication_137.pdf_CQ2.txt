In the deep learning pipeline, point clouds are the primary data format used. Point clouds are a set of data points in a three-dimensional coordinate system. They are often used in 3D modeling, computer-aided design, and robotics.

In the context provided, point clouds are converted into a large number of 2D images to be processed by convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This is due to the fact that CNNs are widely used in 2D image processing, and the processing efficiency for point clouds is not yet ideal.

To convert point clouds into 2D images, the points at a range of a certain point are projected into a window image. Additionally, SnapNet proposed by Alexandre Boulch et al. converts point cloud data to snapshots, which are then handled in two types of images: RGB views and depth composite views with geometric features.

Therefore, in summary, the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline described in the context provided is point clouds, which are converted into 2D images for processing by CNNs.
