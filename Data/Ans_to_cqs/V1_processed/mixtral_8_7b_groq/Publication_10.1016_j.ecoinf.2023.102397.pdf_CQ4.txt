Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling being applied in the deep learning pipeline. Data augmentation techniques are commonly used in deep learning to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset, which can help improve the performance and generalization of the model. However, the context focuses mainly on the analysis of the effect of sample size and network depth on deep neural networks for species distribution modeling and the poor performance of acoustic indices as proxies for bird diversity in a fragmented Amazonian landscape.

In the study by Benkendorf and Hawkins (2020), the authors increased the number of hidden layers in the deep neural network to improve the performance of the model, which can be interpreted as adding more training recordings in their software. However, this is not a data augmentation technique but rather a way to increase the model's capacity.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.


I don't know. The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling being applied in the deep learning pipeline.
