Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline used in the ecological study referred to primarily employs aerial image data. The study's primary focus is on semantic segmentation for vegetation mapping, which requires the use of image data.

The workflow (Figure 1) begins with the selection of a deep learning model, followed by the development of a ground-truth imagery dataset. This suggests that the ground-truth data, used for training the model, consists of annotated aerial images.

The deep learning models are then trained using this image data. The scripts and the 2012 aerial imagery used in the study are available at a specified Git repository, further confirming the use of image data in the pipeline.

The acknowledgments section also references other studies that use deep learning techniques with image data, such as Hodgson et al. (2018) and Ventura et al. (2018), which strengthens the conclusion that image data is the primary format used in this deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline in this ecological study is aerial image data. The context does not provide information about the use of other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV files in this specific pipeline.
