Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses feature selection methods such as NDSI, DFM, and LU variables, and the use of machine learning algorithms. However, it does not mention any data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling.

Data augmentation techniques are often used in deep learning to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset, and improve the model's ability to generalize. Common data augmentation techniques include:

* Flipping: Horizontal or vertical flipping of images to increase the number of training examples and improve the model's ability to recognize features regardless of their orientation.
* Rotating: Rotating images by a certain angle to simulate different viewpoints and improve the model's ability to recognize features in different orientations.
* Scaling: Changing the size of images to simulate different distances and improve the model's ability to recognize features at different scales.

Without more information from the context, it is not possible to provide a specific answer about the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
