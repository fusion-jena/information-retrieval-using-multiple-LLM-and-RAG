Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The text mainly focuses on the validation of the model's fitness using various statistical measures after the model has been trained.

However, it can be inferred that the model's performance was evaluated using several fit indices such as Ï‡2/df, GFI, RMSEA, RMR, CFI, NFI, TLI, and IFI. These indices assess the model's goodness of fit, comparative fit, and overall performance. Therefore, it can be assumed that the training process included monitoring these indices to ensure the model's performance was satisfactory.

Moreover, the Cronbach's alpha value of 0.737 indicates a good internal consistency of the model, and the KMO value of 0.645 suggests an acceptable sampling adequacy. These values also imply that the model's training process was carried out effectively.

In summary, while the text does not explicitly mention the strategy used to monitor the model performance during training, it can be inferred that the training process included monitoring the model's fitness using various fit indices, and the model's performance was validated using Cronbach's alpha and KMO values.
