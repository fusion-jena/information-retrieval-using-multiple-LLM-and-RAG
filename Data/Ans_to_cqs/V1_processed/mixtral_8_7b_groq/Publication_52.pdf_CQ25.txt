The deep learning model in question is designed for the purpose of object recognition and classification. Specifically, it is used for the automatic identification and removal of invasive fish species. This is achieved through the implementation of the DELE philosophy, which involves the usage of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for solving complex IT problems. The ELM algorithm is capable of optimizing the choice of input layer weights and bias, which helps in achieving a higher level of generalization.

Moreover, the deep learning model uses an innovative Graph Regularized Extreme Learning Machine Autoencoder (GRELMA) algorithm for clustering. The GRELMA algorithm is based on a multi-layered neural network model that receives successive OL data streams and uses the unsupervised GRELMA algorithm as a basic building block. The outputs of each level are used as inputs to the next one, creating a deep neural network.

The aim of the GRELMA algorithm is to learn a representation (encoding) for a set of data, but with the output layer having the same number of nodes as the input layer. This is done with the purpose of reconstructing its own inputs, instead of predicting target value Y given inputs X. This makes the model suitable for object recognition and classification tasks, where the goal is to identify and categorize objects present in the input data.

In summary, the deep learning model discussed in the provided context is designed for the purpose of object recognition and classification, specifically for the automatic identification and removal of invasive fish species. The model uses an innovative GRELMA algorithm for clustering, which is based on a multi-layered neural network and is capable of learning an efficient representation of the input data for the purpose of reconstructing its own inputs.
