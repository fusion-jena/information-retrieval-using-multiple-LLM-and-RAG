The provided context does not directly discuss the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some data preprocessing steps that were taken in the study.

In the study, gaping data were recorded at 1 Hz and then averaged (mean) over 5 minutes in the Venice Lagoon and over 1 minute in the Wadden Sea. This difference in averaging time was due to different lengths of deployment periods. Using 1-minute averages would make the Venice files too large to easily process, while in the Wadden Sea this higher frequency was technically feasible. Daily curves of gaping for each sensor were then used as input in the analysis, yielding 1286 daily curves for the Venice Lagoon and 203 daily curves for the Wadden Sea.

Additionally, the study used k-means clustering of average daily gaping and rescaled environmental variables, such as temperature, saturation, torbidity, and chlorophyll-a. The k-means clustering was used to identify patterns in the data and to group similar data points together.

However, these preprocessing steps do not directly address data bias. To address data bias, techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection can be used.

Stratified splitting is a method of splitting data into training and testing sets, where the splits are made in such a way that the distribution of labels is similar in both sets. This can help to ensure that the model is trained and tested on a representative sample of the data.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to balance classes in imbalanced datasets. Oversampling involves creating more instances of the minority class, while undersampling involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class.

Diverse data collection is a technique used to ensure that the data used to train the model is representative of the population the model will be used on. This can involve collecting data from a variety of sources, including different geographic locations, demographic groups, and time periods.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not directly discuss techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, it does mention some data preprocessing steps that were taken in the study. To address data bias, techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection can be used.
