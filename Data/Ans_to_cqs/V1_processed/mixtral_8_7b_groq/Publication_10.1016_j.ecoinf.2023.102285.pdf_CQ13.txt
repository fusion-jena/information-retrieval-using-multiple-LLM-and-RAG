The provided context does not give specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model for classifying man-made underwater objects. The paper by Abu and Diamant (2022) focuses on the feature set for classification and does not delve into the specifics of the deep learning model's hyperparameters.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to tune hyperparameters such as learning rate, optimizer, batch size, number of layers, and number of neurons per layer to achieve the best performance. The choice of these hyperparameters can significantly impact the model's accuracy, convergence, and training time.

In general, the learning rate controls the step size during gradient descent, and a suitable learning rate can help the model converge faster and avoid getting stuck in local minima. Common optimizers include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop, each with its advantages and trade-offs. The batch size determines the number of samples processed before updating the model's weights, and a larger batch size can lead to faster training but may result in worse generalization. The number of layers and neurons per layer determines the model's capacity and complexity, and a suitable architecture can help balance the bias-variance trade-off.

Therefore, while the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model for classifying man-made underwater objects are not provided in the context, it is essential to consider tuning these hyperparameters for optimal performance.
