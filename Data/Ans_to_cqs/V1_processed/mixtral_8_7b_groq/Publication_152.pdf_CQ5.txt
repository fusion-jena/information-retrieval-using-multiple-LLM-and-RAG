The provided context does not give specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for the project of identifying Hedychium Coronarium, an invasive vegetation species for the Brazilian natural flora. However, it is mentioned that images were collected using a DJI Phantom 2 drone for training the U-Net model. Data augmentation was used to improve the F1 score.

In general, the choice of dataset depends on the specific problem and the type of data available. Some commonly used datasets in deep learning include MNIST for handwritten digit recognition, CIFAR for object recognition in images, and ImageNet for large-scale image classification. These datasets are widely used for benchmarking and comparing the performance of different deep learning models.

In the context of identifying vegetation species, researchers may use their own collected image datasets or publicly available datasets. For example, the Oxford Flower Dataset is a popular dataset for flower species recognition, which contains 102 flower categories with around 80 images per category. The PlantCLEF dataset is another example, which is a benchmark for plant identification and contains images of various plant species.

Therefore, while the specific dataset used in the project is not mentioned, it is likely that the researchers used their own collected image dataset of Hedychium Coronarium for training the U-Net model.
