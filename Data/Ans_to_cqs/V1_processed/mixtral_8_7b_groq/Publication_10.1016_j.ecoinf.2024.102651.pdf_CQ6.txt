The provided context does not include specific details about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention that the models are used for classifying "microorganisms" and "Cervidae" objects, which implies that some form of image preprocessing is likely being done.

In computer vision tasks such as image classification, common preprocessing steps include:

1. Image Resizing: This is done to ensure that all images have the same dimensions before being fed into the model. This is important because neural networks require fixed-size inputs.

2. Image Normalization: This involves scaling the pixel values of the image to a range between 0 and 1. This is done by dividing each pixel value by 255 (since RGB images have pixel values ranging from 0-255). Normalization can help improve the model's training time and performance.

3. Data Augmentation: This is a technique used to increase the amount of training data by applying random transformations to the images, such as rotation, translation, zooming, and flipping. This helps improve the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

4. Data Cleaning: This involves removing any irrelevant or corrupted images from the dataset.

5. Noise Removal: This is done to remove any unwanted noise from the images that might affect the model's performance.

Based on the context provided, it can be inferred that the authors have preprocessed their image data before training their deep learning models. However, the specific preprocessing steps taken are not mentioned.
