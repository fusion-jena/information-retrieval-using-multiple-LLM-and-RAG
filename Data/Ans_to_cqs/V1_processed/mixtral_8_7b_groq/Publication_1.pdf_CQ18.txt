The text provided does not give specific details about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention that the models are usually trained using stochastic gradient descent, which is a type of optimization algorithm used to minimize some function by iteratively moving in the direction of steepest descent as defined by the negative of the gradient.

In addition, it is mentioned that the models are trained in a supervised fashion, which means that the learning algorithm is told what the desired output is for each input data sample. This setup allows for the calculation of a loss function, which measures the difference between the predicted output and the actual output. The loss function can be used to monitor the model performance during training.

Moreover, the text highlights the use of deep learning models for detecting and classifying events of interest in wildlife data. Deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), have been shown to be very effective in various tasks, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and time series prediction. These models typically have many layers, which allow them to learn complex representations from the data. During training, the performance of these models can be monitored by tracking the evolution of the loss function and other metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Finally, it is worth noting that the text mentions the use of existing DL models to automatically classify and detect species or events of interest in survey data. In this context, the model performance can be monitored by evaluating the quality of the output, for example, by comparing it with manual annotations or expert labels. This evaluation can be done using various metrics, such as those mentioned above, and can provide valuable insights into the model's strengths and weaknesses.
