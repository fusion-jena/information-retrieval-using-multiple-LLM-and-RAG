In the context provided, there are no specific details about training a deep learning model and its preprocessing steps. However, based on general practices in machine learning and data science, there are several common preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. These steps include:

1. Data cleaning: This involves removing any irrelevant, missing, or inconsistent data from the dataset. For example, if there are missing values in the dataset, they can be imputed using various techniques such as mean or median imputation, or removed entirely if they are not significant.
2. Data scaling: This involves scaling the data to a similar range to prevent any features from having a disproportionate influence on the model. Common scaling techniques include standardization (subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation) and normalization (scaling the data between 0 and 1).
3. Data transformation: This involves transforming the data to better suit the model. For example, if the data is highly skewed, it can be transformed using a logarithmic or square root transformation to reduce the skewness.
4. Feature extraction: This involves extracting relevant features from the data that can be used to train the model. In the context provided, the authors used natural log transformations of the number (Nt) of rabbits for feature extraction.
5. Time series analysis: If the data is a time series, it may be necessary to perform time series analysis techniques such as dynamic time warping (DTW) to align the data before training the model.

In summary, while there are no specific details about the preprocessing steps involved in training a deep learning model in the provided context, common preprocessing steps include data cleaning, scaling, transformation, feature extraction, and time series analysis.
