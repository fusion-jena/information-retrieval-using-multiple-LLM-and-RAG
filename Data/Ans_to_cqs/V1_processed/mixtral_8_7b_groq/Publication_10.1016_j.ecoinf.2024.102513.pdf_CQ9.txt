The provided context does not explicitly mention where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. There is no direct reference to data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF in relation to this study. Therefore, I cannot definitively answer this question without additional information. It is possible that the data repository is included in the full research paper or associated materials, but those are not provided in the context.
