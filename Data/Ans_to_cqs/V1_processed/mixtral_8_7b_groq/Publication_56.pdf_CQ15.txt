The provided context does not give specific examples of deep learning optimization techniques used in remote sensing and agricultural applications. However, it is mentioned that deep learning is used in these applications, and optimization techniques are a crucial part of deep learning.

Common optimization techniques used in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a simple optimization algorithm used to minimize some function by iteratively moving in the direction of steepest descent as defined by the negative of the gradient. In deep learning, SGD is used to update the parameters of the model based on the gradient of the loss function.

Adam is a more sophisticated optimization algorithm that combines the ideas of momentum and adaptive learning rates. It is an extension of the RMSprop algorithm and is widely used in deep learning due to its efficiency and ease of implementation.

RMSprop is an optimization algorithm that adapts the learning rate for each parameter of the model based on the recent history of the gradients. It is similar to Adagrad but with a decay factor for the moving average.

These optimization techniques are used to train deep learning models by minimizing the loss function, which measures the difference between the predicted and actual values. The optimization algorithm updates the model parameters based on the gradient of the loss function, and the learning rate determines the step size of the update.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific examples of optimization techniques used in remote sensing and agricultural applications, common optimization techniques used in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop. These optimization techniques are used to train deep learning models by minimizing the loss function and updating the model parameters based on the gradient of the loss function.
