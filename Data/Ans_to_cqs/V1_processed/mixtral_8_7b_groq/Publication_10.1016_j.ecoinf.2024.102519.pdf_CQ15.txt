The provided context discusses various optimization techniques used in artificial intelligence and machine learning, such as genetic algorithms (GA), firefly algorithms, artificial neural networks, support vector machines (SVM), and K-means clustering. However, it does not directly mention the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.

Deep learning pipelines typically use optimization algorithms to minimize the loss function and update the model parameters during training. Some commonly used optimization algorithms in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Momentum, Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSprop, and Adam.

SGD is a simple optimization algorithm that updates the model parameters by computing the gradient of the loss function for a single training example or a mini-batch of training examples. Momentum is an extension of SGD that incorporates the past gradients' direction to accelerate learning and dampen oscillations.

Adagrad, Adadelta, and RMSprop are adaptive learning rate algorithms that adjust the learning rate for each parameter based on the historical gradient information. These algorithms are useful for handling sparse gradients and non-stationary objectives.

Adam is a popular optimization algorithm that combines the advantages of momentum and adaptive learning rate algorithms. Adam estimates the first and second moments of the gradient and uses them to adapt the learning rate for each parameter.

The provided context discusses the use of GA for identifying ecological source areas (ESA) and optimizing the accuracy, connectivity, and clarity of ecological corridors. However, GA is not commonly used in deep learning pipelines due to its high computational cost and slower convergence compared to the optimization algorithms mentioned above.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the optimization techniques commonly applied in the deep learning pipeline include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Momentum, Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSprop, and Adam.
