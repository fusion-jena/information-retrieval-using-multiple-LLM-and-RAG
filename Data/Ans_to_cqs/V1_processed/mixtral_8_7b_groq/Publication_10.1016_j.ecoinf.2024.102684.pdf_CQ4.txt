The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include rotation, horizontal flip, vertical flip, width shift range, height shift range, shear range, zoom range, and brightness range. These techniques were used to increase the number and variability of the training data by modifying the original images. This approach helps prevent overfitting and improves the model's ability to generalize from the training data to new, unseen data. Data augmentation was only applied to the training data to avoid overlapping the same data in different partitions, ensuring an unbiased estimation of error during model evaluation and hyperparameter search.
