The provided context does not give information about the deep learning pipeline or regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. The text focuses on a method for generating redescriptions, which are used to identify new ecoregions based on dental and climate variables. The method involves setting thresholds on the size of the support of the output redescriptions and controlling the length and complexity of their queries. Regularization methods are not mentioned as a part of this process. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer regarding the use of dropout, L2 regularization, or other regularization methods in the described pipeline.
