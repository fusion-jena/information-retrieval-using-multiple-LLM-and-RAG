The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is specified by the use of convolutional layers in the description of both the autoencoder based on explicit max-pooling and the autoencoder based on implicit pooling. Convolutional layers are a key component of CNNs, and are used to extract features from input data. In this case, the input data is a 128x128x3 spectrogram, and the convolutional layers are used to extract features from this data. The use of max-pooling layers in the explicit pooling model and the use of unpooling layers in the implicit pooling model are also indicative of a CNN architecture. These layers are used to downsample and upsample the feature maps produced by the convolutional layers, respectively. This allows the model to learn spatial hierarchies of features in the input data. Overall, the use of convolutional, max-pooling, and unpooling layers in the described pipeline indicates that a CNN is being used.
