Precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP) are the performance metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model, specifically for object detection tasks.

Precision, often denoted as "P," measures the proportion of true positive predictions (relevant instances that the model correctly identified) among all positive predictions made by the model. It is calculated as the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false positives.

Recall, also known as "sensitivity" or "recall rate," measures the ability of a model to identify all relevant instances of a particular class. It is calculated as the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives.

Mean average precision (mAP) is a comprehensive measure for object detection algorithms. It calculates the area under the precision-recall curve (AP) for each class and then averages the results across all classes. The mAP score is often computed at different intersection over union (IoU) thresholds, such as mAP50 (at a 50% IoU threshold) or mAP50-95 (averaging the AP scores at IoU thresholds from 50% to 95%).

In the provided context, the YOLOv8 model demonstrates a noteworthy mAP50 score of 0.995, indicating a high level of accuracy in terms of average precision when considering a 50% IoU threshold. The mYOLOv8 model also achieves a slightly reduced but still outstanding level of performance with an mAP score of 0.899 (IoU 50-95%).

For other models mentioned in the context, accuracy is used as a performance metric. For instance, the YOLO model achieves 94% accuracy in fish detection, and the J48 and CNN models achieve 58.2% and 67.08% accuracy, respectively.

In summary, precision, recall, and mAP are the primary performance metrics for object detection tasks, while accuracy is commonly used for classification tasks.
