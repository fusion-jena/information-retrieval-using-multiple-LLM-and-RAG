The provided context discusses the methodology of a specific study, which includes the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Gradient Boosting for predicting carbon stocks. However, it does not explicitly mention any optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam.

In the context, the ANN used is a Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN), which employs a backpropagation algorithm for training. Backpropagation is a supervised learning method that uses gradient descent to adjust the weights of the network. The context also mentions that hyperparameters were tuned using a grid search method, but it does not specify which optimization techniques were used for this process.

Gradient Boosting, another method used in the study, is an ensemble technique that builds new models to predict the residual errors of previous models. It iteratively adjusts the weights of the training datasets to minimize the error. However, the context does not mention any specific optimization techniques used in this process.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline of this study.
