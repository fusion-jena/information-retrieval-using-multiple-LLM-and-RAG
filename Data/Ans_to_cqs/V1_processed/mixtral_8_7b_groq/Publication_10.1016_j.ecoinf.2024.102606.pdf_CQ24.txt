The provided context does not directly mention any strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does discuss the training protocols used for the deep learning models, which can provide some insight into potential strategies for managing randomness.

The training protocols describe the use of two versions of Faster R-CNN, both of which use Resnet50 as a backbone and are pre-trained on ImageNet. These models were trained with input dimensions of 640 × 640 and 1280 × 1280. The 1280 version was ultimately chosen for the benchmark, but no specific reason is given for why the 640 version had inconclusive results.

One possible strategy for handling randomness in deep learning models is the use of a fixed random seed value. This ensures that the same initial weights are used for each training run, which can help to ensure that any differences in performance between runs are due to changes in the data or model architecture, rather than random variations in the initial weights.

Another potential strategy is data augmentation, which involves creating additional training examples by applying random transformations to the existing data. This can help to improve the model's ability to generalize to new data, as well as providing a way to increase the size of the training set without collecting additional data.

In the context of the provided text, data augmentation could potentially be used to help the 640 version of Faster R-CNN perform better. By applying random transformations to the input images, the model may be able to learn to recognize important features at different scales and orientations, which could help to improve its performance.

Overall, while the provided context does not directly mention any strategies for handling randomness in deep learning models, the use of fixed random seed values and data augmentation are both common techniques that could potentially be employed in this context.
