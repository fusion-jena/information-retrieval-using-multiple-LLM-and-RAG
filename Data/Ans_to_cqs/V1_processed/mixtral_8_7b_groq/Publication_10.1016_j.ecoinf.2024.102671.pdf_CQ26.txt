The provided context does not directly discuss data bias techniques in the preprocessing of deep learning pipelines. However, it does mention some data preprocessing techniques in the context of ecological risk assessment and modeling. I will provide a brief overview of those techniques and then discuss some common data bias techniques used in machine learning and deep learning.

In the context of ecological risk assessment, the following data preprocessing techniques are mentioned:

1. Zonation: A prioritization method that divides the study area into zones based on the presence of specific features or values. It calculates the probability of a feature occurring within a zone and assigns a score accordingly (Ibáñez et al., 2016).
2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA): A dimensionality reduction technique that transforms the original dataset into a new set of variables called principal components. These components capture the maximum variance in the data, allowing for easier analysis (Lever et al., 2017).

In machine learning and deep learning, data bias techniques aim to address issues like class imbalance, underrepresentation, and overrepresentation of specific features in the dataset. Some common data bias techniques include:

1. Stratified splitting: A method for splitting the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets while preserving the original class distribution. This ensures that each subset has a similar proportion of samples from each class (Sechidis et al., 2011).
2. Oversampling: A technique that increases the number of samples from the minority class to balance the dataset. This can be done by duplicating existing samples or generating synthetic samples using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) (Chawla et al., 2002).
3. Undersampling: A technique that reduces the number of samples from the majority class to balance the dataset. This can be done randomly or by using informed methods like Tomek links or Edited Nearest Neighbors (ENN) (Tomek, 1976; Wilson, 1972).
4. Diverse data collection: A method that focuses on collecting data from various sources, ensuring that the dataset is representative of the target population. This can help reduce data bias by capturing a wide range of variations and patterns in the data (Chen et al., 2004).

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss data bias techniques in deep learning preprocessing, it does mention some data preprocessing techniques used in ecological risk assessment. Additionally, I provided an overview of common data bias techniques used in machine learning and deep learning, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.
