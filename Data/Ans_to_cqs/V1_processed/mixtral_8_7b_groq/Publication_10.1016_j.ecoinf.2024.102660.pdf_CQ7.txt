The data for deep learning model training was split based on certain criteria to ensure the model's performance and accuracy. The original dataset consisted of 1764 image pairs, which were reduced to 256 Ã— 256 pixels after cropping. These image pairs were then divided into three sets: training, validation, and testing.

During the training phase, 1232 image pairs were used to train the deep neural network. The model's accuracy was validated using 176 image pairs, which were set aside as the validation set. Finally, the performance of the trained network was tested using 356 image pairs, which formed the test set post-training.

This data split strategy is commonly used in machine learning to ensure that the model is not overfitting the training data and can generalize well to unseen data. By using a separate validation set, the model's performance can be monitored during the training phase, and adjustments can be made to prevent overfitting. The test set is then used to evaluate the final performance of the trained model.

In summary, the data for deep learning model training was split based on the criteria of training, validation, and testing. This strategy involved using 1232 image pairs for training, 176 image pairs for validation, and 356 image pairs for testing the model's performance. This approach helps ensure that the model can generalize well to unseen data and provides valuable insights into the model's performance.
