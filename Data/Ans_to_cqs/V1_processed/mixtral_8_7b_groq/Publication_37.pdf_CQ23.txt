The generalizability of the deep learning model in the study was ensured through several measures. Firstly, the model was trained and tested on a diverse dataset of 5428 flight calls from 43 different bird species. This dataset size and variety helped to reduce overfitting and increased the model's ability to generalize well to unseen data.

Secondly, the study employed 5-fold cross-validation to evaluate the performance of the models. Cross-validation is a powerful technique for assessing the generalizability of machine learning models. It involves dividing the dataset into k-folds, where k is typically 5 or 10. The model is then trained on k-1 folds and tested on the remaining fold. This process is repeated k times, with each fold serving as the test set once. The final performance is reported as the average performance across all k folds. This technique helps to reduce the variance of the model's performance estimate and provides a more reliable estimate of the model's generalizability.

Additionally, the study used data augmentation to increase the diversity of the training data. Data augmentation involves creating new synthetic samples by applying various transformations to the existing data. In this study, the authors applied time stretching and pitch shifting to the original flight calls to create new synthetic samples. This technique helped to increase the size of the training set, reduce overfitting, and improve the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

Finally, the study used a validation set to identify the best training epoch for the CNN model. One of the four training folds was used as a validation set, and the model was trained on the remaining three folds. This technique helped to prevent overfitting and ensured that the model's performance was not artificially inflated by training for too many epochs.

In summary, the study ensured the generalizability of the deep learning model by using a diverse dataset, employing 5-fold cross-validation, using data augmentation, and identifying the best training epoch using a validation set. These techniques helped to reduce overfitting, increase the model's ability to generalize to new data, and provide a more reliable estimate of the model's performance.
