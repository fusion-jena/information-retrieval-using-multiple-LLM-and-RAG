Based on the provided context, the deep learning model in question is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed for image classification. This is evident from the types of layers used in the model, such as convolution, max pool, batch norm, LRN, and fully connected layers, which are commonly used for image classification tasks.

Moreover, the output sizes of the model indicate that it is designed to reduce the spatial dimensions of the input image while increasing the depth of the feature maps, which is a common approach in image classification CNNs. The model starts with an input size of 112x112x3 (RGB image) and reduces the spatial dimensions to 1x1 while increasing the depth to 10000, which is the number of classes in the classification task.

Additionally, the model's architecture is similar to the GoogLeNet model proposed in the paper "Going deeper with convolutions" [31], which won the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) in 2014. The GoogLeNet model introduced the Inception module, which is a building block of the model, and is designed to increase the depth of the network while keeping the computational cost low.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model is image classification.
