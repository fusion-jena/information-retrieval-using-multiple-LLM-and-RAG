The provided context does not contain information about deep learning pipelines and the strategies employed to handle randomness, such as the use of a random seed value. The text focuses on the application of machine learning techniques, specifically random forest and maximum entropy modeling, to predict the occurrence of pine wilt disease in South Korea.

However, in general, deep learning pipelines may employ various strategies to handle randomness. One common method is setting a random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results. By fixing the seed value, the random initialization of weights in the neural network will be the same across multiple runs, leading to consistent outcomes. Other strategies may include techniques like dropout, which randomly sets a fraction of input units to zero during training, helping to prevent overfitting and improving the model's ability to generalize. Additionally, techniques like batch normalization, which standardizes and normalizes the inputs of each batch, can also help reduce the impact of randomness in the pipeline.

In summary, while the provided context does not offer specific information about handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, general strategies include setting a random seed value, dropout, and batch normalization.
