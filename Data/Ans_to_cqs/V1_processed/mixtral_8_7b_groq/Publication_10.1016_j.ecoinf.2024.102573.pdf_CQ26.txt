The provided context discusses various techniques and methods used in the preprocessing of audio data for deep learning, particularly in the context of speech and species recognition. However, it does not directly mention the strategies for addressing data bias during preprocessing such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection. Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.

Nonetheless, I can discuss some of the techniques mentioned in the context that could indirectly help in reducing data bias:

1. Learnable frontends: The provided context explains how learnable frontends like LEAF and SincNet-P are used to increase the flexibility of the audio processing pipeline. These frontends can adapt to the dataset's characteristics by learning the pooling and compression layers. By doing so, they might help in reducing data bias by better capturing the unique features of different data subsets.
2. Gaussian pooling and low-pass filtering: Gaussian pooling and low-pass filtering techniques are used in learnable frontends for downsampling and feature extraction. These methods can help in preserving important information from the raw audio data, which might be useful in reducing data bias by ensuring that each data subset is adequately represented.
3. Log compression: Log compression is applied to the outputs of the frontends to better capture the dynamic range of audio signals. This technique can help in reducing data bias by ensuring that the model can learn from both low-intensity and high-intensity sounds.
4. PCEN (Per-channel Energy Normalization): PCEN is used for both compression and normalization of the audio data. It whitens the data by Gaussianizing the magnitudes and decorrelating the frequency bands. This technique can help in reducing data bias by ensuring that the model can learn from stationary background noise and different frequency bands.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly mention the techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing, it does discuss methods that can help in reducing data bias indirectly. These include learnable frontends, Gaussian pooling, log compression, and PCEN. However, to directly address data bias, techniques such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and Diverse data collection should be considered.
