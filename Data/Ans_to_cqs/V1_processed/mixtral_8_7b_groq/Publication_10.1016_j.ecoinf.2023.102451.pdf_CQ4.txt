Based on the information provided, while the specific data augmentation techniques used in the EMViT-Net deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned, we can infer that some common data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, and scaling were likely employed. This is because the text mentions that data augmentation was performed to address the diversity of training data and data imbalance problems in classification tasks. These issues are commonly addressed through transformations such as flipping (horizontally or vertically), rotation (by a certain degree), and scaling (changing the size of the image). Furthermore, the improvement in the performance of CNN models after augmentation suggests that the augmentation techniques used were effective in increasing the diversity of the training data and reducing the impact of data imbalance. However, the specific augmentation techniques used are not provided in the context, so we cannot give a definitive answer on this matter.
