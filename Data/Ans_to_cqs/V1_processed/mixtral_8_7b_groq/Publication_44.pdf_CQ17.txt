The context provided does not specifically mention the use of dropout or L2 regularization as methods to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does describe other techniques used to reduce overfitting and improve the generalization of the model.

In the context, data augmentation is used as a regularization technique to increase the amount of training data and reduce overfitting. Specifically, data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, and height and width shift are applied to the training images. This helps the model to generalize better as it is exposed to a variety of leaves that can be in different orientations, sizes, and locations.

Another technique used to prevent overfitting is transfer learning. In this approach, a pre-trained VGG16 network is adapted for the new task. By using a pre-trained network, the model can benefit from the knowledge gained from the large-scale ImageNet dataset, which helps to reduce overfitting and improve the performance of the model.

In addition, the context describes the use of an extra max-pooling layer before the fully connected layers to reduce the dimension of the previous layer. This technique can help to reduce overfitting by reducing the complexity of the model and preventing it from memorizing the training data.

Furthermore, the feature vector of the fully connected layer is reduced from 2048 units of the original VGG16 to 128 units, which helps in reducing the computational complexity without sacrificing much on performance. This reduction in the number of parameters can also help to prevent overfitting.

Overall, while the context does not explicitly mention dropout or L2 regularization, it does describe other techniques used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. These techniques include data augmentation, transfer learning, max-pooling, and reducing the complexity of the model.
