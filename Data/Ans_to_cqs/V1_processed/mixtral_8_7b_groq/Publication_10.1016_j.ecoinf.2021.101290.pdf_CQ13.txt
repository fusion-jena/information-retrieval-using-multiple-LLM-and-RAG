The specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model can vary depending on the particular model and the problem it is designed to solve. However, some common hyperparameters include the learning rate, the type of optimizer, the number of layers and nodes in the network, and the activation function used in each node.

The learning rate determines how much the model's weights are adjusted during training with each new piece of data. A learning rate that is too high may cause the model to converge too quickly to a suboptimal solution, while a learning rate that is too low may cause the training process to progress too slowly.

The optimizer is the algorithm used to update the model's weights during training. Common optimizers include stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop. These optimizers use different strategies to update the weights, such as using the gradient of the loss function or the moving average of the gradients.

The number of layers and nodes in the network determines the complexity of the model. A model with more layers and nodes can learn more complex patterns in the data, but it also requires more data and computational resources to train.

The activation function determines the output of each node in the network. Common activation functions include the rectified linear unit (ReLU), sigmoid, and tanh. These functions introduce non-linearity into the model, allowing it to learn more complex relationships between the inputs and outputs.

In the paper "Deep Learning with Theano, Torch, Caffe, Tensorflow, and deeplearning4j: Which One Is the Best in Speed and Accuracy?" by Kovalev, V., Kalinovsky, A., and Kovalev, S. (2016), the authors compare the performance of different deep learning frameworks, but they do not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in their models.

In the paper "Cormorant audiograms under water and in air" by Larsen, O., Christensen-Dalsgaard, J., Maxwell, A., Hansen, K., and Wahlberg, M. (2017), the authors use a deep learning model to classify bird calls, but they do not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in their model.

In the paper "Deep learning" by LeCun, Y., Bengio, Y., and Hinton, G. (2015), the authors provide a general overview of deep learning, but they do not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in their models.

Therefore, while there are common hyperparameters used in deep learning models, the specific values of these hyperparameters can vary depending on the problem and the model. It is important to carefully tune these hyperparameters to achieve the best performance on a given task.
