The criteria used to determine when training is complete in this particular context is not explicitly stated. However, we can infer that the training might have been determined to be complete based on the performance of the model on the validation data, as indicated by the scores precision, recall, F1, GIoU, and mAP. Specifically, the model quickly reached F1 and mAP scores of ~0.4 and continued to increase, but at a slower rate. At the end of the training, the model achieved the accuracy scores of F1 = 0.530 and mAP = 0.557. Additionally, the GIoU is steadily decreasing, indicating that the model is becoming better at correctly locating targets.

It's also worth noting that the training was run for a fixed number of epochs, 350, and the batch size was set to 4 due to limitations in computer memory. The learning rate was set to 0.001 based on previous studies that have succeeded with this value for similar tasks.

In summary, while the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete is not explicitly stated, it appears that the training was determined to be complete based on the performance of the model on the validation data, as well as reaching a predetermined number of epochs.
