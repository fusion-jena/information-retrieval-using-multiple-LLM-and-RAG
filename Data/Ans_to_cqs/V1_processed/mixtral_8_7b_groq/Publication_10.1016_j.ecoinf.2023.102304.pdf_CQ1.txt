The provided pieces of context do not directly discuss the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, they do mention various data sources and indices that can be used in remote sensing and geospatial analysis.

Remote sensing is a common method for collecting large-scale geospatial data, which often involves the use of sensors on satellites or aircraft. For example, the studies mentioned use data from Landsat satellites, which have spectral bands that can be used to analyze various features of the Earth's surface. These spectral bands can be used to calculate vegetation indices such as NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index), and NBR (Normalized Burn Ratio), among others.

Public datasets are another important source of raw data for deep learning pipelines. The studies mentioned use data from the Google Earth Engine, which provides access to a wide range of public satellite imagery and geospatial datasets. These datasets can be used to analyze various features of the Earth's surface, such as vegetation cover, land use and land cover changes, and wildfire recovery.

In addition to remote sensing and public datasets, surveys and other ground-based data collection methods can also be used to collect raw data for deep learning pipelines. However, these methods are not mentioned in the provided pieces of context.

Therefore, based on the provided pieces of context, the following methods are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline:

* Remote sensing using sensors on satellites or aircraft
* Public datasets, such as those provided by the Google Earth Engine
