The provided context does not give specific details about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention the importance of cross-validation techniques for assessing the predictive accuracy and robustness of ecological zoning models. Cross-validation is a technique used to assess how well a model will generalize to an independent data set by validating the model on a subset (or subsets) of the training data. This can help to ensure that the model is not overfitting to the training data and is able to accurately predict new, unseen data. Additionally, the context highlights the need to consider the dynamic changes in ecosystem and ecological carbon sink states, which suggests that the model performance may be monitored over time to ensure that it remains accurate as the ecosystem changes.

In the study by Lever, Krzywinski, and Altman (2017), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the dimensionality of the data and visualize the relationships between variables. PCA is an unsupervised learning algorithm, which means that it does not require a training set and therefore does not have a training phase where model performance can be monitored.

The study by Li, Chen, Liao, Chen, and Zhou (2018) used remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) technology for ecological risk assessment. They used a model to assess the ecological risk, but the context does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training.

The study by Li, Y.N., Duo, L.H., Zhang, M., Yang, J.Y., and Guo, X.F. (2022) used the InVEST model for habitat quality assessment. However, the context does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training.

In summary, while the provided context highlights the importance of cross-validation and monitoring model performance over time, it does not give specific details about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training.
