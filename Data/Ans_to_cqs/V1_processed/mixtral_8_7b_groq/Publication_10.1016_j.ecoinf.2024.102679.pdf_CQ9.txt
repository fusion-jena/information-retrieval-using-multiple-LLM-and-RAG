Based on the provided context, there is no clear information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the aerial surveys for wildlife conservation. The articles and abstracts mentioned do not specify where the data or code for the deep learning pipeline is publicly available or stored. It is possible that the data and code are not publicly available due to privacy concerns or other restrictions.

However, it is common practice in scientific research to make data and code publicly available to promote transparency and reproducibility. Therefore, it is possible that the data and code for the deep learning pipeline used in the aerial surveys for wildlife conservation will be made available in the future.

If you are interested in accessing the data or code, I would recommend contacting the authors of the articles or the organizations involved in the research, such as the Oxford Conservation Research Programme or the University of Twente. They may be able to provide more information about the availability of the data and code.

In summary, based on the provided context, there is no clear information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the aerial surveys for wildlife conservation. However, it is possible that the data and code will be made available in the future, and contacting the authors or organizations involved in the research may provide more information.
