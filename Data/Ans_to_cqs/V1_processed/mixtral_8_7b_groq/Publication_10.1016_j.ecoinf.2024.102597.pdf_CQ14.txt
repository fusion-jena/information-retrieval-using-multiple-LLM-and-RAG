The hyperparameters of the models used for estimating the water Chla concentration and turbidity in Nansi Lake were optimized using both random grid search and Bayesian optimization methods. The random grid search was implemented using GridSearchCV from Scikit-learn, while the Bayesian optimization was carried out using the Hyperopt library (version 0.2.7).

Before tuning each model, a benchmark model with default parameters was established to evaluate whether parameter adjustments had a beneficial impact on model performance. The best parameters for each model were then selected based on the optimization results, and the performance of the models was compared.

The hyperparameters of the models, including Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost, were optimized using the aforementioned methods. However, it is important to note that the training and hyperparameter optimization times for CatBoost were significantly longer than those of the other models. This may be due to the complex internal feature processing of the model and the fact that a GPU was not used for training.

The performance of RF and GBDT was weaker than that of CatBoost, but XGBoost demonstrated the highest robustness for estimating the water Chla concentration and turbidity in Nansi Lake. The hyperparameters of XGBoost, as well as the other models, were optimized using the random grid search and Bayesian optimization methods.

In addition, the error before and after the correction of the remote sensing reflectivity of each band was analyzed, and the results were presented in Fig. 7(a). The comparison of errors before and after remote sensing reflectance correction in different years was also presented in Fig. 7(b).

Overall, the hyperparameters of the models were optimized using both random grid search and Bayesian optimization methods, and the best parameters for each model were selected based on the optimization results. The performance of the models was then compared, and XGBoost demonstrated the highest robustness for estimating the water Chla concentration and turbidity in Nansi Lake.
