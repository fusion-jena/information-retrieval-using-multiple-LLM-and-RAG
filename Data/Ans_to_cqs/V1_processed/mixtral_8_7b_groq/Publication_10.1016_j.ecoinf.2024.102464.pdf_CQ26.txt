The provided context discusses the use of machine learning models in assessing the impact of urban development on species distribution, but it does not directly mention techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide some general techniques used to address data bias in machine learning and deep learning, which can be applied during the data preprocessing stage.

1. Stratified sampling: Stratified sampling is a method of sampling that involves dividing the population into subgroups or strata, and then selecting a sample from each stratum. This method ensures that each subgroup is proportionally represented in the sample, reducing bias that may arise from uneven distribution of classes.

2. Oversampling: Oversampling is a technique used to increase the number of instances in the minority class, balancing the dataset. This method can help prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.

3. Undersampling: Undersampling is a technique used to decrease the number of instances in the majority class, balancing the dataset. This method can help prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.

4. Diverse data collection: Collecting diverse data is a crucial step in reducing data bias. By collecting data from various sources, the model can learn from a more representative sample of the population, reducing the risk of bias.

5. Data augmentation: Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the size of the dataset by generating new instances from existing ones. This method can help prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly mention techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, there are several general techniques used to address data bias in machine learning and deep learning. These techniques include stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, diverse data collection, and data augmentation.
