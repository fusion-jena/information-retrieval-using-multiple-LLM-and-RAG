Deep learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), can handle various data formats, including images, audio, video, and CSV files, among others. The choice of data format depends on the specific problem and task at hand.

In the context provided, the primary focus is on image classification, specifically underwater benthic species recognition. Therefore, the data format used in this case is images. Researchers have employed neural networks to classify species based on underwater video frames (Beijbom et al., 2012; Marcos et al., 2013). These images are likely preprocessed to standardize their size, format, and quality before being fed into the CNN.

However, deep learning models can also handle other data formats. For instance, audio data can be used in speech recognition, natural language processing, and music information retrieval tasks. In these cases, the raw audio data is transformed into a suitable format, such as spectrograms or Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), which can then be fed into a deep learning model (e.g., CNN, Recurrent Neural Networks, or Transformer models).

Video data can be used in action recognition, object detection, and tracking tasks. Video data is typically preprocessed by extracting frames or features, such as optical flow, and then fed into a deep learning model.

CSV files, which contain tabular data, can be used in regression, classification, and time-series forecasting tasks. In these cases, the CSV data is preprocessed by extracting relevant features and transforming them into a suitable format for the deep learning model.

In summary, deep learning models can handle various data formats, including images, audio, video, and CSV files. The choice of data format depends on the specific problem and task at hand. In the context provided, the primary focus is on image classification, specifically underwater benthic species recognition.
