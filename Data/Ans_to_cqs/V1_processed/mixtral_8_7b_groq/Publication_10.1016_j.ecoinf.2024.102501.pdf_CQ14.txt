The pieces of context provided do not explicitly mention the methods used to optimize the hyperparameters of the models, such as grid search or random search. However, they do mention that search algorithms like the genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are often used to solve model parameter problems. For instance, Yan et al. used GA and PSO to optimize a BP neural network for dissolved oxygen (DO) estimation.

Additionally, the context mentions the Whale-Tuning Differential Search (WTD-SVR) model, which integrates the SVR model with a whale optimization algorithm for predicting DO concentration. The whale optimization algorithm is a nature-inspired optimization technique that can be used to optimize the hyperparameters of models.

Furthermore, the context mentions the use of the bat algorithm to optimize an LSSVM model for predicting DO concentration. The bat algorithm is another nature-inspired optimization technique that can be used for hyperparameter tuning.

Therefore, while the pieces of context do not explicitly mention grid search or random search, they do suggest that nature-inspired optimization algorithms are commonly used to optimize the hyperparameters of models for DO estimation. However, it is important to note that other hyperparameter tuning methods, such as grid search and random search, may also be used in practice.
