The provided context does not include specific information on the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of remote sensing data and hyperspectral/multispectral imagery for land use and land cover classification, which are common applications of deep learning in environmental analysis.

In the context of remote sensing and image processing, some common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing a rectangle around the object of interest in an image. It is a simple and efficient way to label objects in an image, and it is often used for object detection tasks.
2. Instance segmentation: This technique involves labeling each individual instance of an object in an image. It is a more detailed and time-consuming annotation method compared to bounding box annotation, but it allows for more precise object localization and classification.
3. Pixel-wise classification: This technique involves assigning a class label to each individual pixel in an image. It is commonly used for land cover classification and image segmentation tasks.
4. Semantic segmentation: This technique involves assigning a class label to groups of pixels that belong to the same object class. It is similar to pixel-wise classification, but it allows for more complex object shapes and relationships.

These annotation techniques are used to train deep learning models by providing them with labeled data that they can learn from. The models then use this learned information to make predictions on new, unlabeled data.

In summary, while the provided context does not specifically mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it does mention the use of remote sensing data and hyperspectral/multispectral imagery for land use and land cover classification. Common annotation techniques for these applications include bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, pixel-wise classification, and semantic segmentation.
