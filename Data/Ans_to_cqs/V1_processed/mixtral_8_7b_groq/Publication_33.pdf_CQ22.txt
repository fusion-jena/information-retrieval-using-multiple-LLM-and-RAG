The provided context discusses the use of "accuracy" as a metric for evaluating the performance of the deep learning model. Specifically, it mentions that the raw accuracy of the deep learning model is 0.92, and that post-processing of the model outputs can improve the accuracy to an average of 0.92 for goal G3, 0.81 for goal G2, and 0.74 for goal G1.

However, the context does not explicitly mention other metrics such as precision, recall, or F1 score. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions, recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positives, and the F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.

It is important to note that accuracy might not always be the best metric for evaluating the performance of a deep learning model, especially in imbalanced datasets where one class has significantly more samples than the other. In such cases, precision, recall, or F1 score might be more appropriate metrics.

Therefore, while the context provides information on the use of accuracy as a metric for evaluating the deep learning model, it does not explicitly mention other metrics such as precision, recall, or F1 score.
