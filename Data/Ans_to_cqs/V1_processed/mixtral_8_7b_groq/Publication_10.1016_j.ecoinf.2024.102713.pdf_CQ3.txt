Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the data platform and its components, data sources, and processes such as integration, enrichment, validation, and loading. It does not mention any details about the use of data annotation techniques specific to deep learning, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query.
