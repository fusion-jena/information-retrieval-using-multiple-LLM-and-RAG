The context provided does not give specific information on how the hyperparameters of the models were optimized. There is no mention of techniques such as grid search, random search, or any other method for hyperparameter tuning. The text focuses on the selection of the optimal model architecture for each species, based on the soundscape data and the F0.5 score. It also provides details on the performance metrics, such as precision, recall, and F0.5, for different model architectures like MobileNetv2, ResNet50v2, and ResNet101v2. However, the hyperparameter tuning process remains undisclosed in the given context.
