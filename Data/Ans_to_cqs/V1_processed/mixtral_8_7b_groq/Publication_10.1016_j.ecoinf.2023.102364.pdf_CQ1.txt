The article titled "[Article Information]" utilizes a variety of methods to collect raw data for its deep learning pipeline. These methods include surveys, public datasets, and likely sensors as well.

Firstly, the article mentions the use of "multi-year field work" and "survey location data" for Short-billed Gulls (Larus canus) during May and June of 2014 and 2015. This suggests that the authors conducted surveys to collect data on the presence and absence of Short-billed Gulls in specific census blocks. These surveys are referred to as the "model training data" in the article.

Additionally, the authors use U.S. Census data from the year 2000, which is a public dataset. This dataset includes various attributes such as population density, household income, and housing units. The Census data is used in conjunction with other GIS data, such as distance to railway, vegetation name, and soil type. These GIS data are likely obtained from various sources, including the Fairbanks Borough GIS, the Alaska Clearinghouse, and the Alaska US Census portal.

Furthermore, the article mentions the use of "machine learning ensembles" such as RandomForest, Treenet, CART, and MARS. While the article does not explicitly state the source of the data used in these models, it is possible that some of the data comes from sensors. For instance, distance to railway and vegetation name could be obtained from sensors that measure proximity and identify plant species.

Overall, the article utilizes a combination of survey data, public datasets, and likely sensor data to collect raw data for its deep learning pipeline.
