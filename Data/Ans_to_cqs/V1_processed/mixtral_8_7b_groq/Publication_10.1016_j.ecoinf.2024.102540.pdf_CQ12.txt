The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline, as described in the given context, is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is mentioned explicitly when stating that "a CNN is a deep neural network that can be used to process any data with a grid pattern, including imagery data" and that "CNNs perform mathematical operations focusing on convolution operations, which is a linear operation that can extract image features useful for detection and classification tasks." Furthermore, the specific use of CNNs in the context is to process insect images for detection and classification tasks. Therefore, a CNN is the type of deep learning model used in this pipeline.
