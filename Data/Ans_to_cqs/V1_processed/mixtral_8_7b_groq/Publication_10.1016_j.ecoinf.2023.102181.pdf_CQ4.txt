The provided context does not directly discuss data augmentation techniques in the deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. However, it does discuss a method called "covariance-weighted bagging" used in machine learning to minimize bias during model training with clustered data.

Covariance-weighted bagging is a technique that down-weights over-sampled information to reduce bias during model training. This method could potentially improve predictive performance, but it was not explicitly tested in the study. The study suggests simulating a surface from a pre-defined combination of response functions to environmental variables and testing for the capacity to recover the responses using covariance-weighted bagging under various clustering scenarios.

Additionally, the context discusses the importance of using appropriate design-based strategies and developing machine learning solutions for handling clustered data that yield spatially autocorrelated errors.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly answer the query regarding data augmentation techniques in the deep learning pipeline, it does discuss a method for reducing bias during model training with clustered data. Data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in deep learning to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset, improve model generalization, and prevent overfitting.
