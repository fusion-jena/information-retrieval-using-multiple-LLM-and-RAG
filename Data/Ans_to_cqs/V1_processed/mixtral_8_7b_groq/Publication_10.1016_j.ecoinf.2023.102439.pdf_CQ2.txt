The provided context discusses the use of satellite data, specifically from the MODIS-TERRA sensor, in the form of the MOD11A2 product to derive Land Surface Temperature (LST) data. The LST dataset is derived from infrared radiations measured on channels 31 and 32. Additionally, the context also mentions the use of artificial neural network models, such as the NARX model, in the modelling of vegetation biomass density for future scenarios. However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of image, audio, video, or CSV data formats in the deep learning pipeline.

However, it can be inferred that satellite data, such as the MOD11A2 product, is likely provided in a raster format (e.g., GeoTIFF) which can be considered as an image data format. Additionally, the use of artificial neural network models, such as the NARX model, often requires the data to be in a numerical format, such as a CSV file, where each row represents a sample and each column represents a feature.

In summary, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that image (raster) and CSV data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline. However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of audio or video data formats.
