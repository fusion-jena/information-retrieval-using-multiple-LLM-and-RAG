In the deep learning pipeline for wetland mapping, the methods used for collecting raw data typically involve the use of remote sensing technologies, such as those provided by the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites. These sensors collect data in the form of images, which can then be used as input to a deep learning model. In addition to remote sensing data, other sources of data may also be used in the deep learning pipeline. For example, the study mentioned in the context utilized two data sets generated from photo interpretation and one field validation data set. These data sets were likely used to train and validate the deep learning model. It is also possible to use public datasets, such as those provided by Google Earth Engine, as input to a deep learning model for wetland mapping. In summary, the deep learning pipeline for wetland mapping typically involves the use of remote sensing technologies, such as those provided by the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites, as well as other data sources such as photo interpretation, field validation, and public datasets.
