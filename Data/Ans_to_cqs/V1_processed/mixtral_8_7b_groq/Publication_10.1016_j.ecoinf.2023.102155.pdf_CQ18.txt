The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it does mention some techniques and factors that are relevant to evaluating model performance.

Firstly, the context discusses the importance of bias correction in model performance. This implies that monitoring and correcting for bias could be a part of the strategy used to assess the model's performance during training.

Secondly, the context highlights the impact of sample size on model performance. It suggests that increasing the sample size can help balance out data biases and improve a model's accuracy. Therefore, monitoring the sample size and its distribution throughout the training process could be another aspect of the strategy.

Thirdly, the context refers to the use of various methods such as individual method, indivknnkmeans, randomCFLoop, ALoop, TLoop, and E, among others. It is possible that these methods are used to evaluate the model's performance at different stages of training.

Lastly, the context mentions the use of metrics such as meanRSS and hidden observations to assess model performance. These metrics could be used to monitor the model's performance during training.

In summary, while the specific strategy for monitoring model performance during training is not provided, the context suggests that it could involve monitoring and correcting for bias, ensuring an adequate sample size, employing various methods for evaluation, and tracking metrics such as meanRSS and hidden observations.
