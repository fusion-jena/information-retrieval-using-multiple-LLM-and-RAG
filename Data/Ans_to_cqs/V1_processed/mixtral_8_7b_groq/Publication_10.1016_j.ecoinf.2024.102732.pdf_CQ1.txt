The text abstracts and articles provided do not directly answer the query regarding the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, they do mention various sources and types of data used in different studies.

From the context, it can be inferred that remote sensing and field data are used in studies related to machine learning and forest ecosystems. Remote sensing involves the use of satellite or aerial sensors to collect data about the Earth's surface. For instance, the articles mention the use of Landsat data from the USGS Earth Explorer website, ALOS2 data, and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data. These data sources provide information about land cover, vegetation health, and other biophysical parameters, which can be used as input for machine learning models.

Field data, on the other hand, involves direct measurements or observations made in the field. For example, one of the articles mentions the use of flowering data collected in an alpine meadow on the Tibetan plateau. This type of data is typically used to validate or calibrate models developed using remote sensing data.

In addition to remote sensing and field data, public datasets and other data sources may also be used in the deep learning pipeline. For instance, one of the articles mentions the use of a dataset consisting of sales data, which was used to compare the performance of neural networks, lasso regularized logistic regression, and gradient boosted trees.

Overall, while the text does not provide a comprehensive list of methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it does suggest that remote sensing, field data, and public datasets are commonly used in studies related to machine learning and forest ecosystems.
