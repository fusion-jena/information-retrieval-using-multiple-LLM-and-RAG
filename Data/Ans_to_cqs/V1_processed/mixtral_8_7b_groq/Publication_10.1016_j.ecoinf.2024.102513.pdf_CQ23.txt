The text provided offers insights into several measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, even though it does not explicitly mention diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.

Firstly, the authors employed attention mechanisms within the neural network. This mechanism allows the model to dynamically assign significance to different features over time, empowering it to prioritize essential information from available data while effectively managing gaps in historical records. This approach enhances the model's ability to handle new, unseen data, thereby improving its generalizability.

Secondly, the integration of auxiliary data, such as climate or soil characteristics, was used to fortify the neural network's generalization capability. By leveraging insights from these auxiliary datasets, the model can make informed predictions in historical periods with limited direct data. This strategy of using additional relevant data can contribute to the model's ability to generalize well to new data.

The use of a Pooling Layer in the model also aids in improving generalizability. The Pooling Layer performs data downsampling, reducing dimensionality and extracting essential features. This helps reduce the number of parameters and computations, enhances invariance to small shifts and scale changes, and improves the model's generalization ability.

However, the text does not explicitly mention the use of diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Diverse datasets are crucial for ensuring that a model can handle a wide variety of data, and cross-validation and stratified splitting are common techniques used to assess and improve a model's ability to generalize to new data. Despite their absence in the provided text, the measures mentioned still provide a robust foundation for a generalizable deep learning model.
