The provided context discusses several methods for collecting raw data in the context of various studies, including surveys and sensor data.

In the study by Abu and Diamant (2022), raw data is collected using underwater imagery and sonography to detect man-made underwater objects (MMOs) within a limited region of interest (RoI). The authors propose a contour-based features analysis method to discern MMOs from natural objects, assuming that the contours of MMOs are smoother than those of natural objects.

In the study by Han et al. (year not provided), remote optical imagery is used to collect raw data for detecting, classifying, and locating vessels and oil platforms, excluding other MMOs. The authors propose a deep learning (DL) technique titled LCSE-ResNet for this purpose.

In the study by Çalışkan (2023), raw data is collected using 3D posture data to detect human activity types using deep learning models.

In the study by Clements and Robinson (2022), long-term data on winter bird communities in the Oregon coast range, USA, are collected using standardized and well-structured approaches. However, the authors note that such data is not available for most biogeographical regions due to the cost of data processing with intensive human intervention.

In the study by Davis et al. (2022), raw data is collected using aerial surveys to identify pitfalls and solutions for errors in aerial survey count data, particularly in the context of ecology.

In summary, various methods are used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, including underwater imagery and sonography, remote optical imagery, 3D posture data, and aerial surveys. Additionally, public datasets may also be used, although they are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
