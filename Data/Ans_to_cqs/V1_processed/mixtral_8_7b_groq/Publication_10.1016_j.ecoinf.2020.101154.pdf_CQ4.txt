Based on the provided context, there is no information about data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling being applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the use of Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT) for identifying potential drivers of changes in growth across herring populations. It mentions the use of hyperparameter tuning, where the learning rate and number of iterations were adjusted, as well as the splitting of data into training and test datasets. However, it does not mention any data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide information on the use of data augmentation techniques in this specific deep learning pipeline.
