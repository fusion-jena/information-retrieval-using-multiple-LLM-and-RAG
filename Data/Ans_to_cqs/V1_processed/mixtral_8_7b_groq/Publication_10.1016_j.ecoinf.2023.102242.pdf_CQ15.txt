The provided context does not include information about optimization techniques typically used in deep learning pipelines, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. Instead, it focuses on data processing and classification methods used in a different study.

In the study mentioned, the optimization technique applied is a hierarchical structure for selecting the optimal feature combination for classification. This method aims to minimize data redundancy and enhance classification accuracy and efficiency. However, this is not a technique commonly used in deep learning pipelines.

Deep learning pipelines typically use optimization techniques to minimize the loss function and update the model's parameters during training. Some common optimization techniques include:

1. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD): This is a simple optimization algorithm that updates the model's parameters by computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to each parameter.
2. Momentum: This is an optimization technique that helps accelerate SGD in the relevant direction and dampens oscillations in the irrelevant direction.
3. Adagrad: This is an optimization algorithm that adapts the learning rate for each parameter.
4. Adadelta: This is an optimization algorithm that adapts the learning rate based on the past gradient.
5. Adam: This is an optimization algorithm that combines the ideas from Adagrad and momentum.

These optimization techniques are used to train deep learning models and improve their performance. However, the provided context does not mention any of these techniques.
