The criteria used to determine when training is complete in the study mentioned is the early stopping criterion, also known as "patience" in Keras. According to this criterion, if after 50 epochs the validation accuracy does not increase, the training process is halted. This means that the training stops if there is no improvement in the validation accuracy for a certain number of epochs, which is set to 50 in this study. This is a common approach to prevent overfitting and to ensure that the model has learned enough from the training data. The validation accuracy is used as a metric to check for model generalization, and if it does not improve over time, it indicates that the model may not be learning new information that would help it perform better on unseen data.
