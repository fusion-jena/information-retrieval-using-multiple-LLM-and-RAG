Based on the provided context, there is no information about a deep learning pipeline or its data repository. The study discusses the use of satellite-based datasets for drought monitoring in a specific basin, but it does not mention any deep learning pipeline or data repository related to it.

The datasets used in the study include MODIS vegetation and land surface temperature products, CMAP precipitation datasets, and Landsat satellite datasets. The MODIS and CMAP datasets were obtained from the Google Earth Engine platform and NOAA repository, respectively. The Landsat satellite datasets were used to investigate water surface area and salinity variations, and 150 images from 1985 to 2020 were selected for the study.

The methodology involves assessing the potential of remote sensing-based datasets for drought monitoring, calculating mean annual precipitation values using ground- and satellite-based datasets, and mapping the basin in terms of drought and mean entropy. However, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or its data repository.

Therefore, I cannot provide information on the data repository of the deep learning pipeline as it is not mentioned in the given context.
