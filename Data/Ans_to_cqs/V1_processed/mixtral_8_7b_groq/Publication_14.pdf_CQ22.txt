The specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are not explicitly stated in the provided text. However, there are some indications that allow us to make an educated guess.

Firstly, the authors mention "quantitative benchmarks" are needed to validate model performance (Pimm et al., 2015). This suggests that they are interested in objective measures of performance.

Secondly, the authors use the term "classification" when discussing the model's output (Weinstein, 2015; Price Tack et al., 2016). This implies that the model is making categorical predictions, which can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

Accuracy is the proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions made. Precision is the proportion of true positives (correctly predicted instances of a class) among all positive predictions. Recall is the proportion of true positives among all actual instances of a class, regardless of whether they were predicted correctly.

These metrics are often used together to provide a comprehensive evaluation of a classification model's performance. It is likely that the authors used at least one of these metrics, if not a combination, to evaluate their deep learning model.

In addition, the authors mention "candidate motion frames" and "errors in event detection" (Weinstein, 2015; Price Tack et al., 2016). These phrases suggest that they may have also considered false positive and false negative rates when evaluating the model. False positive rate is the proportion of negative instances incorrectly predicted as positive, while false negative rate is the proportion of positive instances incorrectly predicted as negative.

Another possible metric could be the F1 score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It provides a single metric that encapsulates both precision and recall, offering a balanced evaluation of a binary classification model.

In summary, while the specific metrics used to evaluate the deep learning model are not provided, it is likely that the authors used accuracy, precision, recall, or a related metric such as the F1 score. They may have also considered false positive and false negative rates in their evaluation.
