The provided context does not mention which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model, if any. The text discusses the use of various machine learning models, such as Enet, SVM, RF, Xgboost, and LightGBM, for predicting canopy cover from Planet data. It also mentions the use of Python libraries "xgboost" and "lightgbm" for implementing XGboost and LightGBM models. However, there is no information about the deployment of a deep learning model and the platform used for it. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
