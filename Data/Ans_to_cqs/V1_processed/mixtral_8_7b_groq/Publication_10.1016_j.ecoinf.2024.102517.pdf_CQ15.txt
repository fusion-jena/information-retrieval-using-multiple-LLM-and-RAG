In the deep learning pipeline for bird sound noise reduction, the optimization technique used is the Adam optimizer. The Adam optimizer is a method for optimizing stochastic objective functions, which is a type of optimization problem commonly encountered in machine learning. It was introduced in a paper by Kingma and Ba in 2014.

The Adam optimizer is used to train the deep feature loss bird sound noise reduction network model. This model is based on a deep learning environment constructed using Python and Tensorflow, with GPU and CUDA support, under the Windows operating system. The model was trained for 50 epochs on an RTX 2080 Ti GPU. During each epoch, the entire training set was presented in a random order, with one noisy bird sound signal per iteration.

The Adam optimizer was chosen because it has been shown to be effective at training deep learning models. It is an extension of stochastic gradient descent (SGD), which is a simple optimization algorithm that updates the parameters of a model by taking steps in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function. However, SGD can be slow to converge and can be sensitive to the learning rate. The Adam optimizer addresses these issues by using adaptive learning rates for each parameter. It calculates the learning rate for each parameter based on the historical gradient information of that parameter. This allows the optimizer to adjust the learning rate for each parameter dynamically, which can result in faster convergence and better performance.

In summary, the Adam optimizer is used to train the deep feature loss bird sound noise reduction network model. This optimizer is a method for optimizing stochastic objective functions and is an extension of stochastic gradient descent. It was chosen because it has been shown to be effective at training deep learning models and can result in faster convergence and better performance.
