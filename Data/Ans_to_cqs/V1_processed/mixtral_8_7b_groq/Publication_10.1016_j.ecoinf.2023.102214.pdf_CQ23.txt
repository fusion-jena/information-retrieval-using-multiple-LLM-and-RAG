The text provided discusses a deep learning model used for image classification, specifically for identifying snow leopards. However, it does not explicitly mention the methods used to ensure the generalizability of the model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. 

However, it does mention that the study contributes the "largest fully labeled snow leopard dataset for deep learning research" which suggests that efforts were made to create a diverse dataset. The authors also mention that they anticipate their methods will encourage other researchers to contribute more datasets to Whiskerbook.org, implying a desire to continue expanding and diversifying the dataset.

In the context of assessing the model's performance, the authors compute the top-k accuracy on a test set. This suggests that some form of splitting the data into training and testing sets was done, although it's not specified whether this was done randomly, stratified, or in some other way.

In conclusion, while the text provides some implicit evidence that steps were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model, it does not explicitly confirm the use of diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.
