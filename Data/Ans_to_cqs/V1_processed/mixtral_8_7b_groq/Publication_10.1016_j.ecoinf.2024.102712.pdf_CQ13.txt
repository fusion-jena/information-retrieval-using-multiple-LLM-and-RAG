The provided context does not include information about the specific deep learning model, its architecture, or the hyperparameters used such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context focuses on the use and analysis of data related to above-ground biomass density (AGBD) in forests, specifically in Betul and Mudumalai forests, using various data sources including GEDI L4A, Sentinel-2, and other datasets.

The AGBD data is presented in the form of cells with associated uncertainties, and the analysis includes the number of available shots with acceptable uncertainty based on GEDI L4A and L2A beam sensitivity thresholds. The context also includes references to several papers that discuss remote sensing and AGBD estimation methods, but it does not provide specific details about the deep learning model or its hyperparameters.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query regarding the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
