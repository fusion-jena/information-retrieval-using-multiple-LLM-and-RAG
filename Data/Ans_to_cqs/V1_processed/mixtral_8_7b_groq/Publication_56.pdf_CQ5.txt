The pieces of context provided do not mention specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in the deep learning pipelines for remote sensing applications. However, they do provide information on some of the datasets used in remote sensing research.

For instance, Rußwurm and Körner (2017) used Sentinel-2 time series for multi-temporal land cover classification with long short-term memory neural networks. Similarly, Zhu et al. (2017) used high-resolution satellite images from the IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest for processing and analyzing remotely sensed data. Liu et al. (2017) used high-resolution aerial imagery for semantic segmentation using a hourglass-shaped network. Lees et al. (2020) used Landsat-8 surface reflectance data to predict vegetation health using a machine learning pipeline.

It is important to note that the datasets used in remote sensing research may vary depending on the specific application and research question. Remote sensing datasets can include various types of data such as satellite or aerial images, lidar data, and other types of geospatial data. The selection of an appropriate dataset depends on the research question and the specific deep learning model being used.
