Based on the information provided, there is no explicit statement about the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the Stacked Auto-Encoder (SAE) model in the study. However, the paper does present a figure (Fig. 6) that shows the mean error and the number of misclassified points used to estimate the optimal number of iterations for the SAE model. This suggests that the authors might have used these metrics to assess the performance of the model during training and possibly determined the optimal number of iterations based on these metrics.

Furthermore, the paper mentions that the parameter setting method of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) in this study was done according to the sensitivity analysis method in Heydari and Mountrakis (2018). The authors tested various values for the "gamma" and "cost" parameters and selected the highest overall accuracy achieved from different parameter combinations. This implies that the authors might have used a similar approach to determine when training is complete for the SAE model.

In summary, while the paper does not explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the SAE model, it suggests that the authors might have used metrics such as mean error and the number of misclassified points to assess the performance of the model during training and determine the optimal number of iterations. Additionally, the authors might have used a similar approach to determine when training is complete for the SAE model as they did for the SVM model. However, this is an inference based on the information provided, and it would be best to consult the authors for a definitive answer.
