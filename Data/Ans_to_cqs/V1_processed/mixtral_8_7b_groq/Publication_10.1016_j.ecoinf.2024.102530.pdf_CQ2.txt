Based on the information provided, the deep learning pipeline in this study uses various data formats, primarily raster and vector data types.

The Land Use/Land Cover Map (LULC) data is provided as a 10m resolution raster with different thematic classes, such as agricultural land, forest environments, wetlands, aquatic environments, anthropogenic environments, and bare land. This LULC raster data is sourced from the Ministère de l'Environnement et de la Lutte contre les Changements Climatiques (MELCCFP) of Québec.

Another raster dataset used is the MNT-Lidar, which provides elevation data with a 1m resolution. This dataset is used to derive topographical features for the study.

Weather data is provided in a daily 2.5km resolution raster format. This dataset includes various meteorological factors that influence honey bee flight patterns.

The Database of Parcels and Declared Agricultural Production (BDPPAD) and the Geobase of the Québec Hydrographic Network (GRHQ) are vector datasets used in this study. The BDPPAD provides information about agricultural parcels, while the GRHQ contains hydrographic features.

The Geobase Addresses Québec and the Adresses Québec datasets are also vector data formats, providing geographic location information for various features.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline in this study uses raster data formats for LULC, MNT-Lidar, weather data, and some intermediate derived data. Vector data formats are used for parcel information, hydrographic features, and location data.
