The specific deep learning frameworks used to build the models in the study are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the models were likely built using well-known and widely-used frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. These two frameworks are particularly popular in the field of deep learning and provide extensive support for building and training convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are the primary type of models used in the study.

In the study, five CNN architectures were evaluated: VGG, Inception, and ResNet. These architectures are commonly implemented using deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. For instance, TensorFlow provides official implementations of VGG, Inception, and ResNet models, while PyTorch has a large community-driven collection of implementations for these architectures.

Given the widespread use of TensorFlow and PyTorch in the deep learning community and their support for the specific models used in the study, it is reasonable to assume that one of these frameworks was used to build the models in the study. However, without explicit confirmation in the provided context, it is not possible to definitively state which framework was used.
