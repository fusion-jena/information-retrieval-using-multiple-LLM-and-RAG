The provided context does not discuss deep learning or data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Instead, it focuses on the use of ecological data and Random Forest (RF) models for predicting species distribution.

The RF models are trained using two different training data selection frameworks: non-bootstrapped RF and bootstrapped RF. In the non-bootstrapped RF approach, the RF model is trained using a randomly selected 80% of camera trap locations. In contrast, the bootstrapped RF approach involves subsampling the entire camera trap dataset by randomly selecting 20% of the presence and absence locations. The RF model is then trained using the subsampled dataset and reiterated 100 times, replacing the data used to train the models each time. The final species distribution probability surfaces are obtained by averaging the 100 probability surfaces, independently for each felid.

The authors use univariate RF to investigate the most representative scale for each covariate by performing it for each covariate and selecting the scale with the lowest Out-Of-Bag (OOB) error.

Therefore, the provided context does not contain information on data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
