Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline of the survey on missing data in machine learning by Emmanuel, Tlamelo, Maupong, Thabiso, Mpoeleng, Dimane, Semong, Thabo, Mphago, Banyatsang, and Tabona (2021). However, it can be inferred that they might have used public datasets, as they conducted a survey on missing data in machine learning, which implies the use of existing datasets.

Moreover, the context mentions the use of historical databases and existing data in the intelligent cellular scheme section, which further supports the inference of using public datasets or previously collected data.

On the other hand, the context of other papers refers to the use of sensors and surveys. For instance, FÂ¨oldi and Kuti (2016) studied the characteristics of forest fires and their impact on the environment, and they might have used sensors to collect raw data. Similarly, Ganteaume et al. (2013) conducted a review of the main driving factors of forest fire ignition over Europe, and they might have used surveys or public datasets.

Therefore, while there is no explicit information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline of the survey on missing data in machine learning, it can be inferred that they might have used public datasets. Additionally, other papers in the context mention the use of sensors and surveys for collecting raw data.
