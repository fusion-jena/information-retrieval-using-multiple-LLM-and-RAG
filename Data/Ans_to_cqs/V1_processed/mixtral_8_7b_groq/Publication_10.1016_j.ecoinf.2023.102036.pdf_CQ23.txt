Based on the provided context, the research team appears to have taken several measures to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model, although the specific terms "diverse dataset," "cross-validation," and "stratified splitting" are not explicitly mentioned.

Firstly, the team seems to have addressed the issue of a limited dataset size by "exploit[ing] existing deep learning techniques in combination with statistical fundamentals" (context). This suggests that they may have used data augmentation or transfer learning techniques to increase the size and diversity of their training data, thereby improving the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

Secondly, the team's use of a "standard methodology" developed within a "limited scenario" (context) implies that they may have employed some form of validation or testing procedure to assess the model's performance and generalizability. While the context does not explicitly mention cross-validation, this common machine learning technique involves training a model on one subset of the data and testing it on another, repeating this process with different subsets to obtain a more reliable estimate of the model's performance.

Thirdly, the team's optimization of model training parameters (Table 1, context) suggests that they may have taken steps to prevent overfitting, which can compromise a model's generalizability. By tuning parameters such as the learning rate, momentum, and input size, the team likely aimed to find a balance between a model that fits the training data well and one that can still make accurate predictions on new data.

Lastly, the team's use of TensorBoard to study the performance of their runs (context) indicates that they may have employed visualization tools to assess the model's behavior and identify potential issues that could affect its generalizability.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the terms "diverse dataset," "cross-validation," and "stratified splitting," it suggests that the research team took several measures to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model, including addressing limited dataset size, employing a validation procedure, tuning model parameters, and using visualization tools.
