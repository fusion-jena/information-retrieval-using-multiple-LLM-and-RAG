The context provided does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that TensorFlow, the deep learning framework used in this research, can be easily adapted and deployed on different platforms including desktops, clusters of servers, edge devices, and mobile phones. TensorFlow supports both CPUs and GPUs for training machine learning models. Inception v3, the deep learning model used in this research, has 48 layers and is already trained on more than a million images. It is possible that the researchers used GPUs to train this sophisticated model, but this is not explicitly stated in the context. Therefore, the answer to the query is:


The context does not provide information on the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, TensorFlow supports both CPUs and GPUs for training machine learning models.
