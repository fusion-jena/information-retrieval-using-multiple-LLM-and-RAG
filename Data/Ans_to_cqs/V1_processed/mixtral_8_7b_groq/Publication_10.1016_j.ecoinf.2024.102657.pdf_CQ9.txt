The provided context does not explicitly mention where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it does state that "Data will be made available on request." This suggests that there may not be a public repository available at this time, and interested parties would need to contact the authors to request access to the data.

It is worth noting that the context does not specify which platform or service the data will be made available on, so it is possible that a repository will be created on a platform such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF in the future. However, based on the information provided, it is not currently possible to definitively answer this query.
