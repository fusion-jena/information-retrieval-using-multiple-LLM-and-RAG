The deep learning models for bird species recognition and related tasks were trained on a server with substantial hardware resources. Specifically, the server was equipped with 64 Intel Xeon Gold 6226R CPUs and 192 GiB RAM. Additionally, the server had one NVIDIA RTX A-6000 GPU with 48 GiB RAM. This powerful GPU, along with the CPUs and RAM, provided the necessary computational power to train complex deep learning models efficiently. It is not explicitly mentioned if Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) were used, but considering the use of PyTorch and other Torch libraries, it is likely that the training was performed on GPUs.
