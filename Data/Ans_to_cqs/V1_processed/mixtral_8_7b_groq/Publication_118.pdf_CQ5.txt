The specific dataset used in the deep learning pipeline described in the context is not explicitly named like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it is mentioned that the dataset is "highly annotated and used in previous studies." The extensive annotation of the dataset allowed the feature representation produced by the auto-encoder to be easily evaluated and to be trained on a higher level. Therefore, while the exact name of the dataset is not provided, it is clear that a labeled and previously studied dataset was used in this deep learning pipeline.
