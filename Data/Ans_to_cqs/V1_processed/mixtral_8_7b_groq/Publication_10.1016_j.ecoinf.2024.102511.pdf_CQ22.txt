In the contexts provided, several metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models are mentioned. These include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Accuracy is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of input samples. It is a common metric used to evaluate the performance of a model. However, it may not be the best metric when dealing with imbalanced datasets, where one class has significantly more samples than the other.

Precision, also known as positive predictive value, is the ratio of true positives (correctly predicted positive samples) to the sum of true positives and false positives (incorrectly predicted positive samples). It measures the proportion of correct positive predictions out of all positive predictions made by the model.

Recall, also known as sensitivity, is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives (incorrectly predicted negative samples). It measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive samples out of all actual positive samples in the dataset.

The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall and provides a balanced assessment of both metrics. It is a more reliable metric than accuracy when dealing with imbalanced datasets.

In the context "A survey on image data augmentation for deep learning" by Shorten, Connor, Khoshgoftaar, and Taghi M. (2019), they mentioned that accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are commonly used metrics to evaluate the performance of deep learning models.

In the context "Computational bioacoustics with deep learning: a review and roadmap" by Stowell (2022), they mentioned that accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are commonly used metrics to evaluate the performance of deep learning models in bioacoustic applications.

In the context "MERIDIAN open-source software for deep learning-based acoustic data analysis" by Kirsebom, Frazao, Padovese, Sakib, Yue, and Matwin (2022), they mentioned that accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are used to evaluate the performance of their deep learning model for acoustic data analysis.

Therefore, it can be concluded that accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are commonly used metrics to evaluate the performance of deep learning models in various applications.
