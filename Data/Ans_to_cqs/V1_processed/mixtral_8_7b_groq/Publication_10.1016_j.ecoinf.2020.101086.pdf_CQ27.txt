Based on the provided context, there is no information about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model. The context focuses on the use and correction of sampling bias in species distribution models (SDMs) in ecology, not on the deployment of deep learning models.

The first piece of context, Wisz et al. (2008), discusses the effects of sample size on the performance of species distribution models and the importance of achieving a good compromise in model parameterization. The second piece of context, Moua et al. (2020), presents a new method for correcting the effect of sampling bias in species distribution modeling, specifically in the case of a low number of presence data.

Therefore, without further information, it is not possible to provide a detailed answer on the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model.
