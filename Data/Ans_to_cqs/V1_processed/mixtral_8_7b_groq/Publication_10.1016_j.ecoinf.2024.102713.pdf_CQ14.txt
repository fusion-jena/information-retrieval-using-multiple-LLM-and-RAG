Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the optimization of hyperparameters for a model, such as through methods like grid search or random search. The context focuses on the description of CASE, a system for creating and fulfilling task-based questionnaires related to geo-objects, and a spatial cube called Captures used for multidimensional spatial analysis.

The CASE system has a relational schema that includes Users, Tasks, Questions, Answers, Geo-objects, Areas, and Monitoring sessions. Users fulfill tasks by answering questions, and their visibility is limited to geo-objects within a given maximum distance. Geo-objects are associated with Areas and Monitoring sessions.

The Captures spatial cube is used for multidimensional spatial analysis, with a schema shown in Fig. 6. The cube stores data on captures, precipitations, and other relevant variables, organized in a multidimensional structure. An example of SOLAP (Spatial OLAP) queries and their results is provided in Fig. 7.

Since the context does not mention any model or its hyperparameters, it is not possible to answer the query without additional information.
