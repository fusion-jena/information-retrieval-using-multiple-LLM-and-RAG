The provided context does not contain specific information about the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention the use of deep learning techniques for multi-year El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) forecasts (Ham et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2023). ENSO is a coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomenon that occurs in the equatorial Pacific Ocean and can significantly impact weather patterns across the globe.

In the context of ENSO forecasting, Wang et al. (2023) used a convolutional LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network with an improved attention mechanism and models recombined by a genetic algorithm. The dataset they used was derived from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 and 6 (CMIP5/6) outputs. These datasets contain historical and future climate simulations from various climate models, which can be used for ENSO forecasting and other climate studies.

Additionally, Xiaoqun et al. (2020) presented an ENSO prediction based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) model, but the context does not provide information about the dataset they used.

In summary, the provided context discusses the use of deep learning techniques for ENSO forecasting, specifically LSTM and convolutional LSTM networks. The datasets used in these studies are derived from CMIP5/6 climate simulations, but specific details about the datasets are not provided.
