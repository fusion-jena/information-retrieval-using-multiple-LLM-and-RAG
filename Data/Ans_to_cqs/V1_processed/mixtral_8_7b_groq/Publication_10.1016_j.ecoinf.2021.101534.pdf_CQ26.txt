The provided context discusses various techniques used to augment audio data and improve model performance, particularly in the context of a small dataset. However, it does not directly address the query about techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I will provide a general overview of some common techniques used to address data bias, based on general knowledge in the field of machine learning.

In the context of data preprocessing, data bias refers to the skewed representation of certain classes or groups in the dataset, leading to biased model predictions. To address data bias, several techniques can be employed during the preprocessing stage of the deep learning pipeline. Here are some of the most common techniques:

1. **Stratified splitting**: Stratified sampling is a method of sampling that ensures each subset (e.g., training, validation, or testing) has approximately the same percentage of samples for each class as the original dataset. This technique can help ensure that each subset is representative of the overall dataset and reduce bias.
2. **Oversampling**: Oversampling is a technique used to increase the number of samples in the minority class to balance the dataset. This can be done by replicating samples from the minority class or using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to generate synthetic samples. Oversampling can help reduce bias by ensuring that the model is exposed to a sufficient number of samples from the minority class.
3. **Undersampling**: Undersampling is a technique used to decrease the number of samples in the majority class to balance the dataset. This can be done by randomly selecting a subset of samples from the majority class. Undersampling can help reduce bias by ensuring that the model is not overwhelmed by samples from the majority class.
4. **Diverse data collection**: Collecting a diverse dataset that represents various groups, classes, and scenarios can help reduce bias by ensuring that the model is exposed to a wide range of samples. Diverse data collection can include collecting data from different sources, geographical locations, and demographic groups.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing in the deep learning pipeline, some common techniques include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. These techniques can help ensure that the dataset is representative of the overall population and reduce bias in model predictions.
