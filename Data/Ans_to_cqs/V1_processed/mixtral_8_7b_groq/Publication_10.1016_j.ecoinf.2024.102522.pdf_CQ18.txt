Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, we can infer that the performance of the model was evaluated using various metrics after the training process was completed.

In the first piece of context, Tables 3, 4, and 5 present the summary of the model, a classification table, and variables in the equation, respectively. These tables are based on the final step (step 13) of the model, indicating that the performance of the model was assessed after the training was finished.

In the second piece of context, Tables 8, 9, and 6 are presented, which correspond to the classification of the model, variables in the model, and model validation data table, respectively. These tables also pertain to the final step of the model, suggesting that the performance was evaluated after the training process.

Moreover, in the query, it asks about the strategy to monitor the model performance during training. However, the query does not specify whether it is asking about the training phase or the testing/validation phase. The provided context focuses more on the validation phase, but it does not explicitly mention the strategy during the training phase.

Therefore, while the context provides information on how the model's performance was evaluated after training, it does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during the training phase.
