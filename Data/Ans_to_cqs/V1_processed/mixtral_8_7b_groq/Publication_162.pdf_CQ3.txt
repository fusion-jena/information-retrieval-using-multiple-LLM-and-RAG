The provided context describes the use of bounding box annotation in the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, a standard deep learning classifier (ResNet-50 pre-trained on ImageNet) was trained on cropped bounding box images of detected moths. Additionally, the system uses images obtained from internet image search engines to augment the training dataset. However, since this leads to noisy annotated images, filtering different types of label noise is required.

The context also mentions the use of a feature fusion module to combine the extracted features from both backbones using one 3 × 3 convolution per FPN scale and reduce the number of channels from 2 × 256 to 25
