Based on the provided context, there is no direct link to a code repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket for the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that the data was obtained from Google Earth Engine code (<https://code.earthengine.google.com/>). It is possible that the deep learning pipeline was implemented within the Google Earth Engine codebase.

Additionally, the paper by J. Zhang et al. published in Ecological Informatics (81(2024)10262014) discusses the use of deep learning for predicting NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) in 2030 based on data from 2001 to 2020. The study area is shown in Figure 1 and the data sources are listed in Table 1.

The spatial resolution of the NDVI data was originally 1.875, but it was resampled to a spatial resolution of 500 m as it was considered too coarse. The meteorological data used in the study was provided by CMIP6 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6).

Therefore, while there is no direct link to a code repository for the deep learning pipeline, the paper and data sources provide insight into the methods and data used in the study.
