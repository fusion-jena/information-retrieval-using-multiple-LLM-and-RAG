I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include information about the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the methodology, architecture, and pre-training process of the pipeline but does not mention where the data is stored or shared. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to this query. I recommend checking the original research paper or contacting the authors for more information about the data repository.
