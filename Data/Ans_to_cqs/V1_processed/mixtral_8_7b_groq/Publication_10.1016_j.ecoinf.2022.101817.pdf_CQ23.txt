The text provided gives information about the methods used to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, specifically a CNN model.

Firstly, the authors used a technique called cross-validation. Cross-validation is a resampling procedure used to estimate the skill of machine learning models. It is primarily used in settings where the goal is to forecast and evaluate the performance of a model on unseen data. In the context of the text, the authors performed the validation performance of CNN Model 4 with respect to each of the six environmental conditions using a confusion matrix. This allows for the evaluation of the model's performance on different subsets of the data.

Additionally, the authors used a diverse dataset for training the model. The dataset used is a set of frames processed per second, and power consumption measurements were performed using software-based monitoring. Only MediaTek Pumpkin i500 power consumption was measured using a high-precision external power meter. This suggests that the data used for training the model is diverse and comes from different sources, which helps to ensure the generalizability of the model.

However, the text does not explicitly mention the use of stratified splitting, which is another technique used to ensure the generalizability of machine learning models. Stratified sampling is a method of sampling that ensures each subset of the data contains a representative proportion of the total population.

In summary, the text suggests that the authors used cross-validation and a diverse dataset to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does not explicitly mention the use of stratified splitting.
