The provided context discusses the use of deep learning techniques for identifying a certain number of classes with a small amount of labeled images in each category. However, it does not explicitly mention any strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value.

However, there are some strategies that are commonly used in deep learning to handle randomness, which may have been employed in this study but are not explicitly mentioned. These include:

1. Initialization of weights: The initial weights of the neural network are often randomly initialized to break symmetry and allow for different parts of the network to learn different features.
2. Data shuffling: To prevent overfitting and ensure that the model sees the data in a different order during each epoch, the training data is often shuffled before each epoch.
3. Regularization: Techniques such as dropout and weight decay are used to prevent overfitting by adding a form of randomness to the model during training.
4. Batch normalization: This technique normalizes the inputs of each batch, which can help reduce internal covariate shift and improve the training process.
5. Early stopping: This technique involves stopping the training process before the model starts to overfit, which can be determined by monitoring the performance on a validation set.

In addition, the use of a fixed random seed value can help ensure reproducibility of the results by ensuring that the same random events occur during each run of the model. However, the context does not mention whether a fixed random seed value was used in this study.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention any strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it is possible that some or all of the above strategies were used.
