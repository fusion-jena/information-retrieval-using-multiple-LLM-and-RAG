Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of post-training steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. However, it does mention some steps that are performed after the model training.

After training the model, the data is standardized using the parameters calculated from one of the three datasets, which is defined as the training base. The standardization parameters are then applied to the other two datasets, considered as test bases. This process allows for a consistent evaluation of the model's performance on different datasets.

Furthermore, the role of the training base and test base of each system is swapped, and the Hyperband algorithm is applied to each dataset to determine the best model (hyperparameters + parameters). This step helps in identifying the most suitable dataset to be the training base.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention common post-training steps like saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix, it does mention data standardization and model optimization steps that are performed after training the model.
