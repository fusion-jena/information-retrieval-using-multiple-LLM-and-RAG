Based on the provided context, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Specific Gated Recurrent Unit (SGRU) model, which is an extension of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model. More specifically, it is built upon Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which are a type of RNN designed to learn long-term dependencies in sequential data. The SGRU model includes an additional input layer for processing seasonal time series and a seasonal convolutional layer to extract relevant seasonal features. This model is used for accurately predicting the concentration of atmospheric CO2 over a period of 36 months.
