The provided context discusses research on the urban acoustic environment (AE) and various methods used to analyze it, but it does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query based on the given context.

However, I can provide some general information about common techniques used to address data bias in preprocessing:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on specific criteria (strata), such as class labels, and then ensuring that each stratum is proportionally represented in the training, validation, and test sets.

2. Oversampling: In cases where certain classes are underrepresented in the dataset, oversampling can be used to increase the number of instances from these classes. This can be done by randomly duplicating instances or using techniques like Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to create new instances based on existing ones.

3. Undersampling: Conversely, if certain classes are overrepresented in the dataset, undersampling can be used to reduce the number of instances from these classes. This can be done by randomly removing instances or using techniques like NearMiss to select instances based on their similarity to the minority class.

4. Diverse data collection: Addressing data bias can also involve collecting data from a variety of sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population or phenomenon being studied. This can help reduce bias that may arise from factors such as geographical location, demographics, or time of data collection.

It is important to note that the specific techniques used to address data bias will depend on the nature of the dataset and the goals of the analysis.
