Based on the provided context, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images. The research focuses on image classification tasks, and the deep learning models are trained, validated, and tested using image data. The specific details about the image data are not provided in the context, but it can be inferred that the images are used as input to the deep learning models for training and evaluation. Other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV are not mentioned in the context, so it is assumed that they are not used in this particular deep learning pipeline.
