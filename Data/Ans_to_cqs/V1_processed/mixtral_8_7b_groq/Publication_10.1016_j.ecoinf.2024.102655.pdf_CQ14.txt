Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the machine learning models used in the study were optimized. The text mentions the application of machine learning models in sections 3 and 4, and refers to a water quality dataset in Appendix B, but it does not give details about the specific optimization techniques used for the models' hyperparameters.

Common methods for hyperparameter optimization include grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization. Grid search involves creating a grid of hyperparameter values and training the model for each combination, while random search selects random combinations of hyperparameters from predefined ranges. Bayesian optimization, on the other hand, uses probabilistic models to find the most promising hyperparameter values.

Given the absence of specific information in the context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query. However, it is possible that the authors used one of the aforementioned methods or another technique for hyperparameter optimization. To determine the exact method, it would be necessary to consult the original study or contact the authors.

In summary, the provided context does not contain information on how the hyperparameters of the machine learning models were optimized. Grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization are common methods for hyperparameter optimization, but the specific technique used in this case remains unknown.
