The provided context does not explicitly mention where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it does mention that the workflow is open-source and integrated with the DataMiner Cloud computing platform of the D4Science e-Infrastructure. It also mentions that geospatial data is offered as standardized NetCDF files on a distributed ISO/OGC compliant Spatial Data Infrastructure. Additionally, it mentions that the data is indexed in the D4Science catalogue and can be accessed via the Catalogue Services for the Web (CSW) standard of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). Therefore, it is possible that the data repository is available within the D4Science infrastructure or through the CSW standard of the OGC. However, further information is needed to confirm this.
