The pieces of context provided do not specifically mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, they do imply that the EMViT-Net model is used for environmental microorganism (EM) image classification. Therefore, it can be inferred that the data format used in this specific deep learning pipeline is image data.

More generally, deep learning models can be used with various data formats such as image, audio, video, and CSV. Image data is commonly used in computer vision tasks such as object detection, segmentation, and classification. Audio data is used in speech recognition, music information retrieval, and other audio processing tasks. Video data is used in video analysis, object tracking, and action recognition. CSV data is used in natural language processing, recommendation systems, and other tasks that involve structured data.

The choice of data format depends on the specific task and the type of data available. For example, if the task is to classify images of animals, then image data would be the appropriate choice. If the task is to recognize speech, then audio data would be used.

In summary, while the pieces of context provided do not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that image data is used in the EMViT-Net model for EM image classification. More generally, deep learning models can be used with various data formats such as image, audio, video, and CSV, depending on the specific task and the type of data available.
