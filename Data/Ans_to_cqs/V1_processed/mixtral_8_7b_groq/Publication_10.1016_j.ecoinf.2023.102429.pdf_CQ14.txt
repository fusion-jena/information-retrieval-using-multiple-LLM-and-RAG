Based on the provided context, the hyperparameters of the SVMR model for SOC estimation are optimized using the epsilon-SVR model and Gaussian radial basis function (RBF). However, the specific method of hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search or random search, is not mentioned.

The epsilon-SVR model uses parameters like cost C, epsilon p, and gamma g to achieve the best accuracy and avoid overfitting of SVMR. The optimal parameters are selected based on the RMSEcv values.

The model's performance is evaluated using four parameters: coefficient of determination (R2), root-mean-square error (RMSE), ratio of performance to deviation (RPD), and ratio of performance to interquartile range (RPIQ). The model is considered accurate when the bias is close to zero.

Therefore, while the context provides information on the parameters used for the SVMR model and the evaluation metrics, it does not explicitly mention the method used for hyperparameter optimization.
