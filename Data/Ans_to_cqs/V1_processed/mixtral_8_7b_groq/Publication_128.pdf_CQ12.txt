The deep learning models used in the pipeline are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This is specified by the types of layers and architecture described in the context. For example, the use of convolutional layers, max-pooling, and ReLU activation functions are all indicative of CNNs. Additionally, the specific models mentioned, MobileNet and AlexNet, are both well-known CNN architectures. The InceptionNet model, while not as widely known, also uses convolutional layers and is therefore also a type of CNN.
