The provided context discusses various applications of computational methods, including deep learning, in different fields. However, it does not explicitly enumerate the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. Nevertheless, based on the context, we can infer that image, audio, and possibly CSV data formats are used in deep learning.

The context mentions the use of deep learning for image recognition and classification tasks, such as Atila et al. (2021), which implies the use of image data format in the deep learning pipeline. Additionally, Nanni et al. (2020) are mentioned for their work on audio classification, suggesting the use of audio data format.

Moreover, the context mentions the use of software tools like TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch, which are general-purpose deep learning libraries compatible with various data formats, including image, audio, video, and CSV.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly list the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, we can infer that image, audio, and possibly CSV data formats are used based on the mentioned applications and software tools.
