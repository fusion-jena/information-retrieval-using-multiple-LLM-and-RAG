The context provided does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for the study of pollen species identification using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, it does mention that the dataset consisted of 35,573 images for each of the 12 channels covering 35 species, resulting in a total of 426,876 images. It can be inferred that these images were obtained through some form of imaging technique, but the specific method is not mentioned.

In general, for deep learning applications, raw data can be collected through various methods such as surveys, sensors, public datasets, and other sources depending on the specific application. For example, in the field of computer vision, raw data might be collected through cameras or other imaging devices. In natural language processing, raw data might be collected through text corpora or speech recordings. In the case of the study mentioned, it is likely that the raw data was collected through some form of imaging technique, such as multispectral imaging or fluorescence microscopy, as mentioned in some of the references.
