The specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the pipeline involves the classification of Cervidae images. The CA-Hybrid network is used for this purpose, which is a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT). The network is designed to improve the classification accuracy of objects belonging to the same species.

The context mentions that the CA-Hybrid network is constructed for Cervidae classification and presents experimental results for the same. The network is based on ResNet and ViT, with the integration of CAM into the residual structure of ResNet. The experimental results demonstrate a positive correlation between image size and classification performance, with larger images yielding better classification outcomes.

Therefore, it can be concluded that the dataset used in the deep learning pipeline consists of Cervidae images of varying sizes. However, the specific source or name of the dataset is not provided in the context.
