Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps applied after the model training of the DeepLabV3+ model for remote sensing images. However, it can be inferred that metrics calculation was performed during the validation stage of the model training process.

In the given context, it is mentioned that the training and validation sets were split with a ratio of 70% and 30%, respectively. During the training process, various data augmentation techniques were applied, including flipping, channel exchange, rotation, and noise addition. These techniques were used to enhance the training set and improve the model's performance.

After the completion of the training process, the validation set would have been used to calculate the performance metrics of the model. Commonly used evaluation metrics for semantic segmentation tasks include Overall Accuracy (OA), Cohen's Kappa coefficient, and Intersection over Union (IoU) for each class. However, the specific metrics calculated for this model are not mentioned in the provided context.

As for other postprocessing techniques like generating saliency maps or confusion matrices, there is no information in the given context that suggests these methods were applied. Saliency maps are often used to visualize the regions of the input image that the model focuses on for making predictions. A confusion matrix, on the other hand, is a table that summarizes the predictions made by a classifier, comparing them with the ground truth labels. While these techniques can be helpful for understanding and evaluating model performance, they are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
