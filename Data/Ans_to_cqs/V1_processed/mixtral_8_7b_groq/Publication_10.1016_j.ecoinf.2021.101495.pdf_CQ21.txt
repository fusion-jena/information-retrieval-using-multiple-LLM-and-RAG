Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps applied after the model training. However, we can infer some possible steps from the given information.

Firstly, the context mentions two types of models: a segmentation model and a classification model. For the segmentation model, a common postprocessing step is generating a saliency map, which highlights the important regions of the image identified by the model. This could be used to visualize and evaluate the model's performance.

Secondly, for both the segmentation and classification models, calculating various metrics would be a standard postprocessing step. These metrics could include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, among others. These metrics would provide quantitative evaluations of the model's performance.

Thirdly, the context mentions the use of a confusion matrix for ground truth validation. While this is specifically mentioned in the context of comparing the model's predictions to official sources, it could also be used as a postprocessing step to evaluate the model's performance.

Lastly, the context mentions the use of data augmentation during training, which involves artificially increasing the size of the training set by applying various transformations to the existing images. This could be considered a preprocessing step, but it could also be viewed as a part of the overall model training process, with the resulting augmented images being used as input to the model.

Therefore, while the context does not provide explicit information about the postprocessing steps used after model training, it is likely that steps such as generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, and creating confusion matrices are employed.
