Based on the provided context, there is no information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context mainly discusses the statistical analysis using random forest classification for seagrass meadow image classifications.

However, it does mention that the available validation dataset was used to create a confusion matrix for image classifications. This implies that there is a separate validation dataset, but it does not specify how the data was split into training, testing, and validation sets.

In general, for deep learning model training, it is common to split the dataset into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune the model's hyperparameters and select the best model, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final model's performance.

The criteria for splitting the data can vary depending on the specific problem and dataset. Commonly used methods include random sampling, stratified sampling, and k-fold cross-validation. Random sampling involves randomly selecting a certain percentage of data for each subset. Stratified sampling ensures that each subset has a similar distribution of classes. K-fold cross-validation involves dividing the data into k folds, where each fold is used as the validation set while the remaining k-1 folds are used for training. This process is repeated k times, and the average performance is reported.

Therefore, while the provided context does not specify the criteria used for splitting the data for deep learning model training, it is important to carefully consider the splitting method when working with deep learning models.
