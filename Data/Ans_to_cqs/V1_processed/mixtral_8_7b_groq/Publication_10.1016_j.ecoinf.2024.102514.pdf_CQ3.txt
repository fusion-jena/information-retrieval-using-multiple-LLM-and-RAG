The provided context does not contain information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of machine learning (ML) approaches for assessing water quality, specifically in the context of ecological informatics. It explains the data splitting process and the methodology used to evaluate the performance of various ML algorithms. However, it does not mention any details about data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query.
