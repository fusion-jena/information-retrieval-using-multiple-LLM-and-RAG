Based on the information provided, there is no explicit mention of the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete for the models or tools discussed in the article. However, one common method used to determine training completion in machine learning is when the validation loss plateaus or stops decreasing significantly. This means that the model has likely learned the underlying patterns in the training data and further training would not significantly improve its performance.

In the context of the article, the authors discuss the use of standardization as a pre-processing technique for their data. This technique involves transforming the variables so that they are presented in a similar numerical range, while preserving the distance relations between individual data points. However, the article does not provide information on the specific training process or the criteria used to determine training completion.

Additionally, the authors mention that their analysis is based on data from the Central Statistical Office for four years, and that the population classification system has been changed to incorporate the results of testing for COVID-19. However, there is no mention of how this data was used to train the models or tools discussed in the article.

Therefore, while it is common to use a validation loss plateau as a criterion for determining training completion, the article does not provide specific information on this or any other criteria used for the models and tools discussed.
