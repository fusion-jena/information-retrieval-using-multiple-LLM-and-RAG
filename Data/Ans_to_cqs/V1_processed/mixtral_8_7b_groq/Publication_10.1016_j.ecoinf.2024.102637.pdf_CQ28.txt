The provided context does not explicitly mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the development of a lightweight SIAlex model based on AlexNet, which aims to balance speed and accuracy while reducing computational complexity and deployment costs. The model's design includes merging two convolution layers and optimizing activation functions to maintain nonlinear factors.

However, the text does not provide information on the specific cloud platform (such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform) utilized for deployment. Section 4 of the paper focuses on experimental results and comparing test results of different networks, but it does not mention the platform used for deployment.

In conclusion, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model.
