The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This information is provided in the introduction of the paper, where it mentions that a deep convolutional neural network combined with data augmentation is used for large vocabulary bird species classification from flight calls. Additionally, the training details of the model are provided, which further confirms the use of a CNN. The model is trained using cross-entropy loss via mini-batch stochastic gradient descent, and L2-regularization is applied to the weights of the last two layers. Dropout is also applied to the input of the last two layers with probability 0.5. The CNN is implemented in Python using Lasagne.
