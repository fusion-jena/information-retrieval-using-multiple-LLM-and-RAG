The provided context does not contain information about strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. The context focuses on the implementation and benefits of FAIR principles in genomic data archives, geoscience data publication, and agricultural dataset evaluations.

However, it is worth noting that randomness in deep learning can be managed using various strategies, such as setting a random seed value for reproducibility. A random seed value is an initial value provided to a random number generator, which then generates a sequence of numbers that appear random. By setting a specific seed value, the sequence of random numbers can be replicated, ensuring consistent results across different runs of the model.

In deep learning, randomness can be introduced in various parts of the pipeline, such as weight initialization, data shuffling, and dropout regularization. Setting a random seed value can help manage this randomness and ensure consistent results.

To summarize, the provided context does not contain information about strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, managing randomness in deep learning is crucial for reproducibility and can be achieved using strategies such as setting a random seed value.
