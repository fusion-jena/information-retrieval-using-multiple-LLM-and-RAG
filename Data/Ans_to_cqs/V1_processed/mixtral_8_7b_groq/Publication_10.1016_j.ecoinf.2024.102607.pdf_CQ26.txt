In the context provided, there are details about techniques used to address data bias in the specific case of land use and land cover (LULC) mapping, particularly in the preprocessing stage of a deep learning pipeline.

One such method is sampling strategy optimization. This includes techniques such as major category undersampling (Freeman et al., 2012), minor category oversampling (Rayhan et al., 2017), and combinations of oversampling and undersampling (Naboureh et al., 2020). These strategies aim to balance the training data, which can help prevent overfitting phenomena caused by an incorrect sampling strategy (Gu et al., 2022).

Additionally, Zhang et al. (2020) introduced a hexagonal random-sampling strategy along with a tile model to improve the accuracy of LULC mapping in Madagascar, a region with highly heterogeneous landscapes. This method was designed to mitigate the limitations of the overall model and tackle the problem of unbalanced training data in RF-based LULC mapping.

Another technique mentioned in the context is image presegmentation. This method retains the benefits of object-based classification while eliminating time-consuming parameter adjustments required by traditional segmentation methods. The proposed method is deployed on the GEE platform, making it easily applicable to other regions or different study years, thus increasing its versatility and accessibility for remote sensing and LULC classification tasks.

However, the context does not explicitly mention stratified splitting, diverse data collection, or the incorporation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) in the preprocessing stage for addressing data bias. These techniques might be applied in different stages of the deep learning pipeline or in other contexts.

In summary, the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, as mentioned in the provided context, include sampling strategy optimization (undersampling, oversampling, and their combinations) and image presegmentation. The hexagonal random-sampling strategy was introduced to tackle the specific problem of unbalanced training data in RF-based LULC mapping.
