The provided context does not contain information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Instead, it focuses on various statistical methods and packages used for modeling and analyzing climate data.

The text mentions the use of the "Wind-topo" R package, which downscales near-surface wind fields to high-resolution topography in highly complex terrain using deep learning. However, it does not provide details about the specific data annotation techniques utilized in the deep learning pipeline.

Common data annotation techniques in deep learning include:

1. Bounding box annotation: Drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest in images.
2. Instance segmentation: Labeling each pixel of an object in an image, allowing for precise object localization and shape understanding.
3. Semantic segmentation: Grouping pixels into semantically meaningful categories, like "sky," "road," or "vegetation."
4. Point annotation: Labeling specific points in images or data, such as landmarks on a map or key features in medical images.
5. Line annotation: Drawing lines to represent objects like roads, rivers, or cracks in materials.

These techniques help train deep learning models to understand and process visual data by providing ground truth labels for the algorithms to learn from. However, the context provided does not contain information on which of these techniques were used.
