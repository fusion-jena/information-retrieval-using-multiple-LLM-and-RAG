The provided context discusses the use of early stopping as a regularization technique to prevent overfitting in the training of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. However, it does not mention any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.

However, I can provide some general information about techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.

One common technique is stratified sampling, which involves dividing the dataset into strata based on the distribution of certain variables, and then randomly sampling from each stratum to ensure that the training and testing sets have a similar distribution of those variables. This can help to prevent bias that might arise from an unrepresentative sample.

Another technique is oversampling or undersampling, which involves adjusting the number of examples from certain classes in the dataset to balance the class distribution. Oversampling involves duplicating examples from the minority class, while undersampling involves removing examples from the majority class. These techniques can help to prevent bias that might arise from an imbalanced class distribution.

Diverse data collection is another approach to reducing bias in deep learning models. By collecting data from a wide range of sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population, it is possible to reduce bias that might arise from a narrow or unrepresentative sample.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, there are several techniques that are commonly used for this purpose. These include stratified sampling, oversampling or undersampling, and diverse data collection.
