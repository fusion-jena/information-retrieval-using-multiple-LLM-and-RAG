The provided context does not explicitly mention which deep learning frameworks were used to build the model. However, it does give us some information about the tools and resources used during the preparation of the work.

The authors used ChatGPT 3.5, a generative AI model, to improve the English language of the manuscript. This information is provided in the 'Declaration of generative AI in scientific writing' section. Additionally, the 'Funding' section indicates that the work was supported by the Department of Science and Technology (NMSHE) under Grant No: DST/CCP/TF-3/Phase-2/GBPNIHE/2021. However, neither of these pieces of information directly reveal the deep learning frameworks utilized in the study.

To answer the query accurately, we would need more specific information about the tools, libraries, or frameworks used for building the deep learning model. Common deep learning frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and MXNet, among others. Without further context or information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.

 I'm unable to determine the specific deep learning frameworks used in this work based on the provided context.
