After training the UMAP model, there are several postprocessing steps mentioned in the provided context, including the calculation of certain metrics and the creation of a figure to assess the model's performance as a binary classifier. However, there is no mention of saliency maps or a confusion matrix.

First, testing data is embedded into the UMAP model for projection in the latent space. Then, the nearest neighbor Euclidean distance between species-species (Dss) and background-species (Dsb) is computed for both the training and test data. The cumulative empirical distribution function of the intra-species distance Dss, denoted as Pss, is calculated using a specific equation. Once the Pss function is determined, S = (1- Pss) is calculated for the distances between the background and species.

Additionally, the mutual information coefficient (MIC) is calculated to show the relative importance of the bioclimatic variables as related to latent distance. The MIC measures the amount of information shared by each pair of variables, considering a diverse array of relationships, not simply a linear one.

Furthermore, a group of other indices is estimated with the package PresenceAbsence to evaluate the performance of UMAP as a binary classifier. These indices include the area under the curve (AUC), receiver operating characteristics (ROC), kappa index K, and the point-biserial correlation (COR) index.

Lastly, a figure (Fig. 8A) is presented to assess the UMAP model and the MaxEnt model as binary classifiers, showing a departure from the random prediction in both cases.

In summary, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include the calculation of Pss, S, MIC, AUC, ROC, kappa index K, and point-biserial correlation (COR) index, as well as the creation of a figure to assess the model's performance as a binary classifier.
