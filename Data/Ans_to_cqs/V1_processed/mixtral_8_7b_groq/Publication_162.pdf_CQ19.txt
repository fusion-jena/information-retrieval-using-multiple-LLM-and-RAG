The text provided does not give explicit information about the specific deep learning framework used to build the model. However, it does mention that the model uses a feature fusion module, which combines features from two backbones using a 3 × 3 convolution per FPN scale, and reduces the number of channels from 2 × 256 to 256. It also uses pre-trained weights from the Microsoft COCO dataset for the region proposal network (RPN) classifier and mask head.

Both TensorFlow and PyTorch have the capability to perform such operations. TensorFlow has a built-in function for feature fusion called `tf.keras.layers.concatenate` and PyTorch has a similar function called `torch.cat`. Both frameworks also have pre-trained models and support for the Microsoft COCO dataset.

Therefore, it can be inferred that either TensorFlow or PyTorch was used to build the deep learning model, but the text does not provide enough information to make a definitive conclusion.
