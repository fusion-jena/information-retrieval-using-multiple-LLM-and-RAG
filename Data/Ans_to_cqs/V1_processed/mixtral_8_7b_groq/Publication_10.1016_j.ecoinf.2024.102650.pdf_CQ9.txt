Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context consists of several studies related to environmental protection, text classification, knowledge mining, and named entity recognition. While some of these studies use data and implement deep learning techniques, none of them mention where the data repository for the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
