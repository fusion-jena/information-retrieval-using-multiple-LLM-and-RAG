The provided context does not give information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. Commonly used criteria for determining training completion include validation loss plateau, convergence of the model's performance, or reaching a predefined number of epochs. In the context given, the focus is on comparing the performance of different classification networks for classifying objects of different sizes. The evaluation metric used is classification accuracy, and the networks are compared based on their accuracy for "medium" and "small" objects. The proposed model improves the classification accuracy for both "medium" and "small" objects compared to ResNet50 and ViT. Additionally, the model incorporates Class Activation Mapping (CAM) to attend to important regions, further enhancing classification accuracy. However, the context does not mention any details about the training process or the criteria for training completion.
