The coefficients of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient (LCCC), and bias are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model for estimating water quality parameters using hyperspectral data.

The coefficient of determination (R2) measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable. It ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating a perfect fit. A higher R2 value indicates better model performance.

The root mean square error (RMSE) measures the difference between the predicted and observed values. It is calculated as the square root of the average of the squared differences between the predicted and observed values. A lower RMSE value indicates better model performance.

Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient (LCCC) measures the agreement between the predicted and observed values. It ranges from -1 to 1, with 1 indicating perfect agreement. A higher LCCC value indicates better model performance.

Bias measures the difference between the predicted and observed means. It indicates whether the model systematically overestimates or underestimates the water quality parameter. A bias value close to zero indicates better model performance.

These metrics are used to assess the performance of the deep learning model in the calibration, validation, and testing steps. The deep learning model development is conducted using the R 4.1.0 software.
