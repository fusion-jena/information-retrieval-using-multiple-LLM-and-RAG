The provided context does not include specific information about the learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model. However, it does mention that data augmentation techniques were used to enhance the model's performance.

For data augmentation, the following hyperparameters were utilized:

- Random horizontal flipping with a probability of 0.5.
- Random vertical flipping with a probability of 0.5.
- Random brightness adjustment within the range of 0.9 to 1.1.
- Random contrast adjustment within the range of 0.9 to 1.1.
- Random saturation adjustment within the range of 0.9 to 1.1.
- Random hue adjustment within the range of -0.1 to 0.1.

These data augmentation techniques help increase the diversity of the training dataset, enabling the model to learn more robust features and improve its performance in real-world scenarios.

However, without further information, it is not possible to provide details about the learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model.
